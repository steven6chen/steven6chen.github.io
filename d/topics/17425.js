As of 2010, over 600,000 total knee replacements were being performed annually in the United States and were increasingly common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among older patients in the United States, the per capita number of primary total knee replacements doubled from 1991 to 2010 (from 31 to 62 per 10,000 Medicare enrollees annually) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The number of total knee replacements performed annually in the United States is expected to grow by 673 percent to 3.48 million procedures by 2030 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A variety of pathologic conditions affecting the knee can be treated with total knee replacement, leading to pain relief, to restoration of function, and to mobility.</p><p>The normal knee joint functions as a complex hinge, primarily allowing flexion and extension but also allowing rotation and gliding. The knee joint is made up of three compartments: lateral, medial, and patellofemoral. Damage to the cartilage of one or more compartments may be the result of osteoarthritis (idiopathic or posttraumatic), inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid, psoriatic, etc), avascular necrosis, tumors, or congenital deformities. Over 95 percent of total knee replacements in the United States are performed for osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>The introduction of the &quot;total condylar prosthesis&quot; by Insall and colleagues in 1972 is generally considered to mark the era of &quot;modern&quot; knee replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This prosthesis was the first to replace all three compartments of the knee. There are variations of the original design, and there is increasing interest in partial (unicompartmental) knee replacements. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Choice of prosthesis and fixation technique'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to total knee arthroplasty'</a> below.)</p><p>Modern total knee arthroplasty consists of resection of the diseased articular surfaces of the knee, followed by resurfacing with metal and polyethylene prosthetic components. For the properly selected patient, the procedure results in significant pain relief, as well as improved function and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Despite the potential benefits of total knee arthroplasty, it is an elective procedure and should only be considered after extensive discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives. This topic reviews aspects of total knee arthroplasty including preoperative, operative, and postoperative considerations.</p><p>As with any major surgical procedure, complications may result during or after total knee arthroplasty. Complications of this procedure are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total knee arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main indication for total knee arthroplasty is for the relief of pain associated with arthritis of the knee in patients who have failed nonoperative treatments. Nonoperative therapies for the patient with knee osteoarthritis include activity modification, weight loss (for those who are obese), use of a cane, analgesics, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Total knee arthroplasty may also be necessary in some patients with osteonecrosis. However, the outcomes for such patients may be poorer than for those with osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone#H43\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;, section on 'Total joint replacement'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should have radiographs documenting advanced arthritic changes. If knee pain appears to be out of proportion to the radiographic appearance, other causes should be excluded before arthroplasty is pursued. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Correction of deformity and restoration of function should be considered secondary outcomes of the surgery and should not be considered primary goals. Total knee arthroplasty is performed in patients of all ages (except the skeletally immature).</p><p>The prosthetic joint has a finite lifetime, and the durability of the prosthesis depends upon factors related to the patient and to the arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among the considerations are patient age, underlying disease, and obesity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age &ndash; The longevity of the implant largely reflects the total load that the implant bears. In general, younger total knee arthroplasty recipients use their implants longer and at a more active time in their lives. Thus, the devices are much more likely to fail in their lifetime compared with the implant in the older total knee arthroplasty recipient. The impact of patient age on the risk of revision surgery was evaluated in a large population-based study including 54,276 patients aged 50 or older who had undergone a total knee arthroplasty between 1991 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The lifetime risk of revision surgery in patients who had a total knee arthroplasty over the age of 70 years was about 5 percent, with no difference between men and women. However, the lifetime risk of revision increased with decreasing age, with the highest risk of 35 percent observed in men between the ages of 50 and 54. The risk of surgical revision appears to be even higher in patients under the age of 50, suggesting that total knee arthroplasty should be undertaken cautiously in these patients. In another population-based study that included 120,538 patients who had undergone total knee arthroplasties, almost 5 percent of patients under 50 required revision surgery at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying disease &ndash; As with age, underlying disease also plays a role in the longevity of the prosthesis. Rheumatoid arthritis patients are generally less active, placing less of a load on the joint compared with osteoarthritis patients. A survivorship analysis of 11,606 total knee arthroplasties found that the durability of the prosthesis was shorter in patients with osteoarthritis compared with those with inflammatory arthritis (10-year prosthesis survival of 90 versus 95 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity &ndash; Obesity also has a negative effect on outcome after total knee replacement. In a 2012 meta-analysis, patients who were obese (body mass index &ge;30) demonstrated increased rates of infection (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% CI 1.47-2.47) and revision for any reason (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.67) compared with patients who were not obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3230182\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total knee replacement should not be performed in the following clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active infection in the knee or anywhere in the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nonfunctioning extensor mechanism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor extremity circulation or vascularity</p><p/><p>Neurologic disease affecting the extremity is a relative contraindication to total knee replacement, depending upon the impact of the neurologic disorder on the potential for successful rehabilitation and for improvements in pain and function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall mortality rates of total knee and total hip arthroplasty are similar, approximating 0.5 to 1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful preoperative evaluation must be performed to determine the correct diagnosis, identify the need for surgery, assist with surgical planning, and prevent complications in the perioperative period. General issues relating to preoperative evaluation are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preanesthesia evaluation for noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A thorough preoperative evaluation includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of treatment alternatives (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Review of treatment alternatives'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discussion of risks and benefits of the procedure, its timing, and the alternatives (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Discussion of risks and benefits'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consideration of autologous blood donation (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Blood conservation'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's symptoms should be documented. It is critical to document and investigate any history of concomitant back pain (often described as hip pain by the patient), of hip pain (often described as groin pain by the patient), or of numbness, paresthesia, or pain in the leg. The presence of back or hip symptoms may indicate that knee pain is referred from these sites, while neurologic complaints may arise from peripheral nerve, root, or central nervous system disorders. The interviewer must also inquire about calf pain or claudication, which could indicate peripheral vascular disease or spinal stenosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset &ndash; If the patient is having knee pain, it is important to document the date of onset. It should be noted if the pain was gradual in onset or if there was a specific traumatic event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location &ndash; The location of the pain should be described (eg, medial, lateral, or patellofemoral). Often, the patient will describe these locations as inside the knee, outside the knee, or behind the knee cap, respectively. It should be noted whether the pain is unilateral or bilateral and, if bilateral, which side is worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity and functional effects &ndash; The severity of the pain and the effect of the pain on the patient's activities of daily living and quality of life should be documented. Activities which bring on the pain should be elicited (eg, stair climbing, especially down stairs, is often indicative of patellofemoral pain).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locking, catching, popping &ndash; Other symptoms, such as locking or catching, should be noted as they could indicate pain arising from meniscal pathology. Instability or a history of the patient hearing a pop could indicate ligament injury or rupture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous treatments &ndash; Note any previous treatments the patient has had for the knee pain and their efficacy (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], glucocorticoid injections, hyaluronan injections, physical therapy, alternative treatments, surgical procedures).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbid medical problems/review of systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty must be able to tolerate anesthesia, operative stress including introduction of marrow elements into the circulation, and perioperative blood loss. Since most patients presenting as candidates for total knee replacement are older, specific attention should be paid to the patient's comorbid medical problems and review of symptoms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical problems &ndash; Communication between the patient's primary medical provider and the surgeon or anesthesiologist is paramount. Any history of cardiovascular disease (eg, angina, myocardial infarction, hypertension, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia) or pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease, respiratory infection, pulmonary embolus, sleep apnea, asthma) should be investigated thoroughly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of systems &ndash; Other particularly important components of the review of systems include those indicating the possible presence of cerebrovascular disease (transient ischemic attacks, stroke, carotid stenosis), peripheral vascular disease (claudication, rest pain, nonhealing ulcers, deep venous thrombosis), hematologic disorders (anemia, coagulopathies, blood dyscrasias), endocrine disorders (diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, steroid or glucocorticoid use), urologic disorders (benign prostatic hypertrophy, obstructive uropathy, prostate cancer, urinary tract infections), and infectious disease (HIV, hepatitis, osteomyelitis). Patients should also be screened for malnutrition. Appropriate medical and surgical consults should be obtained preoperatively as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's current medications, including all doses, should be noted. In patients undergoing total knee or total hip arthroplasty, special attention should be paid to the following medications (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> and NSAIDs &ndash; Given an association with perioperative bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], it is recommended to discontinue these medications at least one week prior to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coxibs &ndash; The literature is conflicting whether or not cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-selective inhibitors (coxibs) have a clinically significant effect on the coagulation system. One prospective study of 100 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty with random assignment to receive rofecoxib or placebo revealed no significant difference in perioperative bleeding or in international normalized ratio (INR) between the two groups. Rofecoxib was subsequently withdrawn from the worldwide market because of an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Ischemic cardiovascular disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other studies have demonstrated and interaction between coxibs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, though in varying degrees and with different agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. The ultimate decision should lie with the operating surgeon. Some surgeons prescribe coxibs preoperatively to assist with postoperative pain management, so more information should become available concerning this topic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulants &ndash; Prior to undergoing total knee arthroplasty, patients should have a normal prothrombin time (PT) and INR. This usually requires discontinuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> a minimum of three to five days prior to surgery. High-risk patients (eg, patients with mechanical heart valves) either should be bridged with a low molecular weight heparin or should be admitted preoperatively and heparinized. Heparin should be stopped six hours prior to surgery, and a partial thromboplastin time should be checked. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; As previously noted, active septic arthritis is a contraindication to total joint arthroplasty. Patients with resolved infections should be off antibiotics at least 48 hours prior to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin or oral hypoglycemics &ndash; Insulin should be reduced or should be given in a decreased dose depending upon the scheduled time for surgery. Oral hypoglycemic agents should be held the day of surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of blood glucose in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids &ndash; Glucocorticoids should ideally be tapered to the lowest possible dose to decrease suppression of the immune system and minimize the risk of interfering with wound healing. Depending upon the patient's normal dose, patients are sometimes given &quot;stress-dose&quot; glucocorticoids in the perioperative period to avoid possible effects of adrenal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> &ndash; We continue methotrexate (MTX) perioperatively in patients with normal renal function and with absence of active infection whose disease is controlled by the drug. The use of MTX and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the perioperative setting is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H42\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic agents'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative evaluation and perioperative management of patients with rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Nonbiologic DMARDs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biologics &ndash; The use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>) and other biologic therapies used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory rheumatic disorders has been associated with an increased risk of both typical and atypical infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and mycobacterial infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As a result, anti-TNF agents and other biologic DMARDs are generally avoided in the perioperative period. The use of these agents in the perioperative setting is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H42\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic agents'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative evaluation and perioperative management of patients with rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Biologic DMARDs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous allergies to antibiotics and the type of reaction (eg, rash, shortness of breath, anaphylaxis) should be clearly documented. Also, the patient's use and tolerance (or intolerance) of opioid analgesics should be investigated. Proper and prominent documentation will prevent errors in the perioperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who may be candidates for total knee replacement need to undergo a thorough musculoskeletal examination. Proper examination of the arthritic knee includes observation, palpation, and assessment with special manual tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observing the patient's gait pattern and skin are important part of the physical examination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gait &ndash; Among the abnormal gaits that may be observed in patients with knee pain are the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antalgic gait &ndash; Patients with knee arthritis will often have an antalgic gait. The patient with an antalgic gait spends a shorter time bearing weight on the affected side because of pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Knee thrust &ndash; An abnormal medial or lateral movement of the knee while walking (thrust) may indicate ligament instability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trendelenburg gait &ndash; With a Trendelenburg gait, the patient shifts the torso over the affected hip, reducing the load on the hip that is imposed by stabilizing the pelvis and thereby decreasing pain. This suggests the presence of hip joint disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weakness of the gluteus medius muscle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin &ndash; The skin over both of the entire lower extremities should be thoroughly inspected for any abrasions, ulcerations, swelling, redness, vascular changes, or infections. Surgical implantation of a prosthesis is contraindicated in the presence of an active infection. Any previous scars over the knee should be noted. Wound healing problems are common around the knee, and previous incisions need to be taken into account at the time of surgery. Any gross deformities (eg, varus, valgus, recurvatum, flexion contracture) should be noted. Deformities will be definitively assessed with radiographs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The knee should be palpated for an effusion. Keeping a hand on the patella while passively taking the knee through a range of motion will allow the clinician to detect patellofemoral crepitus. Medial and lateral joint line tenderness on palpation is often observed in arthritis but also may indicate meniscal pathology. Distal pulses, including the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis, should also be assessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment with other manual tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous maneuvers are performed to aid the preoperative assessment as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Range of motion &ndash; In order to assess the extensor mechanism and to document preoperative range of motion, maximal active and passive knee flexion and extension are recorded. Joint contracture is noted. It is important to assess for pain with passive hip motion on the side of the affected knee, especially hip internal rotation. This maneuver can identify whether pain perceived in the knee is actually of hip origin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle testing &ndash; Motor strength and tone should be tested in the entire lower extremity with special attention devoted to the quadriceps or extensor mechanism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve testing &ndash; In addition to checking motor strength, sensory and deep tendon reflex assessments (patella and ankle jerks) should be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligament examination &ndash; The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and, especially, the medial collateral ligament (MCL) are highly important structures to preserve during a total knee replacement. Preoperative assessment of the stability or degree of contracture of these ligaments is indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Collateral ligaments &ndash; The LCL and MCL are tested with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion with varus and valgus stresses, respectively. In a varus knee, the LCL is usually lax at surgery, while the MCL is contracted. In a valgus knee, the LCL is usually contracted, and the MCL is lax. Evidence of MCL incompetence may indicate the need for a more constrained prosthesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cruciate ligaments &ndash; The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is sacrificed in the majority of total knee replacement designs, and therefore its assessment is not crucial. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) may be retained or sacrificed at the time of surgery. It may be assessed by the posterior drawer test with the knee flexed to 90 degrees and with application of a posterior directed force on the tibia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meniscal examination &ndash; If the patient is having predominantly mechanical symptoms, such as locking or catching of the knee, a meniscal tear may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Such patients may benefit from a less invasive arthroscopy, although arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in the presence of moderate to severe osteoarthritis does not appear to be any more efficacious than nonoperative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Review of treatment alternatives'</a> below). Meniscal examination is performed with a McMurray test and with the Apley Compression test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniscal-injury-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniscal injury of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spine and hip examination &ndash; It is important to exclude referred pain to the knee originating in the spine or hip. Elicitation of the knee pain with straight leg raising or with hip motion (especially internal rotation) should raise suspicion and warrants further study including imaging of the lumbar spine, the hip, or both.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous imaging modalities are available to assist with the management of a painful knee including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs &ndash; Plain radiographs are the mainstay of diagnosis, preoperative planning, and postoperative assessment of arthritis and total knee arthroplasty. A minimum of three views (standing anteroposterior view, lateral view, and a tangential patella view) should be obtained. Other views are sometimes utilized. For example, a standing 45 degree posteroanterior radiograph may be ordered to more accurately determine joint space narrowing of the medial and lateral sides. A long-length, three-joint, standing film is obtained to determine the anatomic and mechanical alignment of the limb (eg, varus, valgus), which is helpful for preoperative planning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The three basic views that should be obtained in all patients are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Standing anteroposterior view &ndash; The anteroposterior view should be obtained with the patient standing in order to normally load the joint. The medial and lateral joint spaces should both be assessed for narrowing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lateral view &ndash; The lateral view is used to assess the patellofemoral joint and the position of the patella (eg, patella baja, patella alta).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tangential patellar view &ndash; The patellofemoral joint space should be assessed on a tangential patellar view (&quot;sunrise,&quot; &quot;skyline,&quot; or Merchant view).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) &ndash; MRI is not indicated in the majority of patients being assessed for a total joint replacement. While MRI is more sensitive than plain radiographs in detecting early osteoarthritis changes, total knee replacement candidates, as a rule, have more advanced, radiographically apparent disease. MRI visualizes meniscal tears which are nearly ubiquitous in patients with advanced osteoarthritis (OA) and which may not be responsible for symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the patient with knee pain and mild osteoarthritic change on plain radiographs, MRI may be helpful in identifying an alternative source of discomfort, such as a meniscal tear or osteonecrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative laboratory requirements vary depending upon the patient's health and institutional policy, but they typically include a complete blood count, basic chemistry panel, and coagulation studies (prothrombin time, INR, and partial thromboplastin time). An electrocardiogram and a chest radiograph are usually required depending upon patient age and anesthesia policy. Urinalysis and urine culture are obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Review of treatment alternatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to take into account the history, physical examination, and radiographs to determine if the patient could benefit from less invasive alternative treatment.

The patient must be aware of the rigors of the rehabilitation following total knee replacement. A summary of this information is presented separately for patients considering this procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Total knee replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of total knee arthroplasty are presented in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-knee-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total knee arthroplasty&quot;</a>). The following is a brief summary of potential risks, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetic and intraoperative events &ndash; As with any major operation, there are risks associated with the administration of anesthetics and with intraoperative misadventures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboembolism &ndash; Deep venous thrombosis and venous thromboembolism are potential and sometimes lethal complications. The risk of proximal venous thrombosis following knee surgery is reduced by the use of anticoagulation, but it may still occur during use of prophylactic adjusted-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or of unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin. Symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis has been documented following knee replacement surgery in up to 3 percent of patients despite pharmacologic prophylaxis. The risk of pulmonary embolism is approximately 1 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; Infectious complications are uncommon but potentially serious. Prosthetic joint infection may result in prolonged hospitalization, in the need for removal of the infected prosthesis, and in an extended course of antibiotic treatment, followed by reimplantation. Up to 1 percent of total knee replacement recipients experience an infected prosthesis over the course of the first postoperative year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-prosthetic-joint-and-other-types-of-orthopedic-hardware-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of prosthetic joint and other types of orthopedic hardware infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patellofemoral disorders &ndash; Various disorders of the prosthetic patellofemoral joint and of the extensor mechanism may occur, including patellar subluxation, dislocation, component loosening, fracture, impeded patellar mobility (&quot;clunk&quot; phenomenon), and rupture of the extensor mechanism (quadriceps or patellar tendon ruptures).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve injuries &ndash; Intraoperative or postoperative injuries to the peroneal nerve may occur, leading to tibialis anterior muscle weakness (drop foot) and sensory loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial injuries &ndash; Popliteal or other arterial injuries may lead to increased blood loss and to the need for arterial repair. Arterial thrombosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral embolization may occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periprosthetic fractures &ndash; Fracture proximal to the femoral component (supracondylar fracture) or distal to the tibial implant may occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound problems &ndash; Wound dehiscence increases the risk of prosthetic joint infection and may require additional plastic surgical procedures to achieve adequate coverage of the incision and a functional range of knee motion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prosthetic wear and failure &ndash; Polyethylene wear can provoke an inflammatory response that sometimes leads to loosening of the prosthesis. If this leads to failure of the prosthetic knee, revision arthroplasty may be necessary.</p><p/><p>Bilateral simultaneous knee arthroplasty has been associated with increased risks of complications, and patients should be counseled as such. A 2007 meta-analysis demonstrated that simultaneous bilateral knee replacement carries an increased risk of serious cardiac and pulmonary complications, as well as increased mortality, compared with staged bilateral or unilateral surgery. The optimal period of time to stage bilateral procedures has not been well-established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted in the introduction, the expected benefits of total knee arthroplasty are pain relief, restoration of function, and mobility. Modest improvement in varus or valgus deformities may be achieved. Flexion contractures are more difficult to overcome.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain relief &ndash; A systematic review documented that about 20 percent of recipients of total knee replacement and 10 percent of recipients of total hip replacement (THR) report persistent or recurrent pain in the year or so following surgery. Some of these patients are nonetheless satisfied, but it is important for patients to bear in mind that the risk of less than complete pain relief is not trivial. Research is ongoing to identify risk factors for suboptimal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional improvement &ndash; Patients generally experience dramatic improvements in the capacity to perform daily and community activities. Patients with worse functional status preoperatively tend to gain the most function following surgery, while patients with the best preoperative function preoperatively tend to achieve the highest level of postoperative functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. While activities of daily living are generally easier to perform due to decreased knee pain following total knee arthroplasty, objective measures of knee function (eg, range of motion) typically improve less. Only 23 percent of knees were rated as having excellent function when followed up a mean of 17 years following initial surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The postoperative motion that can be expected is highly dependent on the preoperative motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correction of deformities &ndash; Surgical technique allows a normal or near-normal amount of knee valgus to be restored. Knee flexion contractures can be reduced in most cases by appropriate component selection and by soft tissue release. As an example, in one retrospective study of 542 knee arthroplasties in knees with flexion contractures, 95 percent had residual flexion deformities of three degrees or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Severe deformities may not be amenable to correction during total knee arthroplasty.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood conservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty are at risk of significant perioperative blood loss. Blood conservation techniques for total joint arthroplasty are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Blood conservation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERNATIVES TO TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed earlier, nonsurgical treatment should be tried before resorting to surgery for osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis.</p><p>The suitability of surgical approaches other than total joint arthroplasty depends upon several factors, including the severity of the disease (eg, early chondral changes with minimal loss of joint space); the extent and location of disease, including whether it is unicompartmental (lateral, medial, or patellofemoral) versus bi- or tricompartmental; the disease process causing joint pathology (eg, osteoarthritis [OA], rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, etc); and the patient's preferences for the risks and advantages associated with each option.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsurgical treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before proceeding to total knee arthroplasty for an indication of osteoarthritis, a multifaceted regimen of nonoperative treatment should be attempted. The efficacy of these nonsurgical interventions, even with advanced osteoarthritis, has been supported in two randomized, controlled clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Although not as effective as total knee arthroplasty, nonsurgical interventions appear to offer significant benefit with lower risk and may be appropriate in patients looking to avoid or postpone surgical intervention, or in patients not fit for surgery.</p><p>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other forms of inflammatory arthritis should have failed medical management before proceeding with total knee arthroplasty.

Limited data were available comparing high tibial osteotomy with other surgical procedures for OA of the knee, such as unicompartmental arthroplasty (see <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Unicompartmental knee replacement'</a> below) or other types of osteotomies for varus knee OA.</p><p>The outcomes that can be expected are illustrated by one long-term (15-year average follow-up) retrospective study of 102 high tibial osteotomies for varus knees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Since that time, there have been numerous design variations and varying results. As a result, the role for unicompartmental knee replacement in the treatment of the arthritic knee is the subject of controversy.</p><p>Detractors claim that only resurfacing one compartment often results in incomplete pain relief and in earlier prosthetic failure and makes for a more difficult revision. Proponents claim that the procedure allows sparing of the normal anatomic ligament structure, resulting in more natural kinematics of the knee and in the preservation of the patellofemoral joint and other compartment (leaving more bone stock for subsequent revision surgery). Proponents attribute poorer survival compared with total knee arthroplasty to flaws in earlier designs of unicompartmental prostheses.</p><p>There has been a resurgence of interest in unicompartmental knee replacement as an alternative both to total knee replacement and to osteotomy in the treatment of patients with unicompartmental, noninflammatory arthritis. Widely accepted contraindications to unicompartmental knee replacement include inflammatory arthritis, less than 90 degrees of flexion, greater than 15-degree flexion contracture, or a large deformity not amenable to correction with available unicompartmental designs.</p><p>Unicompartmental knee replacement may be successful in the appropriately selected patient, as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 28 unicompartmental knee replacements in patients with an average age of 52 years found early results (two to six years) to be superior to results of osteotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A five-year retrospective study of 102 patients compared unicompartmental knee replacement with total knee replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Those who had the unicompartmental surgery had an increased range of motion, less pain, and a faster recovery than those who had a total knee arthroplasty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of the results of using a Lubinus patellofemoral prosthesis for patients with isolated disease of this compartment noted good to excellent results in 64 percent of 45 arthroplasties in 34 patients and noted unsatisfactory outcomes in 17 percent of the procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A subsequently developed prosthesis may have better outcomes.

It remains a viable salvage option in cases of multiple prosthetic infections, of failed extensor mechanism, and of other complex situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are positioned supine on the operating table. General, spinal, or epidural anesthesia may be used. Prophylactic antibiotics are given prior to skin incision. Most often, a tourniquet is used (although not always).</p><p>The knee is typically approached via a midline skin incision. If previous scars exist, all possible attempts are made to incorporate previous skin incisions. With multiple scars, the most lateral is usually used because of blood supply to the flap. Occasionally, preoperative plastic surgery consult is needed in knees with multiple scars. The majority of surgeons use a medial parapatellar approach to enter the knee. With this approach, an incision is made in the quadriceps tendon above, down along the medial side of the patella, down to the medial aspect of the tibial tubercle. Occasionally, the lateral parapatellar approach is used. Subvastus and midvastus approaches are experiencing a resurgence in use in combination with &quot;minimally invasive&quot; techniques.</p><p>Soft tissue balancing is a critical component of total knee arthroplasty. Varus knees are usually tight medially and lax laterally. Valgus knees are usually tight laterally and lax medially. Soft tissue balance is typically achieved by performing releases on the collateral ligament on the tight side. Capsular releases are usually performed first. In the majority of total knee replacements, every effort is made to preserve the integrity of the lateral collateral ligament and, especially, the medial collateral ligament. The anterior cruciate ligament is almost always sacrificed. As discussed below, the posterior cruciate ligament may be retained or sacrificed.</p><p>Implant selection is surgeon-dependent. The role of techniques such as minimally invasive knee replacement and surgical computer-assisted navigation remains to be defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF PROSTHESIS AND FIXATION TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implant selection is surgeon-dependent. All total knee arthroplasties consist of a femoral component, a tibial component, and a patella component (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F97135\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97135 \">image 1</a>). There are a large number of manufacturers and designs of knee prostheses. Most available systems are modular with a metal tibia tray with polyethylene inserts. Designs either can retain the posterior cruciate ligament (eg, PCL retention) or remove the PCL (eg, PCL sacrificing). PCL sacrificing is also called substitution, because the tibial component requires the addition of a post to provide the stability normally provided by the PCL. Fixation techniques include cemented (both femur and tibia are cemented), uncemented, or hybrid (usually femur is uncemented and tibia is cemented).</p><p>There is no consensus on prosthesis choice, and there is wide variance among nations, states, cities, and individual surgeons. This variance in design and technique makes it difficult to analyze and generalize reported results. Approximately 90 to 95 percent survivorship of total knee arthroplasties is expected at 10-years follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Retention versus sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both PCL retention and PCL sacrificing designs have compelling theoretical reasons for their existence.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Theoretical advantages of PCL retention include greater range of motion due to reproduction of femoral rollback, decreased stress on the implant leading to lower rates of failure, improved proprioception in stair climbing, and preservation of bone stock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Theoretical advantages of PCL sacrificing include more reliable correction of deformity; easier balancing of the knee; and elimination of excessive femoral rollback, which may compromise implant fixation and which may increase conformity of the prosthesis, thus leading to decreased contact stresses and to decreased polyethylene wear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p>However, most of the purported advantages for either approach have not been realized in clinical studies, and excellent results may be obtained with either design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/51-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-57</a>]. A systematic review of 17 randomized trials with 1810 patients assessed the benefits and harms of retention compared with sacrifice of the PCL in total knee arthroplasty in osteoarthritis patients. It found no clinically relevant differences with respect to range of motion, pain, clinical, and radiological outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Fixation technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of total knee arthroplasties have been performed with cemented components, and the long-term follow-up studies available have been with cemented implantation. Generally, cementless implantation in total knee arthroplasty is considered to be less desirable due to higher incidence of tibial loosening, polyethylene wear, and osteolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, some surgeons have obtained excellent results (&gt;90 percent survival of the primary arthroplasty) at 10 or more years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Patella resurfacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patella resurfacing, typically with a polyethylene button, remains a controversial topic in total knee arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The primary reason to resurface the patella is the belief that it lessens anterior knee pain and therefore reduces the need for a second operation to resurface the patella. This may be offset by advantages of not resurfacing, which include preservation of bone stock and reduction of patellofemoral complications such as fractures and loosening.

These include robotics and individualized cutting guides (which are based on the patient's own anatomy using a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] scan) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

Single-injection spinal is a commonly used NA technique for uncomplicated primary total knee arthroplasty. Epidural or CSE are used for procedures that are expected to last more than approximately two hours and if postoperative epidural analgesia is planned. The plan for postoperative anticoagulation should be discussed with the surgeon before finalizing plans for regional anesthesia techniques. Epidural analgesia may require coordination with administration of heparin or other anticoagulants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidural and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455456790\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anesthetic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of anesthetic technique should be based on patient comorbidities and patient choice. The literature comparing GA with NA for total knee arthroplasty is inconclusive for a number of patient-important outcomes. A meta-analysis of 29 observational and randomized studies (approximately 10,500 patients) that compared GA with NA for total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty reported no differences in mortality, chest infection, or thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Length of hospital stay was reduced with NA (weighted mean difference -0.4 days [-0.76 to -0.03]).

Multimodal strategies for postoperative pain control after total knee arthroplasty have reduced the need for intravenous opioids and may include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), regional anesthesia techniques, and periarticular local anesthetic infiltration.

Multiple studies have reported reduced perioperative complications and enhanced patient satisfaction with the use of peripheral nerve blocks compared with traditional opioid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sensory innervation of the knee includes the femoral, sciatic, and obturator nerves. These nerves can be individually blocked, but, more commonly, a single block of the femoral nerve or its distal sensory branches (ie, the saphenous nerve and nerve to vastus medialis at the adductor canal) is performed to provide partial, usually adequate, analgesia (since the vast majority of the innervation of the knee is from the femoral nerve). The adductor canal block is increasingly used because it is associated with less quadriceps weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>], which may therefore facilitate early mobilization and rehabilitation and may reduce the risk of patient falls while the block is in effect.

This technique has not been standardized; solutions including long-acting local anesthetics and adjuvants (eg, NSAIDs, opioids) or liposomal local anesthetic solutions are often used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lumbar epidural analgesia</strong> &ndash; Postoperative continuous epidural analgesia is often used if epidural or CSE anesthesia is used for surgery.

Interventions that attempt to preserve knee motion include the use of a knee immobilizer and pillows under the operative foot while in bed to maintain extension and to avoid flexion contracture. Range of motion exercises, supervised by a physical therapist, should be started as soon as possible. Rehabilitation goals should be realistic. Although the flexion deformities may be partially or completely corrected by total knee arthroplasty, the maximal knee range of motion may not be much improved, and the postoperative motion is determined largely by the preoperative arc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A well-structured physical therapy (PT) program including range of motion, gait training, quadriceps strengthening, and training in activities of daily living is an important component of the rehabilitation process. A 2007 meta-analysis of five randomized trials concluded that participation after discharge from the hospital in a functional exercise program supervised by a physical therapist improves knee function and range of motion in the short term when compared with routine care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Inpatient rehabilitation has not been shown to result in improved mobility compared with home-based PT in patients who have undergone an uncomplicated total knee arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of continuous passive motion (CPM) devices to improve knee range of motion and prevent venous thromboembolism is common in postoperative rehabilitative care in many institutions. However, CPM does not provide sufficient benefit to justify its inconvenience and expense. Two meta-analyses published in 2014 found that the addition of CPM to standard therapies did not have clinically significant effects on range of motion, pain, function, quality of life, or prevention of venous thromboembolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>].</p><p/><p>In the long term, patients may be encouraged to pursue low- to moderate-intensity, low-impact exercises, as patients who are more active do not appear to increase their risk of needing revision arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-knee-arthroplasty/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

For the properly selected patient, the procedure results in significant pain relief, as well as improved function and quality of life. Despite the potential benefits of total knee arthroplasty, it is an elective procedure and should only be considered after extensive discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main indication for total knee arthroplasty is for the relief of pain associated with arthritis of the knee in patients who have failed nonoperative treatments. Correction of deformity and restoration of function should be considered secondary outcomes of the surgery and should not be considered the primary indication. The prosthetic joint has a finite lifetime, and factors upon which the durability of the prosthesis depends include patient age, underlying disease, and presence of obesity, as well as prosthesis and surgical factors. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to total knee replacement include active infection in the knee or anywhere in the body, a nonfunctioning extensor mechanism, and poor extremity circulation or vascularity. Neurologic disease affecting the extremity is a relative contraindication. Overall 30-day mortally rates of total knee and total hip arthroplasty are similar. (See <a href=\"#H3230182\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful preoperative evaluation must be performed to determine the correct diagnosis, to identify the need for surgery, to assist with surgical planning, and to prevent complications in the perioperative period. A thorough evaluation includes particular elements of the history, a physical examination, imaging and laboratory studies, a review of treatment alternatives, and discussions of the benefits and risks of the procedure and of autologous blood donation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The suitability of surgical approaches other than total joint arthroplasty depends upon several factors, including the severity of the disease, the number of compartments involved, and the disease process causing joint pathology. Alternatives include nonsurgical treatment, arthroscopy, osteotomy, unicompartmental knee replacement, and knee arthrodesis. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to total knee arthroplasty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are positioned supine on the operating table, and regional, general, spinal, or epidural anesthesia may be used. Prophylactic antibiotics are given prior to skin incision. A tourniquet is often used. Implant selection is surgeon-dependent. The roles of minimally invasive knee replacement and surgical computer-assisted navigation, for which long-term follow-up is lacking, are poorly defined. All total knee arthroplasties consist of a femoral component, a tibial component, and a patella component. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Surgical technique'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Choice of prosthesis and fixation technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total knee arthroplasty can be performed with general or neuraxial (ie, spinal, epidural, or combined spinal epidural [CSE]) anesthesia. Regional anesthesia techniques <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> periarticular local anesthetic infiltration are increasingly used as part of multimodal opioid-sparing strategies for postoperative pain management.
