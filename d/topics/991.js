This injury usually causes swelling and pain in the knee. It also makes the knee feel unstable, or like it is &quot;giving out.&quot;</p><p>A ligament is a tough band of tissue that connects 1 bone to another. The anterior cruciate ligament, also called the &quot;ACL,&quot; connects the thigh bone to the shin bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77293\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77293 \">figure 1</a>). It works with another ligament to keep the knee from moving too far forward or backward.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046857\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an ACL tear?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When people have an ACL tear, they often say they heard a &quot;pop&quot; when the injury happened. This injury tends to happen when people are playing sports that involve quick changes in direction, such as basketball or soccer. It can also happen when a person slows down suddenly while changing direction, or on landing from a jump.</p><p>Within a few hours of an ACL injury, the knee usually swells. It can also feel unstable or wobbly, like it can't hold your weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046864\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test to check for an ACL tear?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse thinks you might have an ACL tear, he or she can order an imaging test called an MRI. This test creates a picture of the inside of your knee. But an MRI is not always needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046871\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people feel better if they do certain exercises. Ask your doctor or nurse which exercises might help you feel better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046878\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have the symptoms described above or if you think you might have an ACL injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046885\"><span class=\"h1\">How are ACL tears treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Everyone with an ACL tear has to do special exercises for a while after their injury. These exercises are called &quot;rehabilitation,&quot; or &quot;rehab.&quot; They help you strengthen your knee and get back the ability to move it around.</p><p>After the swelling and pain of the injury get better, some people have surgery to rebuild the torn ACL. For this surgery, doctors remove and replace the damaged ACL with a strip of tissue taken from another part of the leg. (Sometimes the tissue used for repair comes from another person's leg.) After surgery, people must do a lot more rehab to make sure the rebuilt ACL works well.</p><p>But surgery is not always needed. Some people with a torn ACL do not have surgery and instead do more rehab work.</p><p>The decision about whether to have surgery depends on a lot of things, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How unstable your knee feels even after doing some rehab</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How severe your injury is</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What kinds of physical activity you do. (If you are very active or do a lot of things that involve twisting or turning your knee, surgery might be a good idea.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How old you are</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you have other health problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you are willing to do a lot of rehab after surgery to make sure the repairs work well</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046892\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide whether to have surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You and your doctor will work together to decide if surgery is right for you. As you talk about surgery, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How will my rehab be different if I have surgery or do not have surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of not having surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well will my knee work if I have surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will I be able to keep doing my favorite physical activities if I do not have the surgery?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046899\"><span class=\"h1\">Can ACL injuries be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting an ACL injury if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay active and do exercises that make the muscles that support the knee strong and flexible. As part of your training, work on your balance, for example by standing on 1 foot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn how to move so there is less stress on the knee during sports. This might involve talking to a fitness expert about how to move and position your body, especially during physical activity.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25047037\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anterior cruciate ligament injury (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
