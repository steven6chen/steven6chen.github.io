It is also called &quot;pseudotumor cerebri.&quot;</p><p>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension causes headaches and vision loss. These symptoms are similar to symptoms caused by a brain tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22627945\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes idiopathic intracranial hypertension?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors do not know the cause. But idiopathic intracranial hypertension is more common in women and obese people.</p><p>Certain medicines seem to make some people more likely to get idiopathic intracranial hypertension. These medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tetracycline</a>, high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin A</a>, and growth hormone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22627962\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bad headaches &ndash; Some people say the worst pain is right behind the eyes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short periods of vision loss &ndash; This can happen in 1 or both eyes. It usually lasts a few seconds and might happen once in a while or several times a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dimming of vision</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble seeing things at the edge of your line of sight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double vision</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seeing flashing lights</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noises inside your head &ndash; The noise might sound like rushing water or wind. It often pulses in time with your heartbeat and can come and go.</p><p/><p>In rare cases, people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension lose their vision forever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22627977\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye exam &ndash; An eye doctor will use special tools to look for swelling at the back of your eye, near the optic nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70420 \">figure 1</a>). Most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension have swelling of the optic nerve. The optic nerve connects the eye to the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual field test &ndash; This test checks how well you can see things that are at the edges of your line of sight. The test will be repeated from time to time to check your optic nerves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI or CT scan &ndash; These are imaging tests that take pictures of the inside of your brain. Your doctor can use them to check if a tumor or other problem is causing your symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor puts a needle into your lower back to measure the fluid pressure inside your skull.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22627992\"><span class=\"h1\">How is idiopathic intracranial hypertension treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; If you are overweight, your doctor will recommend a diet or weight loss program. If you are very overweight and cannot lose weight by dieting, your doctor might recommend medicines or weight-loss surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Your doctor might prescribe medicines that help lower the amount of spinal fluid your body makes. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He or she might also recommend medicines used to prevent and treat headaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Doctors only do surgery if losing weight and taking medicines don't help enough. The kinds of surgery include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shunting &ndash; In this surgery, a doctor puts a device called a &quot;shunt&quot; into a fluid-filled space inside your brain. The shunt is connected to a tube that is placed under your skin and that empties into your belly. The shunt helps drain the extra spinal fluid from your brain and can relieve the pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Optical nerve sheath fenestration &ndash; In this surgery, a doctor cuts a tiny, window-like hole in the tissue that covers the optic nerve. This helps lower pressure on the nerve to help save your vision.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22628007\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
