In some cases, the clonal process producing the M-protein is malignant and is associated with evidence of neoplastic disease infiltrating bone, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, or other organs (eg, multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia). In other cases, the M-protein is produced by a small limited premalignant clonal expansion, and causes no symptoms (eg, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, premalignant disorders in medicine have limited clinical consequences until malignant transformation occurs. However, in the case of plasma cell disorders since the clonal cells secrete immunoglobulin antibodies, disabling or fatal disease can occur even when the clonal expansion is premalignant due to one or more potential adverse properties of the secreted M-protein, such as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to agglutinate red cells (eg, cold agglutinin disease) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-agglutinin-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold agglutinin disease&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insolubility at low temperatures (eg, cryoglobulinemia) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased viscosity (eg, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deposition in tissues with resulting organ dysfunction (eg, AL [light chain] amyloidosis or the immunoglobulin deposition diseases) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathy (paraneoplastic neuropathy; eg, MGUS, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia, AL amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Accordingly, M-proteins may be part of an asymptomatic limited clonal expansion of plasma cells (eg, MGUS), be a manifestation of a malignancy (eg, myeloma, macroglobulinemia), or may lead to life-threatening complications even if the clonal expansion that produced the M-protein is limited (eg, primary amyloidosis). The clinician seeing a patient with an M-protein must therefore make the appropriate diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70820 \">table 1</a>) and initiate effective therapy in a timely manner, in order to prevent irreversible organ damage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shortening of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Interference with laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a circulating M-protein may interfere with one or more laboratory tests performed on liquid-based automated analyzers, either by precipitating during the analysis, or by virtue of its specific binding properties.</p><p>The most common artifacts are a low value for HDL cholesterol, a high value for bilirubin, as well as altered measurement of inorganic phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].

SPEP is usually done by the agarose gel method (agarose gel electrophoresis). The resulting M-protein, if found, can be quantitated using a densitometer tracing of the gel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67685%7EHEME%2F74787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67685 graphicRef74787 \">figure 2A-B</a>). Thus the SPEP serves two purposes: detect presence or absence of an M-protein in the serum, and, in conjunction with the total protein concentration, enable measurement of the concentration (&quot;size&quot;) of the M-protein. </p><p>The quantification is generally uniform across laboratories such that the size of a monoclonal spike measured at one laboratory can be compared with the size of the monoclonal spike from a different laboratory. However, this measurement can be impacted by the patient's hydration status and there is a certain degree of subjectivity in the quantification process. As such, we obtain sequential measurements from the same laboratory, whenever possible.</p><p>Capillary zone electrophoresis is an alternative and slightly more sensitive method of performing SPEP. It measures protein on-line via light absorbance techniques; protein stains are not necessary and no point of application is seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The electrophoretograms are similar to those produced with high resolution agarose gel SPEP.</p><p>In the electrophoretic methodologies (agarose or capillary zone), proteins are classified by their final position after electrophoresis is complete into five general regions: albumin, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta, and gamma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67685 \">figure 2A</a>). These regions, which also use a Greek lettering system, do <strong>not</strong> refer to the immunoglobulin class to which an M-protein may belong, and refer only to mobility through the support medium. The various immunoglobulin classes (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE) are usually located in the gamma region of the SPEP, but they may also be found in the beta-gamma and beta regions, and may occasionally extend into the alpha-2 globulin area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SPEP is indicated in all patients in whom multiple myeloma, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia, primary amyloidosis, or a related disorder is suspected. The initial SPEP should always be performed in combination with serum immunofixation in order to determine and confirm monoclonality, and to determine the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain class if an M-protein is identified.

An M-protein may be easily overlooked or an apparent M-protein may actually represent a polyclonal increase in immunoglobulins or another protein. Second, if an M-protein is present, the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain class cannot be determined from the SPEP. Consequently, the laboratory must perform serum immunofixation in order to ascertain the presence of an M-protein and to determine its type.

In traditional immunofixation, the patient's serum is electrophoresed into at least five separate lanes. Following electrophoretic separation of the serum proteins, each sample is overlaid with a different monospecific antibody, usually three for the heavy chain component and two for the light chain component (eg, anti-gamma, anti-mu, anti-alpha, anti-kappa, and anti-lambda, respectively). Precipitation of proteins (ie, the antigen-antibody complex) is allowed to occur, followed by washing (nonprecipitated proteins wash out) and staining of the remaining immunoprecipitates.</p><p>Immunosubtraction is an alternative procedure to serum immunofixation. In this procedure the serum sample is incubated with Sepharose beads coupled with anti-gamma, -alpha, -mu, -kappa, and -lambda antisera. After incubation with each of the heavy and light chain antisera, the supernatants are reanalyzed to determine which reagent(s) removed the electrophoretic abnormality. The immunosubtraction procedure is technically less demanding, is automated, and is therefore a useful alternative to serum immunofixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

However, unlike SPEP, immunofixation does not give an estimate of the size of the M-protein (ie, its serum concentration), and thus should be done in conjunction with electrophoresis. Serum immunofixation should be performed when a <strong>sharp</strong> band or peak is found in the agarose gel (ie, a monoclonal protein on SPEP) or when multiple myeloma, macroglobulinemia, primary amyloidosis, solitary or extramedullary plasmacytoma, or a related disorder is suspected, despite a normal SPEP pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Immunofixation will detect a serum M-protein at a concentration of at least 0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and a urine M-protein at a concentration of &ge;0.004 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Under such circumstances, or when primary systemic amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease are suspected, it is routine to analyze a 24-hour urine collection for the presence of free light chains.

Serum viscosity should be determined whenever the monoclonal IgM protein spike is &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or the IgA or IgG protein spike is &gt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;, section on 'Hyperviscosity syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The normal value for serum viscosity is 1.5 centipoise (CP), but hyperviscosity symptoms are rarely present unless the viscosity is &gt;4 CP. However, many laboratories report viscosity in relative terms (eg, relative to distilled water or saline). The normal relative viscosity in our laboratory is 1.8. Because of the often poor correlation between viscosity and symptoms, and the fact that relative and absolute (in centipoise, see below) viscosities of plasma are similar, these two units can be used interchangeably.</p><p>The relationship between serum viscosity and IgM protein concentration is nonlinear. Thus, with low serum IgM concentrations, an increase of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> produces only a small increase in serum viscosity, but with IgM levels of 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> an increment of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> greatly increases viscosity. In addition, the relationship between serum viscosity and symptoms of hyperviscosity is not precise. Although many patients have symptoms when the viscosity is &gt;4 centipoise (CP), most have symptoms when the viscosity reaches 6 to 7 CP. However, we have also seen higher viscosities in the absence of symptoms or physical findings of the hyperviscosity syndrome.</p><p>The specific viscosity level at which clinical symptoms occur is affected not only by the serum protein concentration but also by molecular characteristics of the protein, aggregation of protein molecules, and the simultaneous presence of diseases involving the microvasculature, hematocrit, and cardiac status. Consequently, clinical evaluation of the patient is important. The decision to perform plasmapheresis should be made on the basis of signs and symptoms of hyperviscosity rather than the viscosity value per se.

The quantity of M-protein excreted is determined by measuring the size (percent) of the M-spike in the densitometer tracing and multiplying it by the total 24-hour urinary protein excretion. The amount of protein can be expressed as <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> but it is much more useful to report the M-protein in <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours because of wide variability in the daily urinary volume. The 24-hour urine specimen requires no preservative and may be kept at room temperature during collection.</p><p>On UPEP, a urinary M-protein is seen as a dense localized band on agarose or a tall narrow peak on the densitometer tracing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55073\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55073 \">figure 7</a>). Generally, the amount of urinary monoclonal protein correlates directly with the size of the plasma cell burden, as long as renal function is relatively normal. Consequently, urinary M-protein excretion is useful in determining the response to therapy or progression of disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with a diagnosis of a plasma cell dyscrasia should have a baseline UPEP (and immunofixation) of an aliquot from a 24-hour urine collection. This test is essential to detect the presence of potentially nephrotoxic concentrations of urinary light chains. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>UPEP testing is subsequently required to detect progression and to monitor response to therapy in patients who have urinary monoclonal proteins at baseline.</p><p>UPEP (and immunofixation) has been used also as a standard screening test for patients in whom there is clinical suspicion for a monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder such as myeloma or primary amyloidosis. The serum free light chain assay can be used as an alternative method. (See <a href=\"#H2212928\" class=\"local\">'Serum free light chains'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine immunofixation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urine immunofixation is the preferred method for identification of a monoclonal protein in the urine. As in the case of serum immunofixation it is more sensitive than UPEP, and allows determination of the heavy and light chain type of the urinary monoclonal protein. It does not estimate the size of the monoclonal protein and hence is done in conjunction with UPEP. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'24-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP)'</a> above.)</p><p>The presence of a urinary monoclonal light chain on immunofixation is characterized by a discrete band with reactivity to either kappa or lambda antisera, but not both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75044\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75044 \">figure 8</a>). Two discrete bands with either kappa or lambda antisera (but not both) may be found; this is usually due to the presence of monomers and dimers of the monoclonal light chain protein. However, a discrete band with heavy chain antisera reactivity corresponding to the type of heavy chain present in the patient's serum and coinciding with one of the two light chain bands indicates the presence of a fragment of the intact immunoglobulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74774\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74774 \">figure 9</a>). This is of no particular clinical relevance.</p><p>A biclonal gammopathy with one monoclonal protein having a kappa chain and the other having a lambda chain rarely occurs. Occasionally, regularly spaced faint but discrete multiple bands are seen on immunofixation. These restricted bands represent related polyclonal free light chains and are not to be confused with monoclonal light chains. This phenomenon has been described as &quot;ladder light chain&quot; or a &quot;pseudo-oligoclonal pattern&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1965968\" class=\"local\">'Biclonal gammopathy'</a> above.)</p><p>If the patient has nephrotic syndrome, the presence of a monoclonal light chain strongly suggests either primary amyloidosis (AL) or light chain deposition disease in almost all instances. If UPEP reveals a localized globulin band and immunofixation does not demonstrate a monoclonal light chain, one should suspect the possibility of heavy chain deposition disease. Immunofixation should then be performed with antisera to IgG (gamma heavy chains). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis and light and heavy chain deposition diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Theoretically, antisera that recognize only free kappa or free lambda light chains should be used rather than antisera that recognize both free light chains as well as light chains that are part of an intact immunoglobulin. However, such antisera are often either nonspecific or insufficiently potent. In addition, a patient may have an immunoglobulin fragment that free kappa or free lambda antisera do not recognize. Thus, it is advisable to use kappa and lambda antisera that are monospecific and potent and able to recognize both free and combined light chains when performing immunofixation. This is especially important, as some patients have isolated Bence Jones proteinuria with no M-spike in the serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/29,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urine immunofixation should be performed at baseline in all patients with a diagnosis of a plasma cell dyscrasia. Immunofixation should be performed in these patients even if the routine urine analysis is negative for protein, 24-hour urine protein concentration is within normal limits, and UPEP of a concentrated urine specimen shows no globulin peak. Immunofixation is sufficiently sensitive to detect a urine M-protein of &ge;0.004 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Urine immunofixation is subsequently required to assess and document complete response in patients receiving therapy.</p><p>Urine immunofixation has also been used as a standard test for patients in whom there is clinical suspicion for a monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder such as myeloma or primary amyloidosis.

It is also essential that the laboratory know when the physician suspects primary amyloidosis or a plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/lymphocytic</span> disorder so that a greater effort can be made for the detection of an M-protein, which may be present in such a low concentration that it is not be detected by routine serum or urine protein electrophoresis, but may be detected by more sensitive techniques (eg, immunofixation or free light chain assay).</p><p>A search for monoclonal proteins should be undertaken as part of the evaluation of all patients in whom multiple myeloma, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia, primary AL (light chain) amyloidosis, or a related disorder is suspected. This evaluation should also be considered in any patient with an elevated total serum protein or otherwise unexplained signs and symptoms suggestive of the presence of a plasma cell disorder. An initial search for monoclonal proteins usually includes an SPEP, serum immunofixation, 24-hour UPEP, and urine immunofixation. Alternatively, a serum FLC assay may be used instead of the 24-hour UPEP as an initial test. This evaluation of monoclonal gammopathies is discussed separately.

The M-protein can be an intact immunoglobulin (ie, containing both heavy and light chains) or can be composed of only light chains or only heavy chains. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition of an M-protein'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of an M-protein indicates an underlying clonal plasma cell or lymphoproliferative disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70820 \">table 1</a>). M-proteins may be part of an asymptomatic limited clonal expansion of plasma cells, be a manifestation of a malignancy, or may lead to life-threatening complications even if the clonal expansion that produced the M-protein is limited. The clinician seeing a patient with a monoclonal protein must therefore make the appropriate diagnosis and initiate effective therapy in a timely manner, in order to prevent irreversible organ damage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shortening of life. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clonal size'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analysis of serum for the presence of M-proteins, or for the evaluation of a patient with increased total serum proteins, is classically performed using electrophoretic techniques, supplemented with additional tests for protein quantification and methodologies to determine whether the protein arises from a single clone (ie, monoclonal) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70590\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70590 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) separates serum proteins and allows for the detection and quantification of an M-protein in the blood. The M-protein usually presents as a single narrow peak, like a church spire, in the gamma, beta, or alpha-2 region of the densitometer tracing or as a dense, discrete band on the agarose gel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67685%7EHEME%2F74787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67685 graphicRef74787 \">figure 2A-B</a>). In contrast, a broad-based peak or band, usually of gamma mobility, suggests a polyclonal increase in immunoglobulins, most often due to an infectious, inflammatory, or reactive process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74708%7EHEME%2F74787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74708 graphicRef74787 \">figure 2B, 2D</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum immunofixation uses antibodies directed against heavy chain and light chain components to differentiate a monoclonal from a polyclonal increase in immunoglobulins and to determine the type of immunoglobulin involved (eg, IgG kappa). An M-protein is characterized on immunofixation by the combined presence of a sharp, well-defined band associated with a single heavy-chain class and a sharp and well-defined band with similar mobility characteristics which reacts with either kappa or lambda light chain antisera, but not both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55916\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55916 \">figure 4</a>). These tests do not quantify the M-protein.

This assay is more sensitive for the detection of light chains than urine immunofixation; however, results may be affected by the presence of renal failure. (See <a href=\"#H2212928\" class=\"local\">'Serum free light chains'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative immunoglobulins can detect hypogammaglobulinemia and hypergammaglobulinemia, but does not allow an assessment of monoclonality. Increased levels can be due to polyclonal or monoclonal elevations; clonality needs to be established using SPEP and immunofixation. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Quantitation of immunoglobulins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although dipsticks are used in many laboratories to screen for the presence of protein in the urine, these tests are often unable to detect Bence Jones protein (free kappa or lambda light chains).
