The procedure is usually performed as an adjunct to mid to late second trimester termination of pregnancy, but is also performed for selective or nonselective reduction of one or more fetuses in a multiple gestation. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multifetal pregnancy reduction and selective termination&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of second-trimester pregnancy termination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Facilitation of abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In theory, softening and loosening of fetal tissues and hormonal changes related to fetal demise should facilitate subsequent uterine evacuation. This has not been studied rigorously; however, the available data regarding pregnancy termination after induced fetal demise have not consistently observed a reduction in the duration of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>For patients with placenta previa undergoing medical termination of pregnancy, a case-control study including 15 pregnancies reported that preinduction feticide decreased the risk of transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This finding needs to be confirmed in larger trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient/provider preference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, standard methods of pregnancy termination via labor induction do not ensure fetal demise during the procedure. A live birth in this setting can be psychologically and emotionally difficult for the family and staff; feticide removes this possibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. In a randomized placebo controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> to facilitate late second-trimester abortion, 91 percent of patients indicated that they preferred their fetuses be dead prior to the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This has also been our experience; we have observed that patients who undergo abortion in the late second trimester are very amenable to induced fetal demise.</p><p>Providers also generally favor induced fetal demise prior to the abortion procedure, for all of the reasons cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Legal issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard methods of pregnancy termination via labor induction do not ensure fetal demise during the procedure. In many states, any birth with signs of life mandates neonatal intervention and resuscitation. Induced fetal demise prior to pregnancy termination assures stillbirth and thus avoids the possibility of resuscitation or litigation related to survival of a neonate delivered as a result of induced abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003, which defines &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; as when &quot;the person performing the abortion deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus.&quot; While &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; is not a medically recognized procedure, the procedure that is most likely affected by this legislation is the intact dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E). Feticide prior to D&amp;E assures compliance with this law.</p><p>Many physicians providing second trimester termination require induction of fetal demise prior to D&amp;E or medical abortion. Ethicists advise that this requirement is the decision of the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Third trimester abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain perception requires peripheral sensory neural tissue that senses painful stimuli, cortical pathways that transmit pain signals to the brain, and development of higher cortical functions that can interpret the pain signals. The gestational age at which neural maturation is sufficiently developed to allow the fetus to perceive pain has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. A systematic multidisciplinary review of available evidence concluded that fetal pain perception is unlikely before the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In areas where abortion is performed during the third trimester, induction of fetal demise prior to the procedure avoids the possibility that the fetus might experience pain during termination of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal medication allergy is a contraindication to induced fetal demise. There are no other absolute contraindications. The procedure requires a willing patient and skilled practitioner. Intracardiac injection requires more expertise than intraamniotic or intrafetal procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF AGENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> are the most common drugs used to induce fetal asystole. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lidocaine</a> has also been tried, but experience is limited to one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Digoxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> can be injected either intraamniotically or directly into the fetal heart or umbilical vein to induce demise. Both techniques appear to be equally effective, but intraamniotic injection is technically easier than intrafetal. A randomized trial (n = 52) comparing the two routes of administration found similar rates of fetal demise (intraamniotic: 85 percent; intrafetal: 88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Two different digoxin doses were also compared in the trial, with no significant difference in rates of fetal demise with 1.0 mg and 1.5 mg (92 and 81 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Potassium chloride</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Potassium chloride</a> (KCl) is injected into the fetal heart or umbilical vein to induce fetal death. In the largest series describing the use of KCl for feticide, 239 left ventricular injections at 17 to 24 weeks of gestation were performed with 100 percent success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. No procedure took longer than five minutes. Our experience with potassium chloride has been similarly successful and safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Three small series involving KCl injection into the umbilical vein reported success rates ranging from 87 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. In these series, no maternal electrocardiographic modifications were observed and maternal plasma potassium levels did not show any significant variation throughout the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, maternal cardiac arrest after attempted fetal intracardiac injection of potassium chloride has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Survival prior to this gestational age has not been reported. In addition, because of the fragile nature of the tissue at &lt;20 weeks, an intact D&amp;E usually cannot be performed, which obviates the need for a preprocedure fetal demise. The best obstetric estimate of gestational age is used to calculate the gestational age.</p><p>The procedure is usually performed one to two days prior to surgical abortion, usually at the patient's preoperative visit for laminaria placement. It may be performed at any time prior to medical termination of pregnancy by induction of labor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All feticide procedures are performed under continuous ultrasound visualization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracardiac injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given its higher success rate, we prefer intracardiac injection of KCI to intraamniotic injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>; this is in agreement with Society of Family Planning clinical guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Use of a 22 gauge needle minimizes patient discomfort, but is more difficult to visualize and may bend in the fetus or an obese patient and thus be more difficult to maneuver. To minimize maternal discomfort from larger gauge needles, we use a 25 gauge needle to inject 2 to 5 mL of 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> solution into the maternal abdominal wall prior to the procedure.</p><p>The spinal needle is directed into the fetal heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71131\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71131 \">image 1</a>). When the tip appears to be in the ventricle, we attempt to aspirate blood, which suggests but does not guarantee intracardiac placement. If the tip of the needle is not well-visualized, we also inject sterile saline until turbulence is seen, as turbulence at the needle tip confirms an intraventricular location. It is important to confirm correct placement as inadvertent injection into the maternal rather than the fetal compartment can produce serious adverse sequelae (see below).</p><p>After correct placement is confirmed, we inject 5 to 15 mL of KCl solution (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/mL),</span> keeping the needle in place until asystole occurs, which typically takes one to five minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72815\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72815 \">image 2</a>). KCL is usually injected in increments of 5 mL over a number of minutes. Asystole may occur abruptly, but usually takes two to three cardiac cycles. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> (1 mg) is an acceptable alternative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraumbilical vein injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Feticide can also be accomplished by injection of KCL or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> into the umbilical vein. Compared to intracardiac injection, umbilical vein injection is technically more difficult and appears to be less successful in inducing asystole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraamniotic injection of digoxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure for intraamniotic injection is similar to that for amniocentesis, except 1.0 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> is injected into the amniotic fluid after correct needle placement has been confirmed by aspiration of amniotic fluid. A 20 gauge needle is usually used, and maternal anesthesia is usually not necessary. Visualization of the fluid jet further confirms intraamniotic injection. As discussed above, this is the easiest procedure technically, but has a higher failure rate than intracardiac injection. This procedure is performed one to two days prior to the abortion, as, unlike KCl injection, asystole is not immediate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induced-fetal-demise/abstract/13,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SIDE EFFECTS AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects and complications are rare.
