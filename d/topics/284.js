The term AKI has largely replaced acute renal failure (ARF), as it more clearly defines renal dysfunction as a continuum rather than a discrete finding of failed kidney function. Pediatric AKI presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure, arises from multiple causes, and occurs in a variety of clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-in-children-clinical-features-etiology-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>].</p><p>An overview of the causes, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of AKI in children will be presented here. The prevention, management, and outcomes of AKI in children and the approach to AKI in newborns are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of acute kidney injury (acute renal failure) in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-pathogenesis-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal acute kidney injury: Pathogenesis, etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H694161131\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKI is defined as a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which traditionally is manifested by an elevated or a rise in serum creatinine from baseline. Clinically, as discussed below, the most widely used laboratory finding to make the diagnosis of AKI remains an elevated (or a rise in) serum creatinine. (See <a href=\"#H1479442760\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>However, serum creatinine is often a delayed and imprecise test as it reflects GFR in individuals at steady state with stable kidney function, and does not accurately reflect the GFR in a patient whose renal function is changing. For example, a child in the early stages of severe AKI with a markedly reduced GFR may have a relatively normal or slightly elevated creatinine, as there has not been sufficient time for creatinine accumulation. In addition, creatinine is removed by dialysis, and it is not possible to assess renal function using serum creatinine once dialysis is initiated. Furthermore, serum creatinine levels can vary with several nonrenal factors, including age, gender, muscle mass, and the nutritional and hydration status of the child. Despite these limitations, elevated or a rise in serum creatinine continues to be the most widely used laboratory finding to make the diagnosis of AKI in children. (See <a href=\"#H1479442760\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The inability of serum creatinine to accurately reflect kidney function has been especially problematic for clinical research in pediatric AKI. This has resulted in the use of more than 35 definitions of AKI in clinical studies, ranging from small changes in serum creatinine to dialysis requirement. Because of the lack of a consensus definition, comparisons among studies are difficult, resulting in a wide range of quoted epidemiology, morbidity, and mortality rates in the AKI pediatric literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-in-children-clinical-features-etiology-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Standardized definitions for pediatric AKI include the Pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (pRIFLE), AKI Network (AKIN), and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. It is recommended that the KDIGO AKI definition and staging be used to guide clinical care based on consensus of pediatric nephrology experts following a systematic review of the literature. (See <a href=\"#H1842240189\" class=\"local\">'KDIGO AKI definition'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H694161441\"><span class=\"h2\">pRIFLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>pRIFLE is a pediatric modification of the adult RIFLE classification and consists of three graded levels of injury (Risk, Injury, and Failure) based upon the magnitude of change in estimated GFR (eg, changes in serum creatinine) or urine output, and two outcome measures (Loss of kidney function and End-stage renal disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68721 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-in-children-clinical-features-etiology-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This modification takes into account the expected normal changes in serum creatinine concentrations that accompany somatic growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of chronic kidney disease in children&quot;, section on 'Serum creatinine and GFR'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate placement of any child with an estimated creatinine clearance &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> into the &quot;pRIFLE-F&quot; category (ie, kidney failure class), instead of waiting for the serum creatinine concentration to reach 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> as proposed by the original &quot;RIFLE-F&quot; staging. As an example, in infants and toddlers, a serum creatinine as low as 1 may reflect an estimated creatinine clearance &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, indicating renal failure.</p><p/><p>The use of pRIFLE has been strongly advocated as a research and clinical tool as many experts in the field believe that it will improve the understanding of the epidemiology and outcomes of pediatric AKI. Support of pRIFLE is based on several reports that demonstrated AKI defined by the pRIFLE criteria was an independent risk factor for mortality and morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-in-children-clinical-features-etiology-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>].

Severe AKI was associated with an increased risk of death by day 28 after adjustment of confounding variables (eg, primary diagnosis, coexisting conditions at baseline, mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive therapy). In addition, stepwise increases in severity of AKI were associated with incremental increases in the risk of death. Severe AKI was associated with increased use of mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. This study also utilized <strong>both</strong> serum creatinine and urine output criteria to diagnose AKI in critically ill children (factors used in defining adult AKI). Over 67 percent of the children found to have AKI by oliguria would have been missed if using serum creatinine criteria alone. Furthermore, there was an increase in mortality when KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI was reached based on oliguria versus serum creatinine change (7.8 versus 2.9 percent). These data reinforce the need to identify patients at-risk for AKI or with mild AKI using both serum creatinine and urine output criteria similar to the adult criteria for AKI, so that early interventions can be given to prevent further injury.

This schema is helpful for understanding the underlying pathophysiology and outlining a management approach.

It is the most common form of pediatric AKI and is due to hypovolemia (bleeding or gastrointestinal, urinary or cutaneous losses), or reduction of effective circulation (eg, heart failure, septic shock, and cirrhosis). In this form of AKI, although glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is reduced, renal tubular function remains intact with avid reabsorption of sodium and water in response to renal hypoperfusion, leading to oliguria. When normal renal perfusion is restored, urine flow and GFR usually return to normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrinsic renal disease &ndash; Intrinsic or intrarenal AKI is characterized by structural damage to the renal parenchyma. The most common causes of intrinsic disease are prolonged hypoperfusion, sepsis, nephrotoxins, or severe glomerular diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postrenal disease &ndash; Postrenal or obstructive AKI is typically the result of congenital or acquired anatomic obstructions to the lower urinary tract.</p><p/><p>Although less frequently used, AKI may also be classified by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical setting or circumstance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Community-acquired<em> </em>AKI is more likely to be associated with a single predominant insult, most commonly volume depletion, and is frequently reversible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hospital-acquired AKI, especially in the critical care setting, is frequently multifactorial and often part of a more extensive multiorgan failure. This form of AKI often accompanies other organ disease processes and markedly complicates patient management and outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine output &ndash; Measurement of urine output is especially useful in the critical care setting, since the degree of oliguria affects fluid and electrolyte management.

Interruption of perfusion to the kidneys results in prerenal AKI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomeruli &ndash; Ultrafiltration occurs at the glomeruli forming an ultrafiltrate, which subsequently flows into the renal tubules.

What is clinically important is whether there is a reduction of GFR due to renal injury, which is reflected by an increase in serum creatinine.</p><p>As a result, in most settings, an elevated creatinine is used to make the diagnosis of AKI. However, an initial creatinine level may not be helpful as baseline creatinine levels are unknown in the majority of children, and normal serum creatinine levels vary depending on the age, gender, muscle mass, and the nutritional and hydration status of the child.</p><p>The following are the ranges of normal serum creatinine values by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-in-children-clinical-features-etiology-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborn &ndash; 0.3 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (27 to 88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infant &ndash; 0.2 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (18 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Child &ndash; 0.3 to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (27 to 62 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescent &ndash; 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (44 to 88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p/><p>Because of the wide range of normal serum creatinine, an initial value of 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (35 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> may be normal or elevated in an infant or young child.

The change in creatinine is dependent on the amount of residual renal function, the endogenous production of creatinine based on muscle mass, and the volume of distribution. In some settings, the serum creatinine may not rise until there is a 50 percent or more reduction in GFR.</p><p>Despite these limitations, there is currently no better laboratory test to make the diagnosis of AKI in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1562454701\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinalysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An abnormal urinalysis provides supportive diagnostic evidence for AKI. However, in patients with prerenal AKI, the urinalysis may be normal. In contrast, patients with intrinsic AKI, particularly those with glomerular disease or acute tubular necrosis, commonly will have hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria. Thus, a normal urinalysis does not preclude the diagnosis of AKI.</p><p>Urinalysis is often helpful in identifying the underlying cause of AKI as discussed below.

Novel biomarkers, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) show promise in both their diagnostic and prognostic utility in the setting of AKI, and may allow for early intervention prior to the onset of serum creatinine rise, severe metabolic derangements, and fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-in-children-clinical-features-etiology-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,4,58-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,58-62</a>]. However, future studies are needed to establish whether any of these markers will provide beneficial clinical guidance in the diagnosis and management of AKI in children.

The distinction between these two forms of renal disease is based on disease duration. The disease process in patients with AKI generally resolves over days and weeks, whereas those with CKD will have persistent renal dysfunction for months to years. As an example, children with AKI due to acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) and those with CKD due to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) may both present acutely with edema, hematuria, hypertension, and hypocomplementemia. In patients with PSGN, symptoms generally resolve and the C3 level returns to normal by four to six weeks. In contrast, those with MPGN continue to have persistent signs of nephritis and hypocomplementemia beyond two months.

For example, children with CKD may have impaired growth or a history of chronic hypertension. In addition, renal ultrasound may be helpful as kidneys in patients with CKD are frequently small due to nephron loss or congenital hypoplasia, whereas the kidneys in patients with AKI are normal in size or enlarged (due to inflammation or edema).

It can document the presence of one or two kidneys, delineate renal size, and survey the renal parenchyma. It is also particularly helpful in diagnosing urinary tract obstruction or occlusion of the major renal vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic assessment of renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, renal ultrasound may be useful in differentiating AKI from chronic kidney disease (CKD). Typically, the kidneys in AKI are normal in size or enlarged (due to inflammation or edema), with increased echogenicity, whereas those in CKD are frequently small and shrunken.

In pediatric AKI, it is most commonly indicated to help guide treatment in patients with suspected acute glomerulonephritis (to identify crescentic forms or specific vasculitides) or suspected lupus nephritis (to classify the disease and establish the activity and chronicity).

However, in developed countries, the incidence of pediatric AKI is rising, primarily due to the increased use of intensive and advanced technology for children with chronic conditions or those who are critically ill.
