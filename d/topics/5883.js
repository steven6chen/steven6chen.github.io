Egg allergies are immunologic responses to proteins in foods and include immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody-mediated allergy as well as other allergic syndromes, such as atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Cross-reactivity between chicken egg and meat and between eggs of various birds is briefly discussed. Issues with egg-containing vaccines and lipid emulsions are also covered in this topic, although options for administration of the influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of egg allergy are also discussed separately.

However, this vaccination is required for travelers entering several countries in endemic areas. In a small study, a reduced intradermal dose of the yellow fever vaccine induced protective antibody responses in egg-allergic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-travel#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for travel&quot;, section on 'Yellow fever vaccine'</a>.)</p><p>The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is NOT contraindicated for egg allergic children, although the measles vaccine is produced in a culture of chick embryo fibroblasts. Three large trials have demonstrated the safety of the MMR vaccine in egg-allergic children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Allergic reactions to these vaccines have been primarily attributed to the gelatin component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Two other areas of concern are lipid emulsions that contain egg (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and intralipid) and use of egg lysozyme, an enzyme found in egg white, in pharmaceutical products. There are case reports of anaphylaxis to these products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>In the largest report to date of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> use in children with egg allergies, 27 of 28 egg-allergic children received propofol without adverse effects, including one child who had a history of anaphylaxis to egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One allergic reaction was reported in a child with a history of anaphylaxis to egg and multiple food allergies who developed generalized erythema and urticaria after propofol administration, without respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. In this child, a skin prick test (SPT) with undiluted propofol performed three months after the reaction resulted in a small 3 mm wheal. Thus, propofol is likely to be tolerated by most egg-allergic children who do not have a history of anaphylaxis to egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>There are no guidelines on how to approach administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> in those with egg allergy, and data are limited. In addition, skin testing for propofol is not standardized, and, therefore, clinical utility of skin testing is uncertain. Typically, propofol is administered by personnel able to recognize and promptly treat anaphylaxis and under conditions of careful monitoring. We suggest administration of propofol in a routine manner for those without a history of anaphylaxis to egg. For patients who have a history of anaphylaxis to egg, options include selection of another agent, starting with a test dose of propofol and then proceeding to the treatment dose, or simply proceeding with caution, depending upon clinical judgment.</p><p>Data regarding hypersensitivity to intravenous fat emulsions are limited to only a few case reports, but confirmatory testing for egg allergy was documented in only one pediatric case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This two-year-old child experienced diffuse pruritus without urticaria on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of administration. Since alternative preparations of intralipids without egg are not available and reactions are uncommon, intralipids can be given to individuals with egg allergy of any severity if clinically indicated.

It requires instructions on avoidance and education about treatment of reactions in the event of accidental exposure. It also includes monitoring for the resolution of the allergy.</p><p>The management of food allergy in the specific settings of schools and camps is discussed in detail separately.

Eliminating egg (both egg white and egg yolk) from the diet can be difficult and can pose nutritional as well as quality-of-life concerns since egg is a ubiquitous food. Egg is an ingredient in baked goods, breaded foods, cream fillings, custards, candies, canned soups, casseroles, frostings, ice creams, lollipops, marshmallows, marzipan, pastas, salad dressings, and meat-based dishes such as meatballs or meatloaf (<a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/file/tips-avoid-allergen.pdf&amp;token=oN6rXOmeBLkIpfIsq5mH5Vubaw4fI+8XYYiBro3ggBQ5hJlAba9Lqx6Ggg3lDfTyNE3jlOaI+lgbIsX7Coa/Rw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2390\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Food Allergy Research and Education [FARE]</a> and <a href=\"https://web.emmes.com/study/cofar/EGGAvoidance.pdf&amp;token=61D79h4FlocEgxiAXo/xoo0cl6Je4x6DO0xHKKODzLFeoIH77SM8pgqpzFAPB95QLnW37a7670H/X2cCPrO26Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2390\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Consortium of Food Allergy Research [CoFAR] sheet on egg</a>). Accidental exposures are common. In one prospective series of 500 infants aged 3 to 15 months with suspected or confirmed egg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> milk allergy, 72 percent had an allergic reaction, most commonly to milk, egg, or peanut, during a three-year period, with an annualized reaction rate of 0.81 per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Twenty-one percent of these were triggered by egg, giving an annualized rate of reaction to egg of 0.17 per year. Eighty-seven percent of all reactions were due to accidental exposures.

This can happen anywhere food is served, including restaurants and bakeries. In addition, egg whites and shells are used as clarifying agents and can be found in soup stocks, consomm&eacute;s, wine, alcohol-based beverages, and coffee drinks. Egg white is also used as a wash to make bread products shiny.

Legislation has been enacted in the United States mandating that the ingredients labels on food packages clearly identify the presence of eight specified allergenic foods, including egg (as well as milk, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, fish, and crustacean shellfish) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Patients should ensure that the clinicians and pharmacists caring for them are aware of their egg allergy, especially before receiving any new medication or vaccine. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever-vaccine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">yellow fever vaccine</a> may induce reactions in egg-allergic individuals. Protocols are available for the safe administration of this vaccine in egg-allergic individuals. In contrast, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and influenza vaccine are well tolerated by egg-allergic individuals and should be administered in the routine manner. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Egg-containing vaccines and lipid emulsions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;, section on 'Food allergens in nonfood items'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influenza vaccination in individuals with egg allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175084098\"><span class=\"h3\">Extensively heated egg</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have indicated that 66 to 88 percent of individuals with egg allergy can tolerate extensively heated or baked forms of egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. The potential benefits of including extensively heated egg in the diet, if tolerated, extend beyond improvements in quality of life. Data suggest that tolerance to extensively heated egg is a good prognostic factor for the development of tolerance to less heated forms of egg and that including extensively heated egg in the diet may accelerate the development of tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, consumption of extensively heated egg may also increase the risk of a reaction due to inconsistencies in the amount of egg in baked products leading to a greater exposure or due to incomplete cooking leading to exposure to lightly cooked egg. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical scenarios'</a> below.)</p><p>While there is some variation in the predictive value of skin prick tests (SPTs) with hen's egg extract and specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, the data indicate that there is a &gt;80 percent chance that baked egg will be tolerated if egg-specific IgE is &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L,</span> whereas a level &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L</span> suggests an increased likelihood of reacting to baked egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Prick-prick testing with the challenge food was informative in one study, with 100 percent negative predictive values when mean wheal diameters were &lt;3 mm for three different forms of extensively heated egg (cake, frittata, and boiled egg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This suggests that these patients could introduce extensively heated egg without first undergoing an oral food challenge (OFC).</p><p>However, 12 to 18 percent of those who reacted during baked egg challenge had multisystem involvement requiring treatment with intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In addition, prick-prick testing with the food is not standardized. The utility of measurement of specific IgE to egg components (ovomucoid, ovalbumin) has also not been extensively studied, and results have not consistently correlated with clinical outcomes. Thus, until further data are available, supervised OFCs are recommended to determine whether an individual with egg allergy can safely include extensively heated egg in their diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=component-testing-for-animal-derived-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Component testing for animal-derived food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following studies are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 117 children with a history of egg allergy, 70 percent of the children who were reactive to egg were tolerant to baked egg. Those who were tolerant to baked egg had lower SPT wheal sizes (median 6 versus 8 mm) and lower egg-specific IgE levels (median 1.3 versus 5.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L)</span> compared with those who reacted to baked egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Similarly, in a report of 100 consecutive open food challenges, 66 percent of children with egg allergy were able to tolerate baked egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Those tolerating baked egg had a lower median egg-specific IgE level compared with children who reacted to baked egg (median 2.81 versus 5.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kUA/L)</span>. However, there was no difference in SPT wheal size (median of 7 mm for both groups).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study examined the outcomes of open food challenges to baked egg in 52 children with egg allergy. In this study, neither SPT or egg-specific IgE level was statistically different between groups (median specific IgE 2.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">kU/L</span> and SPT 12 mm wheal for those who passed baked egg challenge versus 1.52 <span class=\"nowrap\">kU/L</span> and 17 mm for those who reacted) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third study, 54 children with a history of egg allergy and positive skin test to raw hen's egg were skin tested (prick-prick method) to three different forms of extensively heated egg: baked egg in a wheat matrix in the form of a cake that was baked at 180&deg;C (356&deg;F) for at least 30 minutes, baked egg without a wheat matrix in the form of a single egg frittata fried in olive oil for three minutes and then cooked in a 180&deg;C oven for at least 30 minutes, and egg boiled for 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. All children were then challenged to the cake, regardless of skin test results. Those who passed the cake OFC were sequential challenged to the frittata and then, if that OFC was passed, to the boiled egg. OFC pass rates were 88 percent for the cake, 74 percent for the frittata, and 56 percent for the boiled egg. The similarity in OFC pass rates for the cake and frittata suggests that the cooking temperature, cooking time, and final internal temperature of the food are more important than the presence of a wheat matrix. In addition, as discussed above, prick-prick testing with the different forms of extensively heated egg were found to have a high negative predictive value.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical scenarios</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following scenarios illustrate some of the issues involved and our management approach. Individual clinicians may decide to adopt different strategies depending upon their level of expertise and the resources available (eg, ability to perform OFCs).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient with an allergy to egg in any or all forms or of any severity wishes to avoid all egg, we do not discourage this approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We allow persons to continue to eat egg in more processed forms than what triggered their reaction(s) if they have eaten egg in these forms regularly and in the recent past (similar to passing an OFC). In most cases, this involves patients who reacted to lightly cooked egg (eg, scrambled egg, French toast), but have a history of tolerating extensively heated egg (eg, muffins, waffles). We generally suggest that these patients avoid more intermediate forms of cooked egg, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">meatballs/meatloaf,</span> breaded foods, casseroles, custard, mayonnaise, and hard-boiled egg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One caveat to this approach that should be discussed with patients is that it is possible that a patient may have a reaction due to ingestion of a larger amount of egg or more lightly cooked egg than usual (eg, normally tolerates egg in muffins, but has a reaction when blueberries are used in the muffins and the batter does not cook completely around the blueberries).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that patients who have reacted to intermediately cooked or extensively heated egg avoid all forms of egg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An oral challenge to extensively heated egg may be performed by an allergy specialist if a patient is not currently eating egg in this form but the patient (or parents of the patient) wishes to introduce it into the diet.

As with other forms of food allergy, the severity of symptoms in a given individual with egg allergy may vary considerably between reactions. In addition, the severity of an initial reaction does not predict the severity of subsequent reactions.
