These &quot;mothers&quot; may be represented by as many as three different individuals.</p><p>A &ldquo;gestational&rdquo; surrogate is a woman who agrees to carry a pregnancy for another woman (intended mother). The intended mother provides the egg and the intended father provides the sperm; rarely, egg donors or sperm donors are involved. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is used to create an embryo, which is transferred into the uterus of the gestational surrogate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The gestational surrogate has no genetic connection to the embryo. </p><p>By comparison, a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; surrogate typically has a genetic connection to the embryo. The surrogate's own egg is fertilized by intrauterine insemination (IUI) of sperm from the intended father (or a sperm donor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Therefore, the surrogate has a genetic, as well as a gestational, connection to the embryo. </p><p>The role of surrogates is usually limited to carrying the pregnancy and delivery of the infant; it does not extend to the raising of the child (social mother). However, gestational and traditional surrogates may be family members, and thus may maintain familial contact with the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review issues related to gestational surrogate pregnancy. Many of these issues also apply to traditional surrogacy.</p><p>In 2009, gestational surrogates were used in 1 percent of assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles using fresh nondonor embryos in the United States (883 cycles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In countries that allow surrogacy, acceptable indications for the use of a gestational surrogate vary. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine states that gestational carriers may be used when a true medical condition precludes the intended parent from carrying a pregnancy or would pose a significant risk of death or harm to the woman or the fetus. The indication must be clearly documented in the patient's medical record. Examples of such medical indications would include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of uterus (congenital or acquired)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant uterine anomaly (eg, irreparable Asherman syndrome; unicornuate uterus associated with recurrent pregnancy loss)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absolute medical contraindication to pregnancy (eg, pulmonary hypertension)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious medical condition that could be exacerbated by pregnancy or cause significant risk to the fetus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biologic inability to conceive or bear a child, such as single male or homosexual male couple.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an unidentified endometrial factor exists, such as for patients with multiple unexplained previous IVF failures despite transfer of good-quality embryos.</p><p/><p>The guideline further states that no owner, operator, laboratory director, or employee of the practice may serve as a carrier or intended parent in that practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonfunctioning uterus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absence of a functional uterus may result from congenital or acquired abnormalities (eg, Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, hysterectomy for benign or malignant disease, Asherman syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. However, some of these women may also have ovarian abnormalities or decreased ovarian reserve, which may limit their ability to provide an egg. In these situations, an egg donor or surrogate can be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of congenital uterine anomalies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-adhesions-clinical-manifestation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine adhesions: Clinical manifestation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women with absolute uterine factor infertility, uterus transplantation is an experimental procedure that is a potential alternative to surrogate use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Potential candidates include women who want to experience pregnancy or who do not have access (legal or financial) to a surrogate. This technique is only performed as part of an investigational protocol and is not yet routinely available.

For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with poor cardiac or renal function may experience irreversible deterioration during pregnancy. Pregnancy in women with Eisenmenger syndrome is associated with maternal mortality of 30 to 50 percent.

Cancers that express estrogen receptors may be stimulated during ovulation induction or pregnancy; thus, it may be desirable to avoid these processes in affected women.

Consequently, the fetus is at risk of developing long-term severe sequelae of prematurity. Severe preeclampsia is also associated with increased maternal morbidity, and rarely mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>(See additional individual topic reviews on specific medical disorders that may complicate pregnancy.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic inability to conceive or bear a child</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL) or IVF implantation failures may consider use of a gestational surrogate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Women who decide to pursue this route should undergo a thorough evaluation as to the etiology of the RPL or failed IVF. If RPL or recurrent IVF failure is a result of aneuploidy, then one might consider a donor egg IVF cycle with or without a donor sperm prior to embarking on a gestational surrogate approach to pregnancy.</p><p>Poor pregnancy outcome is another potential indication for using a gestational surrogate. As an example, one report described a 29-year-old woman with three consecutive pregnancies complicated by early onset severe preeclampsia causing fetal demise at 22 and 24 weeks of gestation, a neonatal death at 25 weeks of gestation, and life-threatening maternal hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. An IVF procedure was performed using the woman's eggs and her husband's sperm, and two embryos were transferred into the uterus of a friend who offered to be a gestational surrogate. The pregnancy progressed without complications to delivery of a healthy 3.2-kg infant at 39 weeks of gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21643390\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL MANAGEMENT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed description of the medical management and psychological evaluation of gestational surrogates and intended parent(s) can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.asrm.org/news-and-publications/practice-committee-documents/&amp;token=JPzBlapreaTGJ3FMiBirU80eKx43aNpfcmHsGu4n4yKDS9+Y+fGoDjxd7S2CXLbtd572SCPkTjgQVfchLodyAEGKJKaZiFH0iKHZbVUq72o=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7431\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Society for Reproductive Medicine</a> web site. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1491496531\"><span class=\"h1\">FINDING A GESTATIONAL SURROGATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gestational surrogates are recruited through advertisements by the couple's attorney, by independent recruiters, by the IVF program, or by the couple themselves using personal contacts and the media. This can take several months, or more. In the US, at least one state requires that the gestational surrogate be related to one of the intended parents.</p><p>In one study in which gestational surrogates were evaluated by psychodiagnostic interview and by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Interview-2, gestational surrogates were motivated by a wish to help an infertile couple, enjoyed being pregnant, showed narcissistic needs, and expressed a wish for secondary financial gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The majority considered becoming a traditional surrogate, but felt they could not surrender a child that was genetically theirs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF A GESTATIONAL SURROGATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no universal guidelines regarding criteria for choosing a gestational surrogate, but several factors need to be considered in selection of the surrogate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Obviously, review of the potential gestational surrogate's obstetrical and general medical history is important to select women at low risk of pregnancy complications. A successful obstetrical history is predictive of favorable gestational outcomes for the intended parents. As an example, a history of preterm birth is the strongest risk factor for recurrent preterm birth, although most women who have had a preterm birth will have subsequent pregnancies of a normal duration. We use gestational surrogates that have a history of at least one uncomplicated pregnancy (eg, no preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth) and no chronic medical conditions, with the exception of adequately treated hypothyroidism.</p><p>Some programs restrict selection of gestational surrogates to women who have only had vaginal births; others allow women with one prior cesarean delivery to become a gestational surrogate.</p><p>A young maternal age is desirable since advancing age may have deleterious effects on the uterus, which render it a less favorable environment for pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, older women are more likely to have uterine leiomyoma or endometrial scarring from previous surgical procedures. They may also have reduced uterine artery blood flow or endometrial receptivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]; however, these factors appear to play no more than a minor role compared to ovarian aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Societal and cultural beliefs or legal regulations may preclude use of gestational surrogates who are of a different race than the intended parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The emotional well-being of the gestational surrogate is important since she must be emotionally prepared to give the newborn child to the intended parents upon delivery. The range of emotions associated with the delivery and transfer of the infant to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> intended parents is unpredictable. Both biological and nonbiological factors play a role in defining the relationship between a parent and a child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. A thorough review of the potential gestational surrogate's religious, moral, and ethical views with regard to this process increases the likelihood that transfer of the newborn to the intended parents will proceed smoothly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>The use of familial members for gestational surrogacy raises unique relationship considerations. Given the inherent long-term relationship between a family member and the intended parent, the association continues well beyond the delivery of the child. This raises social and psychological concerns that need to be properly discussed prior to embarking on use of a family-member for surrogacy. Relationships need to be addressed on at least three levels: (i) the potential surrogate and the rest of the family; (ii) the surrogate and the intended parent; (iii) the surrogate and the child. Given varying family dynamics, one might anticipate and evaluate for undue familial pressure on the potential surrogate to consent to surrogacy. During pregnancy, specific guidelines must be predetermined for the interaction and regulation of the intended parent with the surrogate. As a family member, these interactions may be significantly different since lifestyle patterns of the surrogate are much more familiar to the intended parent, who might attempt to regulate activity beyond the level of traditional intended parent-surrogate agreements. Finally, following delivery, will the relationship between the child and their biological relative be altered in any manner due to the unique involvement as a surrogate? The Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology guidelines suggest psychological screening for all women involved in third party reproduction and more so with specific focus on these areas for familial surrogates.</p><p>Laboratory screening is also performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The gestational surrogate is tested for HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, varicella and rubella titers, and CMV to minimize the chance of transmitting disease to the fetus. Blood type and Rh factor are also performed. Cervical cytology and urine drug screen should be normal. Under the guidelines of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, the potential surrogate should have a physician evaluation, evaluation of the uterine cavity, and be in excellent physical health. She should not use tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs. </p><p>The gestational surrogate&rsquo;s partner, if there is one, must also consent to infectious disease (gonorrhea, chlamydia, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, CMV) and psychological screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRACTUAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An expert team of healthcare providers, counselors, and attorneys should be involved in drafting the agreement between the gestational surrogate and the intended parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/23-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-33</a>]. Both the gestational surrogate and the intended parents should be represented by an attorney, even if the gestational surrogate is a family member. While it is impossible to anticipate every possible scenario, it is prudent to have extensive discussion and clear statements of intent prior to embarking on this route.</p><p>The expectations of both parties during the gestational process and immediately following delivery should be determined before any assisted reproductive technology is applied. Individual state law governs to what extent, if any, the intended parent may influence actions and behaviors of the gestational surrogate that might impact the pregnancy. As an example, the intended parents may not want the gestational surrogate to smoke during the course of the pregnancy. They may facilitate this intervention by paying for treatment for smoking cessation. However, the intended parents may not be able to require the gestational surrogate to engage in a smoking cessation program.</p><p>Another important issue is how the parties will resolve issues relating to prenatal diagnosis. Who has the authority to make decisions about terminating the pregnancy if a fetal abnormality is diagnosed? What are the legal rights of a gestational surrogate if she wants to continue the pregnancy when the intended parents choose to terminate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]?</p><p>When is the gestational surrogate's obligation to the intended parents fulfilled? Following delivery, the intended parents may want the gestational surrogate to provide breast milk or breastfeed the newborn. These postpartum issues should be addressed contractually.</p><p>Financial remuneration also needs to be determined. What is the appropriate compensation for the gestational surrogate and what expected and unexpected expenses will be covered by the intended parents? Expenses may involve medical, housing, transportation, legal, or health insurance bills. Generally, relatives are not financially compensated by those for whom they carry a pregnancy. For gestational surrogates that are not relatives or friends, the amount of remuneration varies depending on the chosen surrogate, legal fees, geographic region, and agencies involved. When the gestational surrogate has been recruited by the couple's attorney, by independent recruiters, or by IVF programs themselves, these entities have vested financial interests in pairing a gestational surrogate with the intended parent. </p><p>Finally, what role, if any, will the gestational surrogate assume in the event of the untimely demise of an intended parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]? This is more than a theoretical issue for gestational surrogates for women with serious medical disorders. When the gestational surrogate does not have any biological relationship to the child, counseling and legal consultation should review the legal implications and obligations of the intended parent and carrier towards the child based on the specific state's laws.</p><p>We recommend that couples considering use of a gestational surrogate consult with an attorney with expertise in third party reproduction. The laws of the state in which the gestational surrogate delivers determine whether the contracting couple or the gestational surrogate will be the legal parent at the time of delivery. In some states, prebirth adoption is possible, while in others, legal documents created prior to birth can result in the intended parents' names being legally placed on the birth certificate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is vital that these policies be clear to the intended parents and gestational surrogate prior to embarking on pregnancy.</p><p>The Committee on Ethics of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has published a Committee Opinion on Surrogate Motherhood that reviews these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTECTION OF GESTATIONAL SURROGATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines are be in place to protect the health and ensure the safety of the gestational surrogate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/5,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,36,37</a>]. Testing for infectious disease is required for the genetic parents, as well as the gestational carrier, in order to protect the gestational carrier from possible infection that could be transmitted via an embryo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F99740\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99740 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, HIV infected couples have requested use of a gestational surrogate. Although there are no definitive data that gametes can transmit HIV to the embryo and, in turn, to the gestational surrogate, the theoretical risk of transmitting infection to the gestational surrogate has been ascertained as an unacceptable infectious health risk, and such requests have been denied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, the Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) defined the rights of the gestational carrier as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational carriers have a right to be fully informed of the risks of the surrogacy process and of pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational carriers should receive psychological evaluation and counseling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational carriers should have independent legal counsel</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of reasonable economic compensation to the gestational carrier is ethical</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intended parents are the psychosocial parents of any children born by a gestational carrier</p><p/><p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations require the performance of a broad panel of infectious disease screening tests for both intended parents prior to transfer of embryos into a gestational surrogate, and any abnormal test results must be fully disclosed to the gestational surrogate prior to embryo transfer. These screening tests are the same as those performed on the gestational surrogate. These tests are performed before initiation of each fertility treatment cycle. The gestational surrogate may refuse the embryo transfer if parental tests for infection reveal positive results. </p><p>There is no clear evidence that women with poor obstetrical histories transfer these obstetrical risks to their gestational surrogate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The few cases of obstetrical complications in gestational surrogates reported in the literature do not appear to be above the baseline rate for the general obstetrical population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, there is a paucity of studies examining this issue and further investigation is necessary.</p><p>In some cases, obstetrical complications may have been related to preexisting conditions in the gestational surrogate. Thus, it is important to thoroughly review the prior medical and obstetrical history of gestational surrogate candidates, as with any woman seeking preconception counseling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-preconception-office-visit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The preconception office visit&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1570951720\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications are used to synchronize the menstrual cycles of both the gestational surrogate and the intended mother. The intended mother uses fertility medication to stimulate the development of eggs (unless an egg donor is used). The gestational surrogate takes medication to prepare her uterus for pregnancy. At the appropriate time, the eggs are removed from the intended mother (or independent egg donor) and fertilized in vitro with her partner&rsquo;s sperm (or with donor sperm). The cultured embryos are then transferred into the uterus of the gestational surrogate. Cryopreserved embryos can also be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The live birth rate of gestational surrogates is as high or higher than that in age matched controls undergoing routine IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/1,2,7,12,13,16,42-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7,12,13,16,42-48</a>]. A possible explanation of the higher success rates is that the gestational surrogate may be younger than the intended mother and thus may provide a more favorable uterine environment. Another reason is that infertile couples appear to have a higher rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to normal fertile couples. Thus, pregnancies in gestational surrogates may be more comparable to those in the general obstetrical population than those in the infertility population undergoing IVF.</p><p>A retrospective analysis of data from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART) compared obstetric outcome for gestational surrogate pregnancies, pregnancies in couples undergoing IVF with their own gametes, and pregnancies conceived using donor eggs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Infants of gestational surrogate pregnancies had higher mean birthweight than infants from the other two groups (3309 versus 3236 to 3265 grams), but slightly lower mean gestational age at birth (37.2 weeks versus 37.4 weeks in donor egg pregnancies and 37.7 weeks in IVF pregnancies). The higher birthweight in gestational surrogate pregnancies may reflect the proven uterine environment and absence of infertility-related disorders in these women. The slightly lower gestational age at birth in gestational surrogates and donor egg pregnancies is unexplained.</p><p>Although data are limited, it appears that psychological well-being, parenting, and child development in families created by surrogacy are at least as good as natural conception families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In addition, family relationships within the surrogate's own family appear to be good and her children do not appear to be negatively affected by their mother's decision to be a surrogate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surrogate-pregnancy/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2163811206\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
