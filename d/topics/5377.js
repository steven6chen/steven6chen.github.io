Although there is a wide variation in outcomes among centers, data from the United States indicate that overall one-year unadjusted survival of a renal allograft is approximately 89 percent for a deceased-donor kidney and approximately 95 percent for a living-donor kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prompt recognition and evaluation of allograft dysfunction is vital, as it is usually reversible. Persistent dysfunction without timely intervention may lead to irreversible loss of allograft function and, eventually, allograft failure.</p><p>A number of risk factors have been identified for lower one-year deceased-donor renal allograft survival. These include prior sensitization with &gt;50 percent panel reactivity, the presence of delayed graft function (DGF; defined as the requirement for dialysis during the first week after transplantation), the number and severity of rejection episodes, second or third transplant, donor age &lt;5 or &gt;60 years, greater degrees of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatching, and allograft dysfunction at discharge (plasma creatinine concentration &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [176 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span>.</p><p>The causes of renal allograft dysfunction vary with the time (usually classified as immediate, early, and late period) after transplantation.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the evaluation and diagnosis of renal allograft dysfunction among patients who have undergone kidney transplantation. The classification, diagnosis, and treatment of acute renal allograft rejection, chronic renal allograft nephropathy, and BK virus-induced (polyomavirus-induced) nephropathy are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

We define <strong>acute</strong> renal allograft dysfunction as one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in serum creatinine of &ge;25 percent from baseline within a one-to-three-month time period</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of the serum creatinine to decrease following transplantation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteinuria &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span></p><p/><p><strong>Delayed graft function</strong> (DGF) is defined as the need for dialysis within the first week after transplantation. The incidence is markedly higher among patients who receive kidneys from donors with a Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) of &gt;85 percent compared with standard-donor kidneys (ie, KDPI of &lt;85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This most likely reflects inherent donor disease, with a predisposition to atherosclerosis and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). In addition, DGF occurs more commonly among recipients of deceased-donor transplants compared with living-donor transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p><strong>Chronic</strong> renal allograft dysfunction is defined as a condition in which irreversible damage to the kidney allograft occurs over a period of weeks to months. The major determinant of chronic renal allograft dysfunction is the development of chronic allograft nephropathy (also called interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/tubular</span> atrophy [IFTA]), which is related to a variety of causes such as donor factors, ischemia-reperfusion injury, repeated episodes of acute dysfunction, subclinical rejection, calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, and hypertensive disease. On a biopsy, there is usually interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and glomerulosclerosis. It is a precursor to the majority of graft failures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The terms chronic rejection, chronic renal allograft dysfunction, and IFTA have been used interchangeably and inconsistently in the literature. This is further complicated by the use of the term &quot;transplant glomerulopathy&quot;. The confusion occurs because the terms sometimes refer to a chronological event, but the histologic findings of chronicity, such as IFTA, which can result from a variety of immune- and nonimmune-mediated events, and transplant glomerulopathy, which is felt to result from antibody-mediated injury in the majority of cases, can occur acutely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1859156585\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF RENAL ALLOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of renal allograft dysfunction depends upon the timing of presentation. A diagnosis can be established in most patients by means of thorough history and physical examination, laboratory and imaging studies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a renal allograft biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1286090283\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with allograft dysfunction immediately (&lt;1 week) posttransplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop renal allograft dysfunction within the first week posttransplant most commonly present with low urine output or failure of the serum creatinine to decrease after transplantation. Some patients (ie, those with delayed graft function) may require dialysis in the first week after transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H39248220\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>An understanding of the patient&rsquo;s daily urine output prior to transplantation is important when interpreting urine output in the immediate posttransplant setting. Patients who were previously on dialysis may have low or no daily urine output at baseline and therefore, urine output after transplant will continue to be low or fail to increase in those with allograft dysfunction. By contrast, patients who receive a renal transplant before initiating dialysis are likely to have higher (and even normal) daily urine output at baseline. In such patients with urine output from their native kidneys, allograft dysfunction is more likely to manifest as failure of the serum creatinine to decrease posttransplant. However, a significant increase in urine output after transplantation is expected among patients with normal urine output pretransplant; failure of this to occur may also be an indication of allograft dysfunction.</p><p>In patients who present with low urine output <strong>or</strong> failure of the serum creatinine to decrease after transplantation, prompt evaluation and diagnosis of the cause of allograft dysfunction is critical, since certain causes of acute allograft dysfunction (such as vascular thrombosis) in the immediate postoperative setting are associated with a high risk of allograft loss. Vascular etiologies of allograft dysfunction within the first week represent a transplant emergency, and it is critical to establish that there is adequate blood flow to the transplanted kidney. Our initial approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We first perform a history and physical examination to assess for fluid balance, blood loss, or intraoperative hypotension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We next determine that the Foley catheter is not obstructed by visual inspection and irrigation, or replacement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer a 500 mL bolus of isotonic saline as a fluid challenge and give one to two doses of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> to try to increase urine output. We typically give 100 mg of furosemide to recipients of a deceased-donor transplant and 20 mg to recipients of a living-donor transplant. The risk of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is much higher in deceased-donor kidneys versus living-donor kidneys, and, therefore, recipients of deceased-donor transplants may need a higher dose of furosemide for response. In patients with hypervolemia, we give intravenous furosemide without a fluid challenge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We measure donor specific antibody (DSA) levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain a renal ultrasound with Doppler and a radionuclide renal scan to rule out obstruction, vascular thrombosis, and a urinary leak. Some clinicians prefer to obtain only a renal ultrasound without a radionuclide renal scan; however, in our experience, a radionuclide renal scan is the preferred modality for detecting a urinary leak.</p><p/><p>Our subsequent approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are found to have an abnormality on either renal ultrasound or renal scan that likely explains the allograft dysfunction (eg, vascular thrombosis, urinary leak or obstruction), we treat with the appropriate therapy (eg, surgical exploration for arterial or venous thrombosis or urinary leak) and monitor serum creatinine levels and urine output. If the serum creatinine and urine output improve, we resume routine monitoring of the patient. If the serum creatinine and urine output fail to improve despite initial successful therapy of the abnormality, we obtain a renal allograft biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have <strong>no</strong> abnormalities on either renal ultrasound or renal scan and have <strong>no</strong> evidence of new or increasing <span class=\"nowrap\">strength/titer</span> DSAs, the most likely cause of allograft dysfunction is postischemic ATN. A biopsy may be obtained immediately depending upon the clinical scenario and prebiopsy probability of identifying an unexpected cause of dysfunction. In most patients, we monitor serum creatinine levels and urine output daily for up to one week. If the serum creatinine and urine output fail to improve after one week, we obtain a renal allograft biopsy, although some clinicians choose to repeat a renal scan and renal ultrasound prior to obtaining a renal biopsy. A renal biopsy is required to evaluate for acute rejection and other possible etiologies of allograft dysfunction, including early recurrent disease (eg, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSGS]), oxalate deposition, and thrombotic microangiopathy. In addition to a biopsy, some clinicians test for the presence of non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies (such as anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) or anti-endothelial antibodies), but these are not assessed routinely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients who have <strong>no </strong>abnormalities on either renal ultrasound or renal scan and are found to have a new or increasing <span class=\"nowrap\">strength/titer</span> DSA, we obtain a renal allograft biopsy immediately to evaluate for acute antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3726392728\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with allograft dysfunction &gt;1 week posttransplant</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3912095140\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients presenting with an elevated serum creatinine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In <strong>all </strong>renal transplant recipients who present after the first week posttransplant with a <strong>new</strong> increase in serum creatinine of &ge;25 percent from baseline <strong>or</strong> a serum creatinine that is higher than expected (such as in recently transplanted patients whose serum creatinine is continuing to decrease after transplantation), we first instruct patients to increase oral hydration and recheck the serum creatinine the following day.

In deceased-donor recipients, for example, the function of the &quot;mate kidney&quot; (ie, the contralateral kidney of the deceased donor), if also recovered for transplant, should be assessed and compared with that of the recipient with allograft dysfunction. In living-donor recipients, we determine the renal function of the donor, both at the time of pre-donation evaluation as well as after donation, and compare this with that of the recipient. We prefer to assess renal function using the eGFR as determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, since timed creatinine clearances are not reliable and tend to overestimate renal function. We also review the KDPI of the donor kidney and determine whether a biopsy of the donor kidney was performed, in case the biopsy revealed evidence of arteriosclerosis or other renal disease that could contribute to allograft dysfunction.

However, the use of &quot;virtual crossmatches&quot; based upon an arbitrary anti-HLA antibody level may increase the likelihood of hyperacute or accelerated acute rejection (rejection within the first week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1246151507\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasodilatation from anesthesia with or without cytokine release from induction agents such as antilymphocyte agents (eg, antithymocyte globulin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>) predispose to fluid extravasation and intravascular volume depletion. Given this &ldquo;third-spacing&rdquo; associated with anesthesia, it is customary that the patient receives 3 to 5 liters intraoperatively to maintain sufficient intravascular volume repletion.

Prompt recognition and evaluation of allograft dysfunction is vital, as it is usually reversible. Persistent dysfunction without timely intervention may lead to irreversible loss of allograft function and, eventually, allograft failure. The causes of renal allograft dysfunction vary with the time (usually classified as immediate, early, and late period) after transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus definition for allograft dysfunction following kidney transplant. We define <strong>acute</strong> renal allograft dysfunction as one or more of the following: an increase in serum creatinine of &ge;25 percent from baseline within a one&ndash;to-three-month time period, failure of the serum creatinine to decrease following transplantation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. Delayed graft function (DGF) is defined as the need for dialysis within the first week after transplantation. <strong>Chronic</strong> renal allograft dysfunction is defined as a condition in which irreversible damage to the kidney allograft occurs over a period of weeks to months. (See <a href=\"#H39248220\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of renal allograft dysfunction depends upon the timing of presentation. A diagnosis can be established in most patients by means of thorough history and physical examination, laboratory and imaging studies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a renal allograft biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H1859156585\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the diagnosis of renal allograft dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop renal allograft dysfunction <strong>within the first week posttransplant</strong> most commonly present with low urine output or failure of the serum creatinine to decrease after transplantation. Some patients may require dialysis in the first week after transplantation (ie, those with DGF). Our initial approach is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We first perform a history and physical examination to assess for fluid balance, blood loss, or intraoperative hypotension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We next determine that the Foley catheter is not obstructed by visual inspection and irrigation, or replacement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We administer a 500 mL bolus of isotonic saline as a fluid challenge and give one to two doses of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> to try to increase urine output. We typically give 100 mg of furosemide to recipients of a deceased-donor transplant and 20 mg to recipients of a living-donor transplant. In patients with hypervolemia, we give intravenous furosemide without a fluid challenge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We measure donor specific antibody (DSA) levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We obtain a renal ultrasound with Doppler and a radionuclide renal scan to rule out obstruction, vascular thrombosis, and a urinary leak. Some clinicians prefer to obtain only a renal ultrasound without a radionuclide renal scan; however, in our experience, a radionuclide renal scan is the preferred modality for detecting a urinary leak.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Our subsequent approach is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who are found to have an abnormality on either renal scan or renal ultrasound that likely explains the allograft dysfunction (eg, vascular thrombosis, urinary leak or obstruction), we treat with the appropriate therapy and monitor serum creatinine levels and urine output.

If the serum creatinine returns to baseline following hydration, the allograft dysfunction is attributed to volume depletion, and we resume routine monitoring of the patient.

If the ultrasound is negative for obstruction or other causality, we perform a renal allograft biopsy.

Certain causes of renal allograft dysfunction (such as surgical complications) are more common in the immediate to early posttransplant period, whereas other causes (such as viral infections) are more likely to present later. However, there is some overlap between the times of presentation, and some causes of acute allograft dysfunction (such as acute rejection) may present at any time posttransplant.
