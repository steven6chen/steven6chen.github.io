The organism classically responsible for the enteric fever syndrome is <em>Salmonella</em> <em>enterica</em> serotype Typhi (formerly <em>S</em>. <em>typhi</em>). Other <em>Salmonella</em> serotypes, particularly <em>S. enterica</em> serotypes Paratyphi A, B, or C, can cause a similar syndrome; however, it is usually not clinically useful or possible to reliably predict the causative organism based on clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The term &quot;enteric fever&quot; is a collective term that refers to both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, and &quot;typhoid&quot; and &quot;enteric fever&quot; are often used interchangeably.</p><p>The pathogenesis of enteric fever will be reviewed here.

Ingested organisms survive exposure to gastric acid before gaining access to the small bowel, where they penetrate the epithelium, enter the lymphoid tissue, and disseminate via the lymphatic or hematogenous route. A chronic carrier state is established in an estimated 1 to 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].

It has been suggested that <em>S. </em>Typhi represents a single clone with little intraspecies divergence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, other studies have demonstrated that the <em>S. </em>Typhi genome has undergone significant evolutionary rearrangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Differences have been found among isolates of <em>S. </em>Typhi in pulsed field gel electrophoretic (PFGE) patterns, outer membrane protein profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and ribotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Certain flagellar serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and PFGE patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] have been associated with more severe clinical illness and greater antibiotic resistance in endemic areas. Bacterial whole-genome sequence analysis has identified a dominant multidrug-resistant lineage designated H58 that has emerged and spread through Asia and Africa over the past 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Also, long term carriers may secrete <em>S. </em>Typhi variants with considerable genetic diversity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Such changes may occur in response to antimicrobial therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> host immune responses. Of note, <em>S. </em>Paratyphi A and <em>S. </em>Typhi have undergone convergent evolution through recombination and shared pseudogene formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Taken together, these studies suggest that <em>S. </em>Typhi evolves in response to environmental pressures, that especially virulent clones may exist, and that further study is needed to understand the specific virulence properties of this pathogen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the numbers of <em>S. </em>Typhi organisms required to cause disease have been obtained from human volunteer studies and from epidemiologic investigations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In general, the greater the infectious dose, the higher the attack rate and the shorter the incubation period. In a modern human challenge study, the Quailes strain was administered in bicarbonate solution to healthy volunteers and resulted in typhoid fever with documented bacteremia in 11 of 20 (55 percent) and 13 of 20 (65 percent) subjects who received 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> colony forming unit (CFU) doses , respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The overall attack rate was 59 percent. Of note, a number of volunteers developed symptoms and had <em>S</em>. Typhi detected in their blood stream by polymerase chain reaction testing despite negative blood cultures, suggesting a possible overall attack rate of 73 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>It is difficult to generalize data obtained in experimental inoculations to actual ingestion of contaminated food and water; extrapolations from volunteer studies suggest that 10 to 20 percent of healthy individuals ingesting 10<sup>3</sup> <em>S. </em>Typhi organisms will develop typhoid fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Data compiled from 12 outbreaks related to food, water, or occupational laboratory exposures showed &quot;real life&quot; infectious doses are usually low (&lt;10<sup>3</sup>) with relatively low attack rates (averaging 4 percent) and fairly long incubation periods (12 to 21 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Smaller numbers of organisms are likely to induce disease in high-risk individuals, such as those with achlorhydria or immunosuppressive illnesses such as AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After ingestion, <em>S. </em>Typhi organisms that survive exposure to gastric acid gain access to the small bowel, where they penetrate the epithelium, enter the lymphoid tissue, and disseminate via the lymphatic or hematogenous route.</p><p>Diarrhea and constipation appear to occur with approximately equal frequency. The reasons for the variability in enteritis among <em>Salmonella </em>strains are not certain. In a cell culture model of gastroenteritis, nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> strains associated with enteritis induced IL-8-mediated neutrophil transmigration across the epithelial cell; these observations were not seen with <em>S. </em>Typhi or other strains not associated with enteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The muted IL-8 response and relative absence of neutrophil infiltration seen with <em>S. </em>Typhi may be mediated by Toll-like receptors and require the Vi capsular polysaccharide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p><em>S. </em>Typhi access the submucosal region of the bowel by two mechanisms: via the M-cell, a specialized epithelial cell that serves as a sampling and antigen presenting cell in the mucosa (or gut)-associated lymphoid system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; and via direct penetration into or around the epithelial cell itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. The entry of <em>S. </em>Typhi into the epithelial cell appears to be mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the protein that is abnormal in cystic fibrosis. In one study, mice that were heterozygous for the most common CFTR mutation seen in cystic fibrosis in humans (Delta F508) translocated 86 percent fewer <em>S. </em>Typhi into the submucosa than wild-type mice; no translocation occurred in Delta 508 homozygous mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Genetic analyses of an Indonesian case-control cohort showed that a specific CFTR polymorphism known to affect CFTR protein expression appeared to confer modest protection against acquisition of enteric fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, individuals who are heterozygous for CFTR may have a selective protection against typhoid fever.</p><p><em>S. </em>Typhi proliferate in the submucosa, leading to hypertrophy of the Peyer's patches via recruitment of mononuclear cells and lymphocytes. Na&iuml;ve subjects who developed typhoid fever after oral challenge had different patterns of monocyte and dendritic cell activation than those who did not develop illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Hypertrophy and subsequent necrosis of the submucosal tissues are probably responsible for abdominal pain and subsequent ileal perforation, a potentially fatal complication. Patients with enteric fever may develop &quot;secondary&quot; bacteremia with other organisms due to microscopic or macroscopic breaches in the intestinal mucosal barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The potential role of typhoid toxin in disease pathogenesis is an area of investigative focus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Typhoid toxin is a pyramidal holotoxin that contains a homopentamer of pertussis-like toxin B subunit (PltB) at its base, with pertussis-like toxin A (PltA; an adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase) in the center, and cytolethal distending toxin (CdtB; a DNase that results in cell cycle arrest) at the apex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Injection of the toxin in animals causes many of the symptoms associated with enteric fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic spread and persistence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dissemination of <em>S. </em>Typhi from the Peyer's patches to the reticuloendothelial system occurs via the lymphatic system and bloodstream. Replication within the reticuloendothelial system is a hallmark of enteric fever and is responsible for the clinical findings of prostration, generalized sepsis, and hepatosplenomegaly. Some individuals contain the organism within the gastrointestinal system and do not become systemically ill but have persistent <em>S. </em>Typhi carriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>Quantitative studies using density gradient separation of blood cells or buffy coat cultures from patients with typhoid fever demonstrated that <em>S. </em>Typhi isolated from blood cultures are frequently localized within the mononuclear cell-platelet layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Dissemination of the organisms via the blood stream occurs early in the course of illness; bacteremias are more frequently detected and are of higher grade during the first week of clinical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Eventually, organisms reside within monocyte-derived or tissue macrophages in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The bone marrow is a clinical &quot;sanctuary&quot; for <em>S. </em>Typhi and a possible source of diagnostic culture material even after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. These intracellular organisms are likely sources for relapsing infection and late pyogenic complications, such as pericarditis, visceral abscesses, or osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever&quot;, section on 'Other clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Replete hemophagocytic macrophages may provide a niche for <em>Salmonella</em> persistence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Acute experimentally-induced typhoid fever led to a rapid increase in the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin and a decrease in serum iron and transferrin saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It has also been proposed that the hemochromatosis C282Y mutation (present in up to 12.5 percent of northern and central Europeans) may confer resistance to infection with <em>S. </em>Typhi and mycobacteria, which require iron for growth in macrophages. Despite the total body iron overload, macrophages in C282Y homozygotes are low in iron. Hemochromatosis patients are not especially susceptible to salmonellosis or other intracellular infections, although they may be at increased risk for infection with other organisms, such as Vibrios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Persistence of intracellular <em>S. </em>Typhi organisms within visceral and bone marrow macrophages has long been believed central to virulence. Molecular approaches to the study of the pathogenesis and persistence of <em>S. </em>Typhi have been facilitated by experiments with murine models of typhoid fever and identified key genes and proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">phoP/phoQ</span> genes, which modulate transcriptional activation of bacterial proteins within macrophages, are important for full virulence; deletion of these genes markedly attenuated <em>S. </em>Typhi in human volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analysis of the <em>S. </em>Typhi proteome under conditions mimicking the intracellular macrophage environment identified a subset of highly expressed proteins unique to <em>S. </em>Typhi (versus nontyphoidal salmonellae) that likely play a role in pathogenesis and perhaps in human host specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

In contrast, a variety of host immunologic defects are known to predispose to more severe and complicated illness due to nontyphoidal salmonellosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Salmonella gastroenteritis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>There is some evidence that immunocompromised patients fare poorly with typhoidal infections, however. One study of four individuals with AIDS in Peru described atypically severe diarrhea or colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Additionally, work from a human challenge model demonstrated that, in contrast to high titers of antibodies against <em>S. </em>Typhi, high levels of <em>S.</em> Typhi-responsive CD4 cells actually increase risk of developing typhoid disease upon exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p>It has long been known that <em>S. </em>Typhi and Paratyphi A are uniquely human pathogens that do not affect other mammals (including laboratory mice), unlike nontyphoidal salmonellae. This appears to be related to fundamental differences in the way the innate and adaptive immune systems interact with these related organisms. This has been evaluated using genetically altered mice that can be rendered susceptible to <em>S. </em>Typhi. Mice lacking Toll-like receptor 11, which is not present in humans, can be infected with <em>S. </em>Typhi; the mechanism of this appears dependent upon the presence of bacterial flagellin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].
