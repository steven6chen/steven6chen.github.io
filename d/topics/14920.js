There are multiple etiologies for HUS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HUS may result in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring either dialytic therapy or transplantation. Among patients with ESRD due to HUS who undergo transplantation, the risk of recurrence depends upon the underlying etiology. Less commonly, patients who undergo renal transplantation for other causes of ESRD may also develop HUS.</p><p>This topic reviews recurrent and de novo HUS in renal transplant recipients. The causes, diagnosis, and treatment of HUS in nontransplant patients are discussed elsewhere.

Other causes include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pregnancy, cancer, and medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a>, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunosuppressive drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian [mechanistic] target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69868\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69868 \">table 1</a>). HUS may also be caused by genetic defects in complement proteins that regulate the alternative pathway, leading to dysregulated complement activation. This is referred to as &quot;complement-mediated HUS&quot; or &quot;atypical HUS.&quot; The mutations may be familial or sporadic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HUS that occurs in the transplant recipient may be recurrent or de novo. Nearly all patients with recurrent HUS have a complement-mediated disease that produced both the pretransplant HUS and the recurrence after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. De novo HUS may be due to any of the etiologies that cause thrombotic microangiopathy in the general population or may be related to the transplantation. Causes of thrombotic microangiopathy that are common among transplant recipients include immunosuppressive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], ischemia reperfusion injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], viral infections, and antibody-mediated rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3511701846\" class=\"local\">'De novo HUS'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transplant recipients who develop de novo HUS in association with any of these exposures may have a genetic susceptibility to the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This was shown in a study of 24 transplant recipients with de novo thrombotic microangiopathy, of whom seven (29 percent) had a mutation in one or more of the genes encoding the complement-regulatory proteins, complement factor H (CFH), and complement factor I (CFI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1621410552\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent HUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among all patients who have HUS as a cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and receive a kidney transplant, the recurrence rate is between 25 and 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. However, among individual patients, the risk depends upon the underlying cause of HUS in the native kidney. Recurrence is uncommon among patients who had infection-related HUS. As an example, one center reported that, among 26 transplant recipients with recurrent HUS, 25 initially had HUS that was not associated with infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Adults who develop HUS and are transplanted are more likely to have recurrence compared with children with HUS who receive a transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. In a single-center study of 35 renal transplant recipients whose ESRD was caused by HUS, recurrence occurred in 10 of 17 adult-onset cases (59 percent) versus 1 of 18 (6 percent) with childhood HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This observation is likely due to the fact that the vast majority (90 percent) of cases of childhood-onset HUS are related to Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em>, which recurs in &lt;1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in children&quot;, section on 'Recurrence after renal transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, many patients with complement-mediated HUS have recurrence after transplantation. Among such patients, the risk of recurrence depends upon the individual mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Estimates of recurrence have been reported at 50 to 100 percent among patients with mutations involving circulating factors such as complement factor H or I (CFH or CFI) and 15 to 20 percent among patients with mutations in the gene for the transmembrane protein, membrane cofactor protein (MCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, CFH and CFI mutations are more common than MCP mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F87824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87824 \">table 2</a>). A review of published outcomes after transplant in patients with non-Shiga toxin-associated HUS genotyped for CFH, CFI, and MCP mutations demonstrated an overall recurrence rate of 60 percent, with graft failure in 92 percent of those having recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is not known why there is such disparity in the rate of recurrence among patients with different mutations. A potential explanation for the low recurrence rate of MCP-associated HUS is that MCP is highly expressed in the kidney and potentially restored with the transplantation of a new kidney allograft.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that recurrence may be less common among patients who have undergone a nephrectomy prior to transplantation. In one study that analyzed pooled data from several series, recurrence was reported among 5 of 14 patients who had undergone nephrectomy compared with 27 of 35 patients who had not undergone nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, this observation has not been repeated, and we generally do not perform nephrectomy in order to prevent recurrence among patients with HUS. (See <a href=\"#H454064889\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrent HUS'</a> below.)</p><p>Other risk factors that have been associated with recurrent HUS in the renal allograft include a short duration between disease onset and ESRD or transplantation, receiving a living-related donor kidney, and use of calcineurin inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3511701846\"><span class=\"h2\">De novo HUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>De novo HUS can affect 3 to 14 percent of kidney transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/3,12,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,20-22</a>].

Patients commonly present with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851 \">picture 1</a>), thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury (AKI).</p><p>Typical laboratory abnormalities include an increased serum creatinine, evidence of hemolysis (such as increased reticulocyte percentage, reticulocytosis, schistocytes on peripheral smear, and increased serum lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]), and a low platelet count. The urinalysis typically shows hematuria and only a small amount of proteinuria. Some patients may present with only an increased serum creatinine and abnormal urinalysis due to the renal lesion associated with HUS (thrombotic microangiopathy) and without thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>].</p><p>Patients with recurrent HUS usually present within one year after transplantation and often within days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In one study of 16 patients with recurrent disease, eight patients presented within one month of transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

It is often difficult to accurately identify patients with HUS related to genetic mutations based upon clinical features alone since HUS related to a genetic mutation may produce a prodromic, diarrhea-like illness. Such patients are best identified by genetic screening. Laboratories that offer complement genotyping for HUS can be found through the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GeneTests/lab/disease/atypical+hus?db=genetests&search_param=contains&amp;token=oNz6QKpDtHy+Ir7LKk2pP66SxGN+cNNVbblZmB5n8QcHJnCJKoRRtKxco8XiH+khSZWtjCCPEiuOKf6wyS+RqlOhOwso4i821huqgbD+2C7u/e4Xj2F4JtkgTQx7Zj/PrwC1JCwUsNIWoeWxLU0oqw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7350\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1042706718\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of donor kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For several reasons, we recommend <strong>not</strong> using a living-related donor kidney for patients with HUS attributed to a genetic mutation. As noted above, there is a high rate of recurrence with such transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/10,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,36</a>]. In addition, the donor may have a similar mutation, and nephrectomy may trigger HUS in the genetically susceptible donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Although genetic analysis may be performed in donors, some patients have more than one mutation, and approximately one-third of patients with HUS have complement mutations presently unidentified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, a negative mutational analysis of a potential living-related donor does not guarantee freedom from mutations associated with complement-mediated HUS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H592627753\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> (an antibody that targets the complement component C5) prior to transplantation in all patients with complement-mediated HUS due to a genetic deficiency or dysfunction of complement factor H or I (CFH or CFI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. We do <strong>not</strong> use eculizumab as prophylactic therapy in patients who had ESRD related to infection- or drug-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.</p><p>The optimal prophylactic regimen is not known.

It is possible that eculizumab could be discontinued with subsequent reinstitution among those who have disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, no reliable marker of early disease recurrence is available. Until these data are available, we suggest continuing the drug indefinitely.</p><p>Some clinicians treat with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> and plasmapheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/38,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,42</a>]. However, the added therapeutic benefit of plasmapheresis is unclear when using eculizumab. In addition, since eculizumab is removed with pheresis, a supplemental dose must be given after each pheresis procedure. Given this, along with the costs and risks of the pheresis procedure, we do <strong>not </strong>use plasmapheresis at our center and use eculizumab alone.</p><p>Given the high cost of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> therapy, some centers have tried to develop alternative transplant strategies that do not use prophylactic eculizumab. As an example, one case series from the Netherlands reported outcomes of 17 patients with complement-mediated HUS who underwent living-donor kidney transplantation without eculizumab prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. All patients were at high or moderate risk for recurrent disease; 16 had pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in CFH, C3, CFI, or membrane cofactor protein, and five had lost a previous transplant due to recurrent HUS. The transplant protocol consisted of induction therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a>; triple-therapy maintenance immunosuppression with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil targeted to a high area under the curve (AUC) level, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>; strict blood pressure control <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;130/80</span> mmHg); and early initiation of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. At a median of 25 months, all patients had stable graft function (median serum creatinine 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [106 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> without significant proteinuria; only one patient developed recurrent HUS, which responded to eculizumab treatment. These findings suggest that in patients with complement-mediated HUS, kidney transplant without prophylaxis may be feasible; however, additional longer-term studies are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of this approach.</p><p>In patients with ESRD due to HUS related to mutations of complement factors that are produced by the liver (eg, CFH), combined kidney-liver transplant has been used to both correct the ESRD along with the underlying etiology of HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. However, dual-organ transplantation carries significant potential morbidity and mortality. Additionally, uncontrolled complement activation precipitated by the stress of surgery has led to widespread perioperative vascular thrombosis and graft loss as the liver allograft may not function initially to produce sufficient amounts of the complement protein. Success with combined liver-kidney transplant has improved with the use of intensive plasmapheresis in the pre- and perioperative time to restore levels of the complement protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-and-de-novo-hus-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2690244466\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with recurrent HUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all patients who develop recurrent HUS are assumed to have a complement-mediated process.

Among patients with ESRD due to HUS who undergo transplantation, HUS commonly recurs, particularly among patients with HUS that is related to a genetic mutation. Less commonly, patients who undergo renal transplantation for other causes of ESRD may also develop de novo HUS. De novo HUS due to immunosuppressive drugs, ischemia reperfusion injury, viral infections, and antibody-mediated rejection may also occur among transplant recipients.

Patients commonly present with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Typical laboratory abnormalities include an increased serum creatinine, evidence of hemolysis, and a low platelet count. The urinalysis typically shows hematuria and only a small amount of proteinuria. Some patients may present with only an increased serum creatinine and abnormal urinalysis due to the renal lesion associated with HUS and without thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. The diagnosis is made by biopsy.
