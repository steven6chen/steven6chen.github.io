The placenta fulfills several critical roles as the interface between mother and fetus: it prevents rejection of the fetal allograft, enables respiratory gas exchange, transports nutrients, eliminates fetal waste products, and secretes peptide and steroid hormones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY DEVELOPMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12098174\"><span class=\"h2\">Implantation and invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Development of the placenta and fetus is a continuous process that begins at the time of fertilization. The first three days of development occur within the fallopian tube. Four days after fertilization, the morula (a solid mass of blastomere cells) enters the uterus. On the fifth day after fertilization, the morula becomes a blastocyst as fluid accumulates and polarization of the cells occurs. The blastocyst has an outer layer of cells (trophoblast) that will form the placenta and fetal membranes, an inner cell mass at one pole that will form the embryo, and a fluid filled cavity. The inner and outer cell masses multiply and the fluid cavity enlarges until the expanded blastocyst hatches out of the zona shell. Initially it is bathed in uterine secretions that provide oxygen and metabolic substrates; however, these secretions soon become inadequate for support of further development. Therefore, within 24 hours of hatching (about day 6 after fertilization), the blastocyst implants in the uterine lining, which provides access to substrates (glycogen filled stromal cells) necessary for continued growth. Implantation involves movement of the blastocyst to an optimal location (typically the mid to upper anterior or posterior wall of the uterus), adhesion, and invasion. As the trophoblast erodes deeper into the decidua, vacuoles form and become confluent to form lacunae by day 13 after fertilization. The lacunar space eventually becomes the intervillous space.</p><p>The progenitor cytotrophoblast cell is the stem cell of the placenta. These cells proliferate throughout gestation, differentiating along two pathways to form either villous cytotrophoblast which ultimately can become syncytiotrophoblasts (outer cellular layer) or extravillous cytotrophoblasts (inner cellular layer) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57887\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57887 \">algorithm 1</a>). Syncytiotrophoblast is a specialized epithelium that has several functions, including transport of gases, nutrients, and waste products and synthesis of peptide and steroid hormones that regulate placental, fetal, and maternal systems. Extravillous trophoblast (EVT) has a proliferative component and an invasive component. There is also a migratory EVT, which is neither invasive nor proliferative. These cells populate the cell islands, septum, chorionic plate and chorion laeve. </p><p>At four to five weeks of gestation (menstrual dates), EVT erupts in columns with proliferative trophoblast at the base and invasive trophoblast at the distal portion of the column. Invasive EVT that invades decidua is called interstitial EVT, whereas EVT that invades and remodels the spiral arteries is called endovascular EVT. Endovascular invasion (intramural or intra-arterial) involves replacement or displacement of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells and transforms the narrow spiral arteries into wide uteroplacental arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57887\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57887 \">algorithm 1</a>). Anastomoses between the dilated spiral arteries and endometrial veins form maternal sinusoids, which eventually distribute blood into the low resistance vascular network of the lacunar system, thus establishing the uteroplacental circulation. </p><p>During invasion, EVT expresses specific proteins defining the stage and role in the differentiation and invasion process. These include integrin cell-extracellular matrix antigens, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), signal transduction proteins such as transforming growth factor-&szlig; (TGF-&szlig;), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptors, and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2).</p><p>To invade the decidua and myometrium, the EVT must degrade the extracellular matrix by employing several members of the MMP protease family. The activity of these MMPs is regulated by their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). TIMP-1, an inhibitor of all MMPs, and TIMP-2 have been found in decidual cells and EVTs. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulates trophoblast invasion via the met receptor and induction of MMP-9. The decidua prevents uninhibited EVT invasion by secreting locally acting factors (cytokines, protease inhibitors), which modulate trophoblast invasion.</p><p>The trophoblast shell plugs the ends of uteroplacental vessels early in gestation, such that very early in gestation placental tissue develops in a low oxygen environment supported by histiotrophic nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Histiotroph is an extracellular material that is produced by endometrial glands in the decidua and accumulates in the space between the maternal and fetal tissues. It is phagocytosed initially by the trophectoderm of the blastocyst, and later by the trophoblast of the placenta or the endoderm of the yolk sac. This environment is thought to protect the developing embryo from oxygen free radical mediated teratogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At 10 to 14 weeks of gestation, the trophoblastic plugs are displaced and blood flows into the intervillous space to facilitate gas and nutrient exchange (ie, hemotrophic nutrition: the exchange of blood-borne materials between the maternal and fetal circulations). The increased blood flow at this time increases the intraplacental oxygen concentration three-fold and imposes oxidative stress, which is overwhelming in some pregnancies and leads to miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Oxygen is also a major regulator of trophoblast invasion. Expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and of TGF-&szlig;3, an inhibitor of invasion, parallels changes in oxygen tension. Thus, they are high in the first trimester when oxygen tension in the placental bed is low and trophoblast invasion occurs, and then fall at 10 to 12 weeks of gestation when blood flow to the intervillous space is established and oxygen tension rises. In vitro, low oxygen tension (hypoxia) promotes trophoblast differentiation down the EVT pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12098281\"><span class=\"h2\">Villous development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the second week of placental development, a layer of syncytiotrophoblast with a core of cytotrophoblast evaginates into the lacunar space to form primary mesenchymal villi. With further development, they acquire an inner core of embryonic mesoderm and become secondary villi. By day 21, the embryonic mesoderm differentiates into blood vessels that subsequently connect to vessels developing in the umbilical cord and embryo, thus forming tertiary villi. Some villi are anchored to the maternal decidua, others float freely in the lacuna. The embryonic circulation is always separated from maternal decidua and blood by a layer of trophoblast.</p><p>Villous cytotrophoblast cells form a continuous layer (the Langhans layer) around first trimester placental villi and donate daughter cells to the overlying continuous syncytium, the syncytiotrophoblast. In late gestation, few villous cytotrophoblast cells are found. At term, the surface area of the syncytiotrophoblast is 12 to 14 m<sup>2</sup>. Turnover of syncytiotrophoblast is controlled by the rates of fusion of villous cytotrophoblast and apoptosis. The human endogenous defective retrovirus HERV-W-derived protein syncytin is highly expressed in syncytiotrophoblast and is responsible for cytotrophoblast fusion and syncytialization of trophoblast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Decreased syncytin expression is seen in preeclamptic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>In pregnancies at high altitude where there is a relative hypoxia or those complicated by maternal anemia, proliferation of cytotrophoblast cells and increased syncytiotrophoblast formation increase the amount of placental surface area for exchange.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175804821\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proportion of the placenta occupied by blood vessels increases throughout gestation to facilitate nutrient transport. The three stages<sup> </sup>of human placental vascular development are an initial stage of<sup> </sup>vasculogenesis followed by branching and then nonbranching<sup> </sup>angiogenesis. The two umbilical arteries and the vein divide into networks of secondary vessels, and then further divide into tertiary vessels before entering the main stem villi. These vessels then divide two to five times to form rami chorii (intermediate villi) and further divide to form ramuli chorii, some of which terminate in the terminal villi, the functional units of exchange (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59367\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59367 \">figure 1</a>). The terminal villi each contain 3 to 5 capillaries which form capillary loops and occasional sinusoids, perhaps to reduce resistance and slow blood flow in order to maximize time for gas and nutrient exchange. Oxygen also regulates villous vasculogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175804869\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal-placental vascular reactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of autonomic innervation, vascular reactivity in the placenta and umbilical cord is by humoral and <span class=\"nowrap\">autocrine/paracrine</span> factors. Regional differences in response to various families of mediators are seen throughout the umbilical cord, chorionic plate vessels, and villous vessels. Important mediators include the renin-angiotensin system, endothelin, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins, natriuretic peptides, parathyroid hormone, adrenomedullin, urocortin, and corticotropin-releasing hormone. There is abundant evidence that production and response to many of these factors are altered in pregnancies complicated by diabetes and preeclampsia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175804914\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulant activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombosis in the placental vasculature can result in pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. To prevent stasis and coagulation of blood in the low velocity intervillous space, the trophoblast actively secretes substances (ADPase, nitric oxide and carbon monoxide) that prevent platelet and leukocyte adhesion and aggregation to the trophoblast surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The trophoblast surface also has anticoagulant activity. Upon syncytialization, negatively charged phospholipids (PS) are expressed on the trophoblast surface and this may potentially activate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Annexin A5, a member of the Ca<sup>2+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/phospholipid-dependent</span> protein family, has been proposed as a regulator of thrombosis and homeostasis on the villous trophoblast of the placenta by binding to negatively charged phospholipids, where it acts as an anti-coagulant that forms a protective barrier over the trophoblast surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. By contrast, antiphospholipid antibodies are thought to oppose the actions of annexin A5 and lead to blood coagulation and thus disrupt normal trophoblast function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175804990\"><span class=\"h2\">Imprinted genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imprinting refers to the differential expression of genetic material depending on whether it was inherited from the male or female parent. To date, at least 80 imprinted genes have been described in humans. Imprinted genes may have a role in placental development and in the fetal demand for, and the placental supply of, maternal nutrients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Gene knockout studies in mice have shown that the function of paternally expressed imprinted genes is to enhance fetal growth, whereas maternally imprinted genes suppress fetal growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175804788\"><span class=\"h1\">ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175804536\"><span class=\"h2\">Preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in trophoblast differentiation occur in various pathophysiological situations and may underlie pregnancy disorders, such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction (IUGR).</p><p>Preeclampsia and IUGR are associated with defects in endovascular EVT invasion, where some spiral arteries are not invaded at all and some are superficially invaded, leading to lack of the normal physiological adaptation of spiral arteries to pregnancy, reduced blood flow into the intervillous space, and relative <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoxia/ischemia</span>. Interstitial EVT density, however, is not different in preeclamptic pregnancy. Minimal EVT apoptosis is seen in normal pregnancy, but 15 to 50 percent of cells are apoptotic in preeclamptic pregnancy, a finding associated with macrophages around spiral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism for defective invasion may involve defects in protein expression. For example, integrin expression and increased TGF-&szlig; expression appear to play a role in inhibiting trophoblast invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, trophoblast from preeclamptic pregnancies produce less HGF, and anti-HGF antibody blocks HGF-induced invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>During normal pregnancy, syncytiotrophoblast fragments are constantly shed into the maternal circulation (approximately 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">fragments/day)</span> as a result of apoptosis or necrosis, without eliciting a maternal immune response. The rate of syncytiotrophoblast apoptosis is increased from 2 to 3 percent in normal pregnancy to 5 to 6 percent in pregnancies complicated by IUGR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] or preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2361569\"><span class=\"h2\">Placenta creta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placenta creta is characterized by lack of intervening decidua which allows direct contact of anchoring villous tissue to underlying myometrium. This leads to excessive invasion, an adherent placenta, and bleeding. The scenario has parallels to tubal pregnancy where the absence of decidua in the fallopian tube is associated with deep invasion of trophoblast into adjacent vessels.</p><p>Placental attachment disorders are classified according to the depth of myometrial penetration. In placenta accreta, villi embed on the myometrium in the absence of decidua; in placenta increta, villi embed deeper into myometrium, whereas in placenta percreta, the villi have penetrated through the uterine serosa. Whether the pathology results from lack of decidua or over-invasiveness of trophoblast is controversial.</p><p>Studies of EVT invasion in placenta creta are lacking. Conflicting findings have been presented regarding the extent and depth of vascular remodeling by EVT in these pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Creta is associated with increased depth of invasion by both interstitial and endovascular trophoblast, but outer myometrial vessels are not remodeled, suggesting it is not simply the lack of decidua that allows deep myometrial invasion. The strong association of placenta creta with a history of prior cesarean delivery and endometrial curettage suggests a role for uterine scarring. The depth of uterine invasion may be dependent on the depth of the original scar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] with increta and percreta perhaps more likely to arise from dehiscence of a scar giving cells of the trophoblast columns access to large outer myometrial vessels. However, this explanation would not explain placenta accreta in primigravidas with no history of trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In summary, the pathophysiology of creta is complex and may involve both defects in decidua, trophoblast invasiveness, and physical uterine factors, such as scarring. Whether the progression from accreta to percreta is governed by defects in mechanisms regulating trophoblast invasion or determined by physical factors is also in need of study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12098190\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational trophoblastic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gestational trophoblastic disease arises from abnormal proliferation of trophoblast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-trophoblastic-disease-pathology#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational trophoblastic disease: Pathology&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">METABOLIC AND ENDOCRINE FUNCTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolic and endocrine functions of the placenta must be tightly controlled to ensure maintenance of a healthy pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic functions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The placenta is capable of synthesizing glycogen and cholesterol, which are sources of energy for the developing fetus. Additionally, cholesterol is an important precursor in hormone production.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glycogen synthesis</strong> &ndash; The placenta is capable of synthesizing appreciable amounts of glycogen, which it stores as an energy reserve. The uptake of glucose from the maternal circulation is a rate limiting step in this process, which involves a series of enzymes and regulators. Of particular importance is the enzyme glycogenin, which is co-expressed with the high affinity GLUT-3 transporter in the endothelium, basal decidua, and invading extravillous trophoblast of the human placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cholesterol synthesis</strong> &ndash; The demands for cholesterol in the fetus are high. In early pregnancy, maternal cholesterol contributes substantially to this requirement, while in late gestation, the fetus synthesizes cholesterol from placental stores of fatty acids established from maternal body fat accumulation in early pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Placental cholesterol is an important precursor for placental production of progesterone and estrogens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protein metabolism</strong> &ndash; Protein metabolism in the placenta is largely governed by the demands of growth throughout gestation. At week 10, placental protein production is approximately 1.5 g per day, but by term this figure rises to 7.5 g daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lactate</strong> &ndash; Lactate, a waste product of metabolism, is produced in large quantities by the placenta and therefore needs to be efficiently removed. L-lactate transporters are active on the microvillous membrane of human placenta and are present on the basal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine functions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The placenta is not innervated, hence any communication between it, the mother, and the fetus must involve humoral agents. The signaling molecules secreted by the placenta can act locally through paracrine and autocrine regulation. The placenta also acts as an important endocrine organ and is responsible for the release of hormones into both the fetal and maternal circulation. The hormones produced by the placenta can be split into two categories: peptide hormones (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], human placental lactogen [hPL], cytokines, growth hormone [GH], insulin-like growth factors [IGF's], corticotropin releasing hormone [CRH], vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], placental growth factor [PIGF]) and steroid hormones (estrogens, progesterone and glucocorticoids).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Peptide hormones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main site of production of the placental hormones is the trophoblast of the chorionic villi.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Human chorionic gonadotropin</strong> &ndash; HCG is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast into the maternal blood, where it maintains the endocrine activity of the corpus luteum (ie, synthesis of progesterone during the early stages of pregnancy). It can be detected in maternal serum as early as day 8 after conception. Levels of hCG rise throughout the early stages of pregnancy and reach their maximum level at week 8 of gestation. By week 13, the level drops dramatically and reaches a low steady state. By this time, the placenta itself produces enough progesterone to support pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Human placental lactogen</strong> &ndash; HPL is a single chain peptide hormone synthesized by the trophoblast and released into the maternal blood. The principal action of hPL is to increase the supply of glucose to the fetus by decreasing maternal stores of fatty acids. It does this by altering maternal secretion of insulin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insulin-like growth factors</strong> &ndash; The IGF signaling system plays an important role in normal physiology and fetal growth regulation. There are three ligands, insulin, IGF-I and IGF-2, at least four receptors and six IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). The IGF axis is a complex signaling pathway that is a major regulator of growth in the fetus and postnatally. IGF-2 is the predominant growth factor and acts by binding to the IGF-1 receptor and initiating a signaling cascade that induces cellular proliferation, survival, and growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Corticotropin releasing hormone</strong> &ndash; CRH is a 162 amino acid peptide that is synthesized by syncytiotrophoblast. Glucocorticoids stimulate placental CRH expression (but inhibit hypothalmic CRH), whereas progesterone and estrogen inhibit CRH. CRH concentration in the maternal circulation increases exponentially throughout gestation, but it is bound to a CRH binding protein (CRHBP) secreted by liver, so there is no CRH effect on the maternal pituitary. Concentrations of CRHBP decrease prior to term, so that unbound CRH becomes available, and this is postulated to play a role in the onset of labor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In women with idiopathic preterm labor, a more rapid increase in maternal CRH concentration is seen, leading to the hypothesis that placental CRH determines the length of gestation (&quot;placental clock&quot;). CRH secreted into the fetal circulation may drive increased cortisol production, maturation of the fetal lung, and increased surfactant production. CRH and the related protein urocortin are also vasodilators of the fetal-placental circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor</strong> &ndash; VEGF is synthesized in villous trophoblast and macrophages, where it is then secreted into the maternal circulation and acts via two receptors, VEGF-R1 (FLT) and VEGF-R2 (KDR), which are found in villous vascular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The action of VEGF secreted into maternal plasma is negated by binding to a soluble binding protein sFLT-1. Hypoxia stimulates production of both VEGF and sFLT-1 with increased concentrations seen in preeclamptic pregnancy. In the placenta, VEGF acting via FLT-1 and KDR is thought to be involved in branching angiogenesis in early pregnancy. PIGF is produced in villous syncytiotrophoblast and the media of large villous vessels and also acts via VEGF-R1 and -R2. PIGF acts via FLT-1 in non-branching angiogenesis in the last trimester of pregnancy and expression is down-regulated by hypoxia, suggesting that oxygen tension may regulate the balance of VEGF and PIGF and thus, the effects seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Steroid hormones are lipophilic molecules, which are protein bound in the bloodstream and can readily cross the bi-lipid membrane of cells. When these hormones bind to their intracellular receptors, the specific complex formed has high affinity for nuclear binding sites. They alter the genetic activity of the cell and thus alter biochemical events.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Progesterone</strong> &ndash; Progesterone is necessary for the maintenance of a quiescent, non-contractile uterus. The hormone has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions which protect the conceptus from immunological rejection by the mother. Initially, progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum in order to prepare the endometrium for implantation of the conceptus. Around 35 to 47 days post ovulation, the placenta takes over progesterone production (luteo-placental shift) and the levels are sufficient to solely support the maintenance of pregnancy. Maternal cholesterol is the substrate for progesterone synthesis and the 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme (3-HSD) is the rate limiting step. Progesterone concentrations are higher in pregnant women over 30 years and lower in multiparous women and smokers compared with younger women, nulliparas, and nonsmokers, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estrogens</strong> &ndash; Estrogens are secreted by the corpus luteum and the adrenal cortex, as well as the placenta. hCG stimulates the synthesis of estrogen in the placenta, where the syncytiotrophoblast produces it in large quantities. However, the placenta alone is not capable of estrogen production de novo as it cannot hydroxylate C21 steroids at the 17 position. The maternal, and primarily the fetal, bloodstreams that perfuse the placenta provide dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), the substrate for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> and estradiol, and 16-hydroxy-DHEAS, the substrate for estriol. Large amounts of DHEAs are secreted by the fetal adrenal glands and converted to estrogens in the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Hydrolysis by placental sulfatase yields DHEA and 16-hydroxy-DHEA, which are then acted on by 3-HSD and aromatase to yield estrogens. Aromatase is oxygen sensitive, which may account for the low concentration of estrogens in women with placental insufficiency. Placental production of estrogens is higher when the fetus is female and increases in a linear fashion to term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Estrogen production is lower in women over 30 years and multiparous women compared with young women and nulliparas, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glucocorticoids</strong> &ndash; Glucocorticoids play a crucial role in regulation of organ development and maturation. However, fetal exposure to excessive maternal glucocorticoids may cause growth restriction and can lead to problems, such as hypertension, in later life. Although the placenta does not synthesize glucocorticoids de novo, it regulates exposure of the fetus to glucocorticoids by the 11&szlig;- hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase enzymes, which catalyze reduction (11&szlig;-HSD1) or oxidation (11&szlig;-HSD2) of glucocorticoids. 11&szlig;-HSD2 is located throughout the syncytiotrophoblast layer where its expression increases with gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and it serves to metabolize cortisol to inactive cortisone, thus protecting the fetus against excessive exposure to maternal cortisol. Additionally, a substantial increase in 11&szlig;-HSD2 is observed around 10 to 12 weeks of gestation when blood flow to the intervillous space is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. An increase in the ratio of 11&szlig;-HSD2 to 11&szlig;-HSD1 in placental membranes near term is associated with a switch in placental glucocorticoid metabolism, which may be responsible for the maturation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">PLACENTAL TRANSFER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syncytiotrophoblast layer of the placenta is the main site of exchange for nutrients and gases between the maternal bloodstream and the fetus. The efficient transfer of nutrients and solutes across the placenta is essential for normal fetal growth and development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several mechanisms by which transfer occurs:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Solvent drag</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solvent drag is the movement (bulk flow) of water in which solutes and nutrients are dissolved. Bulk flow has been demonstrated in the perfused human placental cotyledon in response to hydrostatic pressure changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Simple diffusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple diffusion is the passive transfer of solutes driven by concentration and electrical gradients. All solutes are transferred by diffusion, but the relative contribution is dependent on molecular properties. As an example, lipophilic molecules, such as respiratory gases, are readily exchanged by simple diffusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Transcellular transfer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This type of transfer utilizes transport proteins in the microvilli or basal membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast. There are three types:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Channels</strong> &ndash; These proteins form water-filled pores in the plasma membrane through which ions diffuse down an electrochemical gradient. Charged hydrophilic substances, which are insoluble in lipids, can be transported this way. Aquaporins are an example of channels that function in the transport of water and small molecules; they are essential for fetal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong> &ndash; These transporters are saturable carrier proteins, which are independent of metabolic energy. As an example, glucose is transported by the facilitated GLUT transporters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carrier mediated active transport</strong> &ndash; Primary active transport utilizes ATP to move solutes against a gradient, Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase are two examples. Secondary active transport utilizes concentration gradients across the cell that are set by the primary system, Na<sup>+</sup>amino acid co-transport and the Ca<sup>2+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/Na<sup>+</sup></span> exchanger are examples. Transport ATPases are known to be present in human placenta. These include the Na<sup>+</sup>: K<sup>+</sup> pump (Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase), which is localized to the microvillous and basal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], and a high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase located on the basal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Endocytosis and exocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During endocytosis, material is engulfed in a sample of extracellular fluid to form a fluid filled vesicle following invagination of the cell surface. Exocytosis is the reverse of this process, where vesicles fuse with the cell membrane to release their contents. This process can be receptor mediated: triggered by a specific interaction between the solute and a receptor on the cell membrane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfer of specific substances</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory gas exchange</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both oxygen and carbon dioxide are lipophilic molecules which will cross the placenta by simple diffusion. The placental membranes are highly permeable to O<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>, thus blood flow is the rate limiting step for exchange of the respiratory gases across this tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The partial pressure and the difference between maternal and fetal hemoglobin affinity for O<sub>2 </sub>are two important factors that determine rate of exchange.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucose transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose is the primary substrate for fetal oxidative metabolism, thus its efficient transfer across the placenta is essential for normal fetal growth and development. The placenta itself is not capable of producing appreciable amounts of glucose until late in gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Therefore, uptake of maternal glucose is essential for glycogen synthesis. Members of the glucose transporter (GLUT) family facilitate glucose transfer; GLUT 1 is the abundant subtype expressed in the human trophoblast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Normal pregnancy is a state of insulin resistance so as to increase glucose availability for the fetus. Insulin resistance is exacerbated in pregnancies complicated by diabetes, where the mother may become hyperglycemic, leading to fetal hyperglycemia. As a result of fetal hyperglycemia, there is increased production of insulin, IGF-1, and leptin, resulting in stimulation of fetoplacental growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Amino acid transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetus is dependent on placental transfer of amino acids for protein synthesis for fetal growth. Protein degradation and interconversion to intermediate substrates give rise to synthesis of either glucose or ketone bodies. </p><p>The placenta plays a critical role in the delivery of amino acids to the fetus. Transfer involves three steps: uptake from the maternal circulation across the microvillous membrane, transport through the trophoblast cytoplasm, and transport across the basal membrane into the umbilical circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Transport systems within the trophoblast can be either sodium-dependent or sodium-independent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>], and differ based on their ionic substrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. All amino acids are not transferred equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] and transfer can be impaired in pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Fatty acid transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatty acids are essential for fetal development, both as an energy source and also as a precursor for several important bioactive compounds, such as prostaglandins and thromboxane. The placenta has a considerable capacity for fat uptake and transport of fatty acids. Transport involves the breakdown of triglycerides (from maternal adipose tissue) to free fatty acids and glycerol and re-esterification with intracellularly generated glycerol phosphate on the fetal side. This conversion is mediated by lipase activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunoglobulin G transfer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some proteins are transferred across the placenta. Maternal antibodies are readily transported across the placenta to confer immunity to the fetus. From early in the second trimester the concentration of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in fetal blood increases with most antibodies being acquired in the third trimester. IgG is transported across the syncytiotrophoblast via the Fc receptor, FcRn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most drugs cross the placenta by simple diffusion; however, any of the mechanisms of placental transfer described above may be involved. Plasma membrane carriers, biotransforming enzymes, and export pumps also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Factors that affect transfer include molecular weight, degree of ionization, lipid solubility, protein binding, and fetal and placental blood flow. Nonionized, nonprotein bound, lipid soluble drugs with molecular weight below 600 Daltons freely cross the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. High molecular weight drugs, such as insulin (6000 Daltons), are not transported in significant amounts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2354901\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcium and vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At term, the fetal ionized calcium concentration is significantly higher than the maternal (2.8 versus 2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/liter)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Calcium is transported from the maternal circulation to the fetal despite the higher concentration of ionized calcium in the fetal circulation; this suggests active transport of calcium across the placenta must occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/57-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-64</a>]. Maintenance of fetal calcium homeostasis largely depends upon parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which regulates active placental calcium transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. </p><p>Fetal hypercalcemia inhibits fetal parathyroid hormone (PTH) activity and stimulates fetal calcitonin release. This environment (high calcium, low PTH, high calcitonin) is ideal for skeletal mineralization. Skeletal mineralization occurs in the latter weeks of pregnancy, so most of the 25 to 30 g of calcium present in the term fetus crosses the placenta over a period of a few weeks, peaking at the 35<sup>th</sup> week. Between the 20th and 35<sup>th</sup> week of gestation, placental calcium transport increases from 50 to 330 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>The fetus depends on the transfer of maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D across the placenta; fetal cord blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are comparable to, or slightly lower than, maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Although maternal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels rise during pregnancy, the fetal level remains low. It appears that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is prevented from crossing the placenta by the action of a placental 24-hydroxylase, which converts 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, a less active metabolite of vitamin D than its precursor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H816297319\"><span class=\"h1\">PLACENTAL INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The placenta is not a sterile environment, a placental microbiome similar to the oral microbiome&nbsp;in nonpregnant women has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. The role of the placental microbiome in healthy pregnancies and those with complications, particularly preterm birth, is an active area of investigation.</p><p>The placenta generally prevents transfer of maternal bloodborne pathogens to the fetus. Its defenses include 1) syncytiotrophoblast, which lacks intercellular junctions, 2) decidual-trophoblast environment with innate cellular defenses, and 3) physical obstacles, such as a basement membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Occasionally, however, these barriers are breached, leading to placental infection and, in turn, possible fetal infection. Some of the organisms capable of placental and fetal infection include Treponema pallidum, Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, Plasmodium falciparum, and several viruses. </p><p>The surge in fetal microcephaly associated with Zika virus has prompted investigation of mechanisms mediating viral transfer across the placental barrier and antiviral defenses. While some viruses appear to be able to infect, replicate, and cross the placenta, others may infect but not replicate or cross, and others do not infect at all. The net result appears to be related to type of virus, gestational age and duration of exposure, and placental cell type infected. </p><p>Type I and III interferons are potent antiviral proteins in the placenta. Some viruses can inhibit the type I interferon pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], which not only allows viral replication and infection, but also appears to enhance the proinflammatory placental response to bacterial infection, which may facilitate bacterial infection-induced preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Reduction in placental type I interferon may also underlie the increased mortality and complications seen in pregnant women with bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>] and during influenza pandemics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>In vitro, Zika virus and dengue virus can infect all placental cell types from mid or late gestation, including cytotrophoblasts, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and Hofbauer cells, all of which express Axl, Tyro 3, and TIM-1 viral entry factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In vivo, however, type III interferons produced by the placenta in late gestation may protect it against Zika virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Placental exosomes containing type III interferons may also confer viral resistance on recipient maternal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. However, early in gestation, trophoblast lacks the components necessary for a robust antiviral response, such that differences in viral infection across gestation may be explained by changes in expression of viral defense genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-development-and-physiology/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The placenta is an organ for exchange of oxygen, nutrients, antibodies, hormones, and waste products between the mother and fetus.
