However, subsequent improvements in arrhythmia detection and treatment have had a major impact on the outcome of ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute MI.

Observations in the pre-fibrinolytic era found the following range of incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular premature beats (VPBs) &ndash; 10 to 93 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular tachycardia (VT) &ndash; 3 to 39 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular fibrillation (VF) &ndash; 4 to 20 percent</p><p/><p>In the era of early percutaneous intervention, VT (especially non-sustained VT) remains fairly common. In the MERLIN-TIMI 36 study of 6355 patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes who underwent seven days of continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring following their presentation to the hospital to assess for VT and ischemia, 25.3 percent were found to have VT (20 percent VT without ischemia, 5.3 percent VT with ischemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Compared to patients with neither VT nor ischemia on continuous ECG monitoring, patients with VT without concurrent ischemia had a significantly increased risk of both cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.2 and 2.3, respectively). Patients with VT and ischemia had an even higher risk of both cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death (adjusted HR 5.4 and 6.5, respectively).</p><p>Early series underestimated the incidence of unstable VT and VF, because they did not include patients whose MI resulted in out-of-hospital sudden cardiac death (SCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias appears to be higher with ST elevation (Q wave) than non-ST elevation (non-Q wave) infarctions (STEMI and NSTEMI).</p><p>VT is less common than VF in the peri-infarction period. This is probably due to the fact that VT usually requires a reentrant circuit and a fixed arrhythmic substrate, such as the scar from a healed MI. When VT occurs during an acute MI, it may reflect triggered activity, enhanced automaticity, or a prior infarction.

The risk factors for and the prognosis of early VT or VF in patients with STEMI are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis after early VT'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis after early VF'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Fibrinolytic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with acute MI in the fibrinolytic era, the incidence of VF has ranged from 3.7 to 6.7 percent in large studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>].</p><p>The largest experience in patients (40,895) with acute STEMI treated with fibrinolytic therapy comes from the GUSTO-1 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The overall incidence of sustained VT or VF was 10.2 percent (3.5 percent developed VT, 4.1 percent VF, and 2.7 percent both VT and VF). Approximately 80 to 85 percent of these arrhythmias occurred in the first 48 hours.</p><p>A similar frequency of VF was noted in a report from the GISSI-2 database of 9720 patients with a first MI treated with a fibrinolytic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early (&le;4 hours) primary VF (ie, VF in the absence of heart failure or shock) occurred in 3.1 percent.

First, by nature of their patient inclusion and consent issues, patients who died of SCD in the prehospital arena were excluded from the trial denominator. Secondly, fibrinolysis and reperfusion may lead to reperfusion arrhythmias, falsely increasing the incidence of MI associated arrhythmias. Given the reduced incidence of VT and VF compared to older studies, it seems likely that reperfusion does not necessarily increase the overall incidence of VF or sustained VT. Ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) have been thought to be a marker of reperfusion following fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The overall incidence of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 2.1 percent, which is lower than the 10.2 percent STEMI incidence in GUSTO-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

One series showed no difference in the incidence between 1975 and 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], while a second report noted a reduction in nonprimary VF, but no change in primary VF (ie, VF in the absence of heart failure or shock), between 1979 and 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Improvements in therapy have led to a reduction in the in-hospital mortality in those who develop VF from approximately 50 percent in 1975 to 20 percent in 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILIAL PREDISPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There may be inherited factors that predispose some individuals to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the setting of an MI. This possibility was supported by two case-control studies in slightly different populations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients presenting with a first ST elevation MI, 330 survivors of primary VF (ie, VF in the absence of heart failure or shock) were compared to 372 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These cases were compared to two control groups; 254 consecutive patients surviving an acute MI, and 470 healthy subjects. A history of SCD in first-degree relatives was ascertained in each group. The incidence of SCD was significantly higher in the relatives of SCD victims than in those of the acute MI survivors or the control subjects (5.6, 3.3, and 1.6 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>Although these observations are intriguing, this study design is subject to the possibility of recall bias, which could lead to an overestimation of the familial risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11046610\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTRICULAR PREMATURE BEATS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) after acute MI is associated with an increased total mortality in some patients, particularly those with larger infarctions and impaired left ventricular function. It is uncertain if the increased risk is attributable to VPBs alone or only to repetitive forms (ie, couplets or nonsustained VT), which often occur in association with frequent VPBs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence of and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death after acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11046617\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-thrombolytic era</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the widespread use of thrombolytic therapy for treatment of acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a number of reports found that repetitive ventricular premature beats (VPBs), but not frequent VPBs alone, were associated with an increased risk among post-MI patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. In the largest of these series, the prognostic significance of VPBs detected in a one hour electrocardiogram monitoring session was evaluated in 1739 men with a recent MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. At a mean follow-up of two years, patients with ventricular bigeminy, couplets, or multiform VPBs had a three-fold increase in sudden death and a two-fold increase in all-cause mortality. In comparison, this was not noted in those who had only simple VPBs, regardless of frequency. The increase in risk persisted at later follow-up at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There is evidence that early R on T VPBs (ie, VPBs occurring during the apex of the T wave, correlating with the vulnerable period) may be of particular concern in patients with a STEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>In contrast, other studies have found that an increased frequency of VPBs alone may be associated with an increased mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. As an example, the European Infarction Study Group noted a 4 percent two-year mortality in post-MI patients with more than 10 VPBs per hour, a value significantly higher than in that seen in those with no or fewer VPBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The two-year mortality was much greater in patients with ventricular couplets (22 and 10 percent if more than ten and one to nine couplets per day, respectively).</p><p>There are also conflicting data as to whether the effect of VPBs upon sudden death in post-MI patients is independent of left ventricular dysfunction. It is possible, for example, that VPBs may only signify the presence of a severe myocardial process and may not be an independent provoker of a terminal electrical event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, although a relationship exists between the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction, the results of several large well-designed studies have found that an increased frequency of complex VPBs is an important risk factor independent of the degree of myocardial damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11046624\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombolytic era</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of patients with an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated in the thrombolytic era have also noted an increased mortality rate associated with ventricular premature beats (VPB) in the post infarction period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p>A review from the GISSI-2 trial evaluated 8676 patients with STEMI treated with thrombolytic therapy undergoing 24-hour Holter monitoring before discharge: 64 percent had at least one VPB per hour and 20 percent had more than 10 VPBs per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. At six months, the mortality rate was 5.5 percent in patients with more than 10 VPBs per hour compared to 2.0 and 2.7 percent in patients without ventricular arrhythmia or with 1 to 10 VPBs per hour, respectively. After adjusting for risk factors, more than 10 VPBs per hour remained a significant predictor for both total (relative risk 1.62, 95% CI 1.16-2.26) and sudden mortality (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.22-4.08).</p><p>As in the prethrombolytic era, it is uncertain if the increase in risk after thrombolysis is attributable to VPBs themselves or to the presence of repetitive forms that occur in association with frequent VPBs.

The potential efficacy of this approach was illustrated in a report of four patients (out of 2340 seen with an acute MI) with persistent electrical storm despite beta blockers and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. All episodes were triggered by monomorphic ventricular premature beats (VPBs) with right bundle branch block morphology. Activation mapping of the VPBs identified the sites of earliest activation with Purkinje potentials at the same sites. Six to thirty radiofrequency applications abolished these local potentials and suppressed VPBs in all patients, who subsequently remained free of VT or VF for 5 to 33 months.
