Such pain often results from trauma but may stem from nontraumatic conditions. Generally, we define acute conditions of the wrist as those present for less than two weeks, subacute conditions as those present for two weeks to three months, and chronic conditions are those that have been present for longer than three months.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview to acute wrist pain or injury in the adult. Subacute and chronic causes of wrist pain and specific wrist injuries are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-radius-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal radius fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44935758\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy and biomechanics of the wrist are reviewed in detail separately.

The three major categories are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute wrist pain, either from trauma or associated with overuse</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic wrist pain &ndash; Chronic causes of wrist pain are discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrist pain without trauma or overuse, possibly associated with systemic symptoms (see <a href=\"#H59023443\" class=\"local\">'Wrist pain not associated with trauma or overuse'</a> below)</p><p/><p>The first important distinction to make when establishing the diagnostic category is whether the pain is acute or chronic. Keep in mind that acute pain may reflect an exacerbation of a chronic condition. Once a major diagnostic category is identified, the next step is to determine the region of the wrist that is affected, and then the precise diagnosis. The major diagnostic categories are described further below. </p><p>While inspection, range of motion, and basic strength and neurovascular testing are typically performed in every patient with wrist pain, provided excessive pain does not preclude such examination, the clinician determines which specific structures warrant more thorough evaluation, including which special wrist examination maneuvers to perform, based upon the most likely diagnostic category.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59023431\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute wrist pain associated with trauma or overuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of acute wrist pain associated with trauma is usually clear-cut, although the precise mechanism may be difficult to establish. Such a history combined with the major site of pain allows the clinician to focus on the wrist structures most likely to have been injured. </p><p>Patients with acute wrist pain that developed or increased abruptly after excessive activity, but who clearly have not sustained direct trauma, often suffer from acute-on-chronic pain related to overuse. Acute pain associated with overuse typically arises towards the end of an activity that exceeds what the patient is used to doing. A classic example is the patient with carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis. Such a patient may have mild underlying chronic pain that does not bother them enough to take medication or seek medical evaluation, but after an entire day spent, for example, doing yard work or painting their house, the pain can suddenly become severe. Such patients typically complain of acute pain that began on a particular day, but the underlying osteoarthritis causing the pain is a chronic condition. </p><p>The same principle applies to acute exacerbations of a wrist tendinopathy. When asked, these patients often report a progressive pain pattern that preceded any acute increase in pain and had caused increasing functional limitations or complete cessation of a particular activity. Although the history may be different, as these vignettes suggest, the evaluation and management of acute exacerbations of pain from chronic overuse are generally the same as those for the chronic conditions themselves.</p><p>Once the patient&rsquo;s wrist pain is placed into one of the three categories, the location of the pain is key to determining the differential diagnosis, and ultimately a diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59023437\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic wrist pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic wrist pain associated with overuse is the major diagnostic category to consider if pain has persisted for approximately three months or longer and there has been no sudden inciting trauma associated with the development of pain. The causes and approach to chronic wrist pain are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59023443\"><span class=\"h2\">Wrist pain not associated with trauma or overuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic or acute wrist pain in an adult without inciting trauma or a history of overuse is a &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; that a more extensive evaluation is required, particularly if the pain is associated with constitutional symptoms. The cause of such pain is much more likely to arise from a systemic illness rather than an isolated musculoskeletal injury or condition. </p><p>The presence of constitutional symptoms, such as fevers, night sweats, chills, malaise, weight loss, or chronic fatigue, or bilateral wrist symptoms, strongly suggests that the problem is systemic, although some patients with systemic rheumatologic disease may present initially without such findings and complain only of isolated, monoarticular pain. In patients with wrist pain unrelated to trauma or overuse but associated with systemic symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination should be performed, in addition to careful assessment of the wrist. Depending upon the history and examination findings, additional testing including diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory studies is likely to be necessary.</p><p>Determining whether an effusion is present is an important part of the evaluation of the patient with an acutely painful wrist unrelated to trauma or overuse. This can be accomplished in the office using ultrasound. Localized warmth, erythema, and swelling over the wrist suggest a joint effusion and the need to aspirate the wrist joint to evaluate for infection and inflammatory disease. If the wrist is aspirated, it is critical that all necessary tests be performed on the synovial fluid obtained. If the joint fluid examination is benign and the patient is not systemically ill, advanced imaging may be pursued on a routine timeline, and if necessary laboratory analysis may consist of a few simple screens for systemic infection. However, systemic symptoms or concerning synovial fluid results (eg, elevated white blood cell count) should prompt urgent evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A history of repeated flares of pain or swelling in both wrists, or other joints in addition to the wrist, particularly if these flares are increasingly severe, suggests a rheumatologic or autoimmune condition. As an example, calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease (pseudogout) can present with monoarticular wrist pain. Gout may present with monoarticular wrist pain and swelling, but wrist involvement is more common with recurrent episodes. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) too may present with bilateral wrist pain and swelling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of monoarthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with polyarticular pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infrequently, acute nontraumatic wrist pain may be caused by leukemia and other malignancies, Lyme disease, or rheumatoid arthritis. Lyme disease often goes unrecognized and late manifestations may include acute joint pain. Although not common, rheumatoid arthritis can presents as a monoarticular arthritis before full blown disease develops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy and rheumatic disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107364738\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining a thorough history is important and a detailed history alone may lead to a specific diagnosis in approximately 70 percent of wrist pain cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mechanism of injury often helps to determine management. The history is taken in an orderly sequence and should emphasize questions that have the greatest clinical relevance. When evaluating acute wrist pain, the following questions are of particular importance: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Is the pain associated with any systemic features (eg, fever, night sweats)? Does pain occur in both wrists or in other joints in addition to the wrist? </strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of systemic features or pain in both wrists or additional joints suggests that the pain may stem from a systemic illness. (See <a href=\"#H59023443\" class=\"local\">'Wrist pain not associated with trauma or overuse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Did pain begin following trauma?</strong> <strong>If so, what was the mechanism of injury?</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Wrist injuries can represent a wide variety of conditions and can be missed during an initial evaluation. As examples, a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) may lead to injuries such as scaphoid fracture, lunate dislocation, or scapholunate dissociation. The degree of force and the position of the wrist during an acute injury determine the site of greatest impact and the structures most likely to be injured. A force loading the radial side of an extended, pronated wrist (eg, falling forward) is more likely to injure the scaphoid, while a force loading the ulnar side of an extended, supinated wrist (eg, falling back) is more likely to injure the triquetrum or lunate. If the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident, the impact of the wrist on the steering wheel may have injured carpal ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Which is the patient&rsquo;s dominant hand?</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dominant hand is more likely to be injured, and the functional loss usually is greater.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Where on the wrist is the patient experiencing symptoms?</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Have the patient point to the site of greatest discomfort, or allow them to determine if symptoms are spread over a wider area. Although the degree of pain is subjective, the location of symptoms can help to narrow the differential diagnosis. As examples, pain from a ligamentous disruption is typically localized (eg, scapholunate dissociation causes pain over the radial aspect of the wrist), whereas a condition involving nerve compression creates more diffuse symptoms (eg, compression of the ulnar nerve in Guyon's canal can occur from trauma and produce paresthesias and hypesthesias in the small and ring fingers). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulnar-neuropathy-at-the-elbow-and-wrist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow and wrist&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What exact movements or activities elicit pain?</strong> <strong>Also, what movements or activities (including rest) relieve the pain?</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Any movement that elicits or increases pain should be among the last things tested by the clinician. Premature testing can lead to guarding by the patient and limit the usefulness of the rest of the examination (eg, ulnar deviation may reproduce the pain from a TFCC tear). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Describe the pain?</strong> Is it sharp, shooting, severe, dull, or diffuse? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pain caused by direct injury to a nerve tends to be sharp and burning, and travel along the nerve&rsquo;s distribution. Pain caused by a fracture is usually deep, boring, and fairly constant. Pain from a ligamentous injury often waxes and wanes depending upon activity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What is the patient&rsquo;s occupation? </strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many occupational and recreational activities can affect wrist function. As examples, prolonged typing and working with machinery may involve repetitive motion that produces wrist pain, while other hobbies, such as knitting or sewing, can produce a compressive neuropathy. These chronic conditions can lead to an acute exacerbation, which ultimately leads the patient to present for medical attention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What does the patient do for sport or recreation?</strong> More specifically, one might ask what position on a sports team do they play?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Such sport-specific information can help the clinician to determine if a wrist injury stems from repetitive stress or from direct trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96436 \">table 1</a>). Contact sports, such as American football or rugby, may involve wrist trauma, while noncontact sports, such as golf and tennis, involve repetitive stress of the wrist. Chronic wrist pain can lead to an acute event, such as a stress reaction developing into a stress fracture (eg, repetitive wrist impact from competitive divers hitting the water may lead to a carpal bone stress reaction or fracture).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107364777\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the wrist is performed in standard fashion and includes inspection, palpation, range of motion, and relevant special tests, although the assessment may be limited by the injury and patient discomfort. The history and initial examination findings determine which special tests should be performed. In all cases, a screening neurovascular assessment of the involved extremity should be performed. The examination of the wrist is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain#H5769499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107365933\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS BY REGIONS OF THE WRIST</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107365940\"><span class=\"h2\">Ulnar sided wrist pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The structures involved in common causes of ulnar sided wrist pain include those found in the accompanying graphic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86701\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86701 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107365946\"><span class=\"h3\">Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy and subluxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon can sublux or dislocate from its groove on the distal ulna, which can cause acute discomfort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85859\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85859 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F85866\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85866 \">image 1</a>). Patients describe the sensation of clicking or popping as the wrist is actively moved into supination and extension, along with pain in the area of the ulnar styloid. The usual mechanisms of injury involve either loading of the wrist while it is held in a position of flexion, supination, and ulnar deviation, or the sudden application of a force to the wrist while the ECU tendon is performing an isometric contraction. The sensation of the tendon snapping out of position may be accentuated if this movement is resisted by the examiner. Passive range of motion does not usually dislocate the tendon. </p><p>Conservative management, including immobilization, rest, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), is typically sufficient to treat this condition; in rare instances, surgery is needed. Early immobilization for ECU tendon instability involves the use of a long arm splint or cast with the forearm in pronation and the wrist in neutral position. If immobilization fails to alleviate the instability, surgery to reconstruct the ECU sheath is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Any repetitive action that entails repeated twisting and dorsiflexing of the wrist can strain the ECU tendon. ECU tendinopathy is usually a subacute or chronic condition common among people who play racquet sports, as well as those who frequently use a computer mouse or keyboard with their wrist poorly positioned (eg, excessive dorsiflexion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This condition is reviewed separately.

Acute injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex involves tears of the fibrocartilage articular disc and the tissue that connects the disc to the triquetrum and other carpals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63443 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80101\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80101 \">figure 3</a>). Trauma, such as a fall forward onto an outstretched hand, is the most common mechanism. The hand is usually in a pronated (palm down) position during the fall. Wrist pain along the ulnar aspect of the wrist is the primary symptom of TFCC injury. Pain typically increases with any activity that requires forearm rotation and ulnar deviation of the wrist. A clinician may provoke the symptoms of a TFCC injury by hyper-supinating the forearm and loading the wrist (ie, compressing the joint with an axial load) while it is held in a position of ulnar deviation and extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86755\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86755 \">picture 2</a>). TFCC injury is reviewed in greater detail separately.

The patient typically presents with a history of injury and pain at the ulnar aspect of the wrist. On examination, there is usually pain and point tenderness dorsally or along the ulnar border of the wrist, 1 to 2 cm distal to the most distal aspect of the ulna or the ulnar styloid. Wrist extension may reproduce or exacerbate pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triquetrum-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Triquetrum fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26911665\"><span class=\"h3\">Ulnar styloid impaction syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulnar styloid impingement (or impaction) syndrome occurs in individuals with, an excessively long ulnar styloid, which in certain positions can cause compression of the TFCC between it and the triquetrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. One mechanism for such compression involves repetitive flexion and ulnar deviation of the wrist while the forearm is pronated and the elbow is flexed at 90 degrees. Another mechanism involves supination, extension, and ulnar deviation of the wrist. Maneuvers that recreate these positions and movements can be used to help diagnose the condition as well. The condition is relatively common among gymnasts, who assume such positions while placing their entire body weight on their wrists while performing such exercises as the pommel horse and balance beam. A standard posteroanterior (PA) radiograph that reveals an ulnar styloid longer than 6 mm helps to confirm the diagnosis. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) arthrogram can be used to identify associated TFCC tears. The condition is managed conservatively with activity modification (avoid repetitive <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/ulnar</span> deviation of the wrist), occupational therapy, wrist bracing, and oral antiinflammatory medications. Should pain persist longer than six months despite appropriate treatment, partial resection of ulnar styloid may be needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107366088\"><span class=\"h2\">Radial sided wrist pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The structures involved in common causes of radial sided wrist pain include those found in the accompanying graphic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86702\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86702 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107366162\"><span class=\"h3\">Scaphoid fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scaphoid fractures are common following wrist trauma and the scaphoid is at relatively high risk for avascular necrosis following such a fracture. Scaphoid fractures frequently occur following a fall onto an outstretched hand and can be misdiagnosed as a wrist sprain acutely. Thus, due to delayed diagnosis, the fracture itself or AVN can present as chronic wrist pain. Examination generally reveals focal tenderness at the anatomic snuffbox (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82858 \">picture 4</a>).

Depending upon the amount of force involved and the position of the wrist during the fall, a range of possible injuries may occur. Of the potential ligamentous injuries, disruption of the ligaments stabilizing the lunate and scaphoid bones is most common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52517\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52517 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. With more forceful trauma, dissociation of the lunate and capitate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> triquetrum can occur. The symptoms associated with scapholunate dissociation vary with the severity of the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients may complain of swelling and pain over the dorsoradial aspect of the wrist (overlying the scaphoid and lunate), grip weakness, and painful or decreased wrist motion. Tenderness over the scapholunate junction is common. The scaphoid shift test can help detect ligamentous instability. This injury is reviewed in greater detail separately.

The forces from a fall onto an outstretched, extended wrist disrupt the supporting ligaments and may cause the carpal bones to shift dorsally. Both the direction of the force and the relative weakness of the volar ligaments lead to the dorsal displacement.</p><p>The most common of the ligamentous injuries is disruption of the ligaments that stabilize the lunate and scaphoid, resulting in a scapholunate dissociation. With more forceful trauma, dissociation between the lunate and the capitate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> triquetrum can occur. Diagnosis is usually made using the lateral radiograph, which in the case of a perilunate dislocation shows the lunate in normal or near normal alignment but the remainder of the carpus and metacarpals displaced dorsally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77044\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77044 \">image 9</a>), or in the case of lunate dislocation, shows the lunate displaced volarly (so-called &ldquo;spilled teacup&rdquo; sign) but the distal radius, carpus, and metacarpals in otherwise normal alignment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F97991\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97991 \">image 10</a>). The lateral wrist radiograph best confirms the injury and its direction of displacement of carpal bones, but anteroposterior (AP) and fist views may be helpful in detecting questionable cases and can suggest a higher degree ligamentous injury.

The anatomy of the wrist is complex and the differential diagnosis broad. Fortunately, patients with wrist pain generally present with one of several common combinations of symptoms and signs that suggest the diagnosis. By following the basic approach outlined here, clinicians should be able to diagnose and either manage or refer appropriately the great majority of patients with <em>acute</em> wrist complaints. <strong>Chronic</strong> and <strong>subacute</strong> causes of wrist pain are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3003375\"><span class=\"h2\">Determine whether cause is traumatic or nontraumatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in identifying the cause of acute wrist pain is to determine whether the symptoms can be traced to an episode of direct trauma to the wrist. Most often this determination is straightforward based upon the patient's history. The clinician may need to ask questions to help the patient remember details. Useful questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When did the injury or onset of pain occur?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What was the mechanism of injury? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What part of the forearm, wrist, or hand was injured?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there one spot that is most tender?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What limitations to function and activity has the wrist pain caused?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was this forearm, wrist, or hand ever injured before?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the patient note any swelling or warmth at the site of injury?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have rest or night pain, or does pain develop only with activity?</p><p/><p>The most common wrist injuries from minor trauma, usually a fall onto an outstretched hand, include fractures of the scaphoid or distal radius, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears, and ligamentous injuries. Injuries may be missed initially leading to delayed presentations. Examples of commonly missed injuries include scaphoid or hook of the hamate fractures, ligamentous injuries (eg, scapholunate), and TFCC tears. In these cases, the patient is nearly always able to localize the pain and examination reveals focal tenderness and possibly deformity. Imaging studies make or confirm the diagnosis. </p><p>The first diagnostic imaging studies obtained in most cases are standard plain radiographs. A physician with ultrasound experience often evaluates the wrist with ultrasound. Additional imaging studies may be needed depending upon the location of symptoms and the primary diagnoses being entertained. As examples, if the clinician suspects a scaphoid fracture but plain radiographs are unrevealing, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study is obtained; if a hook of the hamate fracture is suspected but plain radiographs are unremarkable, a computed tomography (CT) scan is obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3003393\"><span class=\"h2\">Determine whether nontraumatic pain is from overuse or nerve compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If no traumatic causes are identified by history, the clinician should next determine whether acute exacerbation of a more chronic condition accounts for the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. The most common causes of chronic nontraumatic wrist pain are tendon degeneration related to overuse and nerve compression. The patient may have been ignoring chronic but minor underlying wrist pain until it suddenly increased in intensity, and now presents with an &ldquo;acute&rdquo; episode.</p><p>Conditions involving tendon degeneration include extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendinopathy, intersection syndrome, de Quervain&rsquo;s tenosynovitis, and less commonly tendinopathy involving the common extensor tendons (fourth wrist compartment). Conditions related to nerve compression include carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar neuropathy (ie, Guyon&rsquo;s canal syndrome). The history and physical examination, along with a basic knowledge of wrist anatomy, are generally sufficient to diagnose these conditions. Nerve compression syndromes generally involve pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the involved nerve, whereas pain from tendon damage increases when the tendon is stressed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-basic-biomechanics-of-the-wrist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute wrist pain unrelated to overuse or nerve compression may be caused by a sudden increase in pain from conditions such as carpal boss, carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis, Kienb&ouml;ck&rsquo;s disease, and ganglion cysts. These conditions may stem from repetitive microtrauma in the past but they present months to years after any initial injury. More typically these conditions present with chronic or subacute pain, and they are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain#H5769624\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Dorsal sided wrist pain'</a>.)</p><p>Wrist pain not associated with trauma or overuse, but associated with systemic symptoms or pain in additional joints, suggests a rheumatologic, infectious, or possibly oncologic cause. General guidance about these conditions is provided above and in separate UpToDate topics devoted to these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H59023443\" class=\"local\">'Wrist pain not associated with trauma or overuse'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3003399\"><span class=\"h2\">Correlate history and location of symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most causes of acute wrist pain present at specific locations. It is important to use the location of symptoms, in addition to the information gained from the history and examination, to establish the diagnosis. Below, the common causes of acute wrist pain are organized by location and accompanied by a brief clinical description featuring elements of particular importance for diagnosis: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ulnar sided wrist pain</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendinopathy</strong> &#8210; ECU tendinopathy can develop from any repetitive motion that entails rotation or dorsiflexion of the wrist (eg, playing racquet sports, using a computer mouse). Palpation of the distal lateral wrist, resisted wrist extension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> forceful pronation of the wrist may elicit pain lateral to the ulnar styloid (over sixth wrist compartment). Ultrasound demonstrating a &ldquo;halo sign&rdquo; in compartment 6 confirms the diagnosis. Relief of pain with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> injection into the ECU sheath, if necessary, helps to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H107365946\" class=\"local\">'Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy and subluxation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Extensor carpi ulnaris subluxation</strong> &#8210; Subluxation of the ECU tendon can occur when the tendon is stressed with the wrist supinated. Patients describe the sensation of clicking or popping as the wrist is actively moved into extension and supination. They may note sharp pain with these movements. With repeated motion of the wrist from pronation and flexion to supination and extension, popping of the ECU tendon is noted lateral to ulnar styloid. A dynamic ultrasound showing the motion of the ECU tendon can confirm the diagnosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury</strong> &ndash; TFCC injury usually occurs from a fall forward onto an outstretched hand. Wrist pain directly over the ulnar aspect of ulnar-carpal joint that radiates along the ulnar aspect of the wrist is the primary symptom. Pain typically increases with any activity that requires forearm rotation and ulnar deviation of the wrist. Direct compression of the TFCC with an axial load, while the wrist is in ulnar deviation and the forearm supinated, will usually elicit significant pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirms the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H107366001\" class=\"local\">'Triangular fibrocartilage complex injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Triquetral fracture</strong> &#8210; Triquetral fractures typically occur from a hyperextension injury with the wrist in ulnar deviation. On examination, there is usually pain and point tenderness dorsally or along the ulnar border of the wrist, 1 to 2 cm distal to the most distal aspect of the ulna or the ulnar styloid. Wrist extension may reproduce or exacerbate pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triquetrum-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Triquetrum fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Ulnar styloid impaction syndrome</strong> &#8210; Ulnar styloid impingement, or impaction syndrome occurs in individuals with, an excessively long ulnar styloid, which in certain positions can cause compression of the TFCC between it and the triquetrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. These positions include repetitive flexion and ulnar deviation of the wrist while the forearm is pronated and the elbow is flexed. Maneuvers that recreate these positions and movements can be used to help diagnose the condition as well. The condition is relatively common among gymnasts. A standard posteroanterior (PA) radiograph that reveals an ulnar styloid longer than 6 mm helps to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H26911665\" class=\"local\">'Ulnar styloid impaction syndrome'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radial sided wrist pain</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Scaphoid fracture</strong> &ndash; Scaphoid fractures usually involve a history of a fall onto an outstretched hand and present with focal tenderness at the anatomic snuffbox. Tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox requires a workup to confirm or exclude scaphoid fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82858 \">picture 4</a>). Radiographs confirm the diagnosis but may be negative immediately following the fall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75655\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75655 \">image 3A</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Scapholunate instability</strong> &ndash; A fall back onto an outstretched, extended wrist can disrupt the supporting ligaments of the carpal bones, most often those that stabilize the scaphoid and lunate. Patients may complain of swelling and pain over the dorsoradial aspect of the wrist (overlying the scaphoid and lunate), grip weakness, and painful or decreased wrist motion. The scaphoid shift test and tenderness at the proximal carpal row just distal to Lister&rsquo;s tubercle are suggestive findings that indicate the need for further work-up. Plain radiographs that include a fist view help to distinguish ligamentous instability from a fracture. (See <a href=\"#H107366168\" class=\"local\">'Scapholunate instability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Trapezium fractures</strong> &ndash; Trauma involving axial loading of the thumb or a direct blow may cause a trapezium fracture. The patient typically presents with minimal swelling, but may have significant discomfort (more than expected from other carpal bone fractures). There is pain and weakness with pinching (eg, making an &quot;OK&quot; sign, or touching the thumb to the tip of the fifth digit). Pain with resisted wrist flexion from a dorsiflexed start position or tenderness at the base of the thenar eminence may indicate a fracture of the trapezial ridge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trapezium-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trapezium fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>de Quervain&rsquo;s Tenosynovitis</strong> &ndash; de Quervain's tenosynovitis usually causes distal radial-sided wrist pain that increases with ulnar deviation. Distal radial sided swelling and a positive Finkelstein test strongly suggest the diagnosis. Ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H107366242\" class=\"local\">'de Quervain&rsquo;s tenosynovitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Carpometacarpal osteoarthritis</strong> &ndash; Osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint is common in older patients and usually presents as chronic pain. However, patients can have an acute flair of this chronic condition. Symptoms often include diffuse pain focused at the base of the thumb metacarpal that is aggravated by sustained grasping or pinching (eg, when sewing) or by forceful use of the thumb (eg, turning a key). Key examination findings include some irregularity (&ldquo;squaring&rdquo;) at the CMC joint and pain referred to this area with resisted thumb flexion or extension. Plain radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80798\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80798 \">image 7</a>) or ultrasound confirms the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H107366248\" class=\"local\">'Carpometacarpal osteoarthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Volar (palmar) sided wrist pain</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hook of the hamate fracture</strong> &ndash; Fractures of the hook of the hamate often result from a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH). They may be misdiagnosed initially and often present with chronic pain localized over the hypothenar eminence; swelling may be minimal or absent. An important clinical test is for the examiner to place the PIP of their thumb on the patient&rsquo;s pisiform and flex their thumb forcefully into the palm, which generally elicits pain if a fracture is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86753\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86753 \">picture 6</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hamate-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hamate fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pisiform fracture</strong> &ndash; The pisiform is typically injured from a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) with the wrist in extension, or when the heel of the hand is used like a hammer to strike an object. When the wrist is in slight extension and the hypothenar surface sustains a forceful impact, the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon compresses the pisiform against the triquetrum. Such trauma can cause an avulsion fracture of the distal portion of the pisiform, a linear fracture, or a chondral injury to the bone&rsquo;s dorsal surface. Patients present with pain and swelling at the ulnar aspect of the volar wrist. Tenderness is present directly over the pisiform and hypothenar eminence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pisiform-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pisiform fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</strong> &ndash; Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) causes paresthesias and pain in the median nerve distribution (typically involving the thenar eminence, thumb, index, and middle fingers). Symptoms are typically worse at night. Key physical findings include positive Phalen and Tinel&rsquo;s tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68440\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68440 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58010 \">picture 8</a>). An ultrasound examination showing proximal enlargement of the median nerve before it is compressed by the trans-palmar ligament helps confirm the diagnosis. On a longitudinally oriented ultrasound scan the nerve sometimes appears to taper like an hourglass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Etiology and epidemiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Ulnar nerve compression (Guyon&rsquo;s canal syndrome)</strong> &ndash; This syndrome presents with hypothenar numbness after prolonged compression of the ulnar nerve during activities such as cycling or racquet sports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57601 \">figure 5</a>). Often the physical examination is unremarkable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulnar-neuropathy-at-the-elbow-and-wrist#H87963063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow and wrist&quot;, section on 'Ulnar neuropathy at the wrist'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dorsal sided wrist pain</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Wrist sprain</strong> &ndash; A sprained wrist involves injury to the supporting ligaments of the radiocarpal joint. Most sprains are associated with mild pain or stiffness and normal range of motion, although loss of flexion and extension can occur with more severe sprains. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Distal radius fracture</strong> &ndash; Fracture of the distal radius typically follows a fall onto an outstretched hand. It commonly occurs in young active patients and in the elderly, particularly those with osteoporosis. Swelling, deformity, and a palpable bony step-off are often present, but the extremity may appear normal. Diagnosis is generally made by plain radiograph. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-radius-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal radius fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Carpal fractures</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Capitate fracture &ndash; The patient with a capitate fracture typically presents with pain and swelling on the dorsum of the wrist or proximal hand. There is tenderness dorsally over the area of the capitate (just proximal to the third metacarpal and in line with Lister&rsquo;s tubercle). A number of mechanisms can cause capitate fracture and rarely occur in isolation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capitate-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Capitate fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Lunate fracture &ndash; Acute lunate fractures most often occur as the result of a fall onto an extended wrist or some other wrist hyperextension injury. Patients may not recall a specific traumatic incident, but typically present with pain in the wrist area that is aggravated by wrist motion or gripping. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lunate-fractures-and-perilunate-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lunate fractures and perilunate injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Trapezoid fracture &ndash; Fractures of the trapezoid generally occur with axial loading of the second (index) metacarpal, or may rarely occur secondary to direct dorsal trauma. Patients usually have some degree of swelling on the dorsum of the hand, and point tenderness dorsally just proximal to the second metacarpal base. Resisted wrist dorsiflexion may cause pain as the extensor carpi radialis inserts on the proximal aspect of the index metacarpal, which is closely fixed to the trapezoid by firm intercarpal ligamentous attachments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trapezoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trapezoid fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Perilunate and lunate dislocations</strong> &ndash; Perilunate and lunate dislocations are caused by trauma, often a fall back onto an outstretched hand with the wrist extended. Both involve significant ligamentous damage and may be associated with carpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The most common of the ligamentous injuries is a scapholunate dissociation. With more forceful trauma, dissociation between the lunate and the capitate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> triquetrum can occur. Diagnosis is usually made using the lateral radiograph, which in the case of a perilunate dislocation shows the lunate in normal or near normal alignment, but the remainder of the carpus and metacarpals displaced dorsally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77044\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77044 \">image 9</a>), or in the case of lunate dislocation shows the lunate displaced volarly (so-called &ldquo;spilled teacup&rdquo; sign) but the distal radius, carpus, and metacarpals in otherwise normal alignment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F97991\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97991 \">image 10</a>). Anteroposterior (AP) and fist views may be helpful in detecting questionable cases.

This is a chronic condition, but it can have acute exacerbations. The mechanism may involve disruption of the blood supply, possibly related to undiagnosed fractures of the lunate, repetitive trauma, or abnormal biomechanical loading of the radiocarpal joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The most common symptoms are dorsal wrist pain with mild swelling.

It is often confused with de Quervain's tenosynovitis. The distinguishing feature is the location of the pain: symptoms from de Quervain&rsquo;s develop along the radial aspect of the wrist while the most common area of discomfort from intersection syndrome is the dorsum of the wrist about 2 to 3 cm proximal to the radiocarpal joint in line with the index finger distally. (See <a href=\"#H3003001\" class=\"local\">'Intersection syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91015862\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR IMMEDIATE SURGICAL REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for immediate referral to a hand surgeon vary according to the nature of the injury and the structures involved. The basic indications for emergent (ie, immediate) referral remain unchanged and include any persistent vascular or neurologic deficit, open fracture, and the development of any significant complication, such as signs of infection.

Obtaining a clear history and correlating the history and symptom location with wrist anatomy are important elements of diagnosis. Therefore, a basic understanding of wrist anatomy and function is essential. Mechanism of injury, hand dominance, and occupation and recreational activities are among the important questions to ask as part of the history, which is described in detail in the text. Chronic conditions may masquerade as acute injuries due to a sudden increase in pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-basic-biomechanics-of-the-wrist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H107364738\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the wrist is performed systematically, and includes inspection, palpation, range of motion, and relevant special tests. It is often helpful to compare affected and unaffected wrists. In the setting of trauma, motion and strength testing may be limited. In all cases, a screening neurovascular assessment of the involved extremity should be performed.
