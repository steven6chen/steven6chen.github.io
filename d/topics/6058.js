A large symptomatic, mature collection that is abutting the stomach or duodenum (ie, distance between the pancreatic collection and the intestinal lumen is 1 cm or less) is approached by an endoscopy-guided, transmural puncture through the gastric or duodenal wall. This technique also allows placement of multiple, larger caliber stents.

It is important to discuss with the patient the potential need for additional procedures prior to the first endoscopic procedure, particularly if necrotic material is seen within the walled-off pancreatic collection on preprocedure imaging.

The 10 Fr electrosurgical device (Cystotome, Cook Medical) is a through-the-scope device with a retractable needle-knife catheter. The outer sheath of the device has a metal electrocautery ring. This system permits direct puncture followed by diathermic cautery to create an enterostomy greater than 10 Fr upon healing. There may be a large quantity of fluid released into the intestinal lumen following creation of the cystenterostomy. In patients without necrotic debris, the procedure can be completed with a single transmural stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The 19 gauge fine needle aspiration (FNA) needle is used to puncture the pancreatic fluid collection under direct visualization followed by wire placement and creation of the cystenterostomy using slim dilators or brief bursts of cautery and the needle-knife or cystotome. Fluoroscopy guidance is generally used to confirm adequate looping of the wire within the fluid collection cavity. The tract is dilated for placement of dual, double-pigtail, plastic stents, but the tract does not require dilation if a metal stent is being used.</p><p>Endoscopic ultrasound assessment of the amount of debris present in the walled-off pancreatic collection will help determine which stent and how many stents are used. Plastic, double-pigtailed stents (10 Fr.) or 10-mm fully covered metal stents can be inserted through the working channel of a therapeutic EUS scope, although in the US the latter devices are not FDA-approved for use in management of pseudocysts or walled-off pancreatic necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51572\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51572 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Turbid (necrotic) fluid suggests debris within the fluid and this can be managed with direct endoscopic debridement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> placement of a nasocystic catheter for post-procedure lavage.

A lumen-apposing, fully-covered, barbell-shaped, self-expanding metal stent (LAMS), (eg, AXIOS, Boston Scientific) is available with a luminal diameter of 10 mm or 15 mm, and if it used, endoscopic necrosectomy can be performed following stent placement after exchanging the EUS scope for a gastroscope. In addition, the LAMS delivery system has an electrocautery-enabled access catheter which provides the ability for over-the-wire or free-hand thermal puncture and stent delivery using the same sheath under EUS-guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>One potential advantage of LAMS is that fewer procedures are required to achieve resolution of walled-off pancreatic necrosis, although this may also depend on the concomitant use of percutaneous drainage catheters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114068\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114068 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In two studies of patients who underwent endoscopy-guided drainage and LAMS placement, rates of resolution of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections (ie, without additional percutaneous drainage) were 83 percent (48 of 58 patients) and 90 percent (27 of 30 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In the study of 30 patients, debridement through the LAMS was done in 11 patients (37 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>One concerning adverse event related to LAMS is the rate of bleeding. Until additional data are available, informed consent should specifically mention that bleeding risk for LAMS may be higher compared with double-pigtail plastic stents. In a study of 313 patients with walled-off pancreatic necrosis who were managed with EUS-guided debridement with stent placement (86 patients with LAMS, 106 patients with double pigtail stents and 121 patients with fully-covered, self-expandable metal stents [FC-SEMS]), the rate of bleeding in the LAMS and group was 7 percent (six patients) compared with 2 percent (two patients) in the double pigtailed stent group and 0 in the FC-SEMS group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2629030250\"><span class=\"h2\">Combining drainage procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopy-guided transmural puncture and drainage can be combined with a second drainage procedure such as endoscopy-guided transpapillary stent placement and drainage or radiology-guided percutaneous drainage.

Because of the high rate of success with EUS-guided transmural drainage alone or transpapillary stent placement alone (in well-selected patients), combined procedures should be limited to special situations such as recurrent pseudocysts or pancreatic duct strictures.

The endoscopic ultrasound scope is removed and transgastric entry is typically made with a front-viewing gastroscope. Direct necrosectomy can be performed following tract maturation (eg, after four weeks). If either a lumen-apposing, fully-covered, barbell-shaped, self-expanding metal stent or a fully covered, self-expanding metal stent has been placed, debridement can be performed during the index endoscopy, if indicated based on the degree of necrosis or infection. The necrotic material is removed using snares, nets, baskets, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> forceps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F97914\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97914 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>If extensive adherent necrotic material remains after intracavitary endoscopic debridement, repeat debridement is performed after an interval of several days to one week. It is common for patients to require multiple sessions of endoscopic debridement (median of five sessions in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]). If the patient has clinically improved (ie, no fever and improvement in abdominal pain), we manage the patient as an outpatient and will bring the patient back for endoscopic debridement sessions weekly or biweekly until the necrotic pancreatic fluid collection resolves. If the patient requires inpatient hospitalization, direct endoscopic necrosectomy is performed daily or every other day with the goal of improvement to permit outpatient management. </p><p>Efficacy of endoscopic debridement of walled-off necrosis is discussed separately.

To avoid the theoretical risk of transient biliary obstruction due to pancreatic sphincterotomy, we perform a prophylactic biliary sphincterotomy prior to stent placement, although many endoscopists proceed without performing a biliary sphincterotomy.

Depending on the degree of biliary obstruction, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement can be performed in conjunction with endoscopy-guided drainage of the pancreatic fluid collection. If the fluid collection resolves, repeat cholangiogram and removal of the biliary stent at a second ERCP is performed. Management of biliary obstruction caused by complications of chronic pancreatitis, including pancreatic pseudocyst, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of chronic pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Bile duct or duodenal obstruction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42782471\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-DRAINAGE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3927210346\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-procedure instructions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to admit a patient to the hospital following fluid collection drainage depends on endoscopist preference. For patients who are discharged from the endoscopy unit or hospital following the procedure, we advise them to promptly report symptoms such as fever or worsening abdominal pain. Possible causes include stent malfunction or an infected, loculated fluid collection, and the patient should be referred back to the interventional endoscopist for further evaluation and intervention if necessary.</p><p>We suggest clear liquids for 24 hours and then advancing to small, frequent meals containing low to moderate fat (ie, 30 to 50 grams of fat per day).

However, one study suggested that fluid collection recurrence may be reduced if the stents are left in place despite resolution of the walled-off pancreatic collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Long-term stents appear to protect against recurrence when a major pancreatic duct disruption prevents pancreatic duct drainage into the duodenum, especially if a segment of viable pancreatic tail is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The theory is that with additional time, the cystenterostomy fistulous tract matures completely and persists after eventual stent removal, allowing for ongoing drainage of pancreatic secretions.</p><p>More frequent imaging is obtained in patients who underwent necrosectomy to determine if additional debridement is needed. Additional debridement may be necessary if the patient is not improving clinically, if some necrotic material persists after initial necrosectomy, or if imaging suggests that the fluid collection is not resolving. (See <a href=\"#H2333944815\" class=\"local\">'Nonresolving fluid collections'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333944815\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonresolving fluid collections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While patients with a nonresolving pancreatic fluid collection may have a prolonged illness and hospital course, additional endoscopic intervention will often produce resolution of the fluid collection and clinical improvement. The majority of nonresolving fluid collections after endoscopy-guided drainage may be related to one or more of the following factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of single stents through small puncture sites, resulting in inadequate drainage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrotic debris or loculated fluid collections that may require more intensive endoscopic necrosectomy, additional puncture sites, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flushing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to treat underlying pancreatic ductal obstruction or fistulae</p><p/><p>In patients whose fluid collections have not resolved within four to six weeks, we typically perform repeat cystenterostomy, tract dilation and stent replacement in an attempt to achieve complete drainage with collapse of the fluid collection cavity. If there is necrotic debris, endoscopic necrosectomy may be performed at the follow-up examination (plus additional endoscopy sessions if needed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] (See <a href=\"#H3651541480\" class=\"local\">'Managing pancreatic necrosis'</a> above.)</p><p>If the fluid collection has multiple compartments or if portions are not being drained by the original cystenterostomy, additional transmural puncture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transpapillary stent placement may be required for resolution. Percutaneous drainage of a nonresolving collection may also be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis#H79109133\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis&quot;, section on 'Percutaneous catheter drainage'</a>.)</p><p>If these approaches are not successful, referral to surgery is an option for management of a nonresolving fluid collection.

Most complications can be treated medically or by repeat endoscopic therapy. Careful attention to pre-procedure imaging and to the details of the endoscopy-guided techniques can help prevent many complications. The type, frequency, and management of complications related to endoscopic-guided therapy of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Efficacy and complications&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42782509\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for walled-off pancreatic fluid collections include surgical drainage, endoscopic transmural drainage, transpapillary stent placement (for pseudocysts), and percutaneous drainage; the endoscopic approach is favored if the fluid collection is in close proximity to the lumen. (See <a href=\"#H42782409\" class=\"local\">'Choice of drainage procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with relatively small (ie, 3 cm or less) pseudocysts in communication with the main pancreatic duct, we suggest transpapillary stent placement as initial therapy. Placement of a transpapillary stent provides continuous drainage of pancreatic fluid and facilitates resolution of the pancreatic ductal disruption that is responsible for the pseudocyst. (See <a href=\"#H2260865973\" class=\"local\">'Transpapillary stenting and drainage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have a large, symptomatic walled-off pancreatic fluid collection that is compressing the stomach or duodenum, we perform transmural puncture through the gastric or duodenal wall into the cyst when there is close apposition of the fluid collection to the bowel lumen. (See <a href=\"#H42782425\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy-guided transmural drainage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For walled-off pancreatic fluid collections, endoscopic transmural drainage is the primary management approach. It is performed through the stomach or duodenum, depending on the location of the fluid collection. If necrotic material is present within the fluid collection, endoscopic necrosectomy can be performed. While successful transmural drainage of pancreatic fluid collections can be achieved, it often requires repeated endoscopies for flushing, additional tract dilation, stents, and endoscopic necrosectomy. It is important to discuss with the patient the potential for additional procedures prior to the first endoscopic procedure, particularly if necrotic material is seen within the fluid collection on preprocedure imaging. (See <a href=\"#H1290018833\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To ensure accurate identification of the puncture site and to confirm that there are no intervening structures (eg gastric varices), our approach is to use endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance to select the site and create the cystenterostomy. (See <a href=\"#H2931495\" class=\"local\">'Identifying a puncture site using EUS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to admit a patient to the hospital following fluid collection drainage depends on endoscopist preference. Patients receive a short (eg, five-day) antibiotic course with a fluoroquinolone or broader-spectrum antibiotic. If fluid obtained during the endoscopic drainage procedure is infected based on culture results, the choice of antibiotic is adjusted accordingly. In such patients, we continue antibiotic therapy for seven days. (See <a href=\"#H42782471\" class=\"local\">'Post-drainage management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who did not require debridement of necrotic material, we obtain a computed tomography scan or follow-up endoscopic ultrasound in four to six weeks and, if there is complete collapse of the fluid collection cavity, the stents are removed.
