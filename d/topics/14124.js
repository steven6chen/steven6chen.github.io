In the United States, the EMS system formally began in 1966 with passage of the National Highway Traffic Safety Act that focused on the emergency care of trauma victims from motor vehicle crashes and tied federal funding for highway construction to development of state EMS systems. </p><p>Recognizing that children have unique anatomic, physiologic, developmental, and medical needs, the federal government passed legislation in 1984 that allocated funds for the purpose of improving the system for providing EMS for children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], creating the Emergency Medical Services for Children Program (EMSC <a href=\"https://emscimprovement.center/resources/&amp;token=0YqtR9aDKTO7nCIdojnDTbdQ7sh4z2lPcIXM4oixJI6FU6s0fykAO/f4NrH1hi8a&amp;TOPIC_ID=5796\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. EMSC is a collaborative program between Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and provides funding to all 50 states and United States territories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the United States, all states have EMS legislation, providing the basis for statewide systems. However, state agencies and local jurisdictions (eg, municipalities or counties) have established local regulations regarding the extent of services that can be provided by prehospital personnel and the procedures that they may perform on children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The EMS system, prehospital personnel and their capabilities, proper preparation and equipment for prehospital care of children, and advantages and disadvantages of different modes of transport will be reviewed here. The general approach to providing online medical direction and pediatric prehospital care considerations, including management, field triage, and transport decisions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric considerations in prehospital care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of United States pediatric EMS use has been described in a nationally representative sample taken from a database of almost 111 million pediatric emergency department (ED) visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Children under the age of 19 account for approximately 27 percent of United States ED visits, and 13 percent of all EMS transports. While only 7 percent of children treated in emergency departments arrive by ambulance, they are more likely than those who arrive by other means (eg, private vehicle) to require immediate care, treatment for trauma or poisoning, and admission to the hospital ward or intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Non-white race, urban environment, and lack of insurance are associated with EMS transport in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Compared to children arriving to the emergency department by other means, those arriving by EMS are predominantly infants or adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Infants require transport most often for acute illness, ingestions, and seizures, whereas adolescents are most often transported in association with trauma (including motor vehicle crashes, suicide attempts, and assault) and alcohol and drug intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>].</p><p>Prehospital pediatric resuscitation is rare, and most often occurs in children younger than four years of age. Thus, it is important that EMS systems provide appropriately sized equipment and personnel properly trained in management of pediatric emergencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. However, the infrequency of prehospital pediatric resuscitation makes maintenance of skills challenging. As an example, of 1377 pediatric EMS transports in a Canadian system, only 2.4 percent involved life-threatening problems and very few transports involved bag-mask ventilation (0.3 percent), endotracheal intubation (0.1 percent), or administration of intravenous medications (1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF THE LAYPERSON</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prehospital care of an injured or ill child is initiated by those who are present at the time of injury or acute illness, the &quot;bystanders.&quot; They are the ones who access the EMS system and begin life-saving interventions, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until EMS arrival. </p><p>With involvement of the layperson, the crucial time between a life-threatening illness or injury and institution of emergency medical management can be reduced. Specific examples of the important role of bystanders include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of bystander involvement in witnessed cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. In fact, with the introduction of automated external defibrillators (AEDs), the role of the layperson has expanded beyond CPR into the management of ventricular fibrillation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bystander intervention has been effective for removing a foreign body from the airway. In a study that compared bystander intervention with EMS intervention for the management of 103 children (aged 0 to 15 years) with foreign bodies in the airway, the airways were cleared before EMS arrival in 85 percent of the children, either by a bystander (47 percent) or the child (38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These findings support the AAP recommendation that new parents and other laypersons who care for children (eg, teachers, day care providers) be trained in CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">THE EMS SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common method of requesting EMS transport in the United States and Canada is via the 911 system. As a general rule, access to 911 is provided to the consumer through the local telephone service and routed to public safety answering points (PSAPs). The city or local community contracts with an EMS service to provide medical response and transport to 911 callers. However, 911 is not a universal emergency telephone number in other countries. As an example, 112 is the common emergency medical call number for European Union countries while 000 is used in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>Most emergency medical systems employ some version of enhanced 911, which provides the name, address, and phone number of the individual whose phone is used to place the emergency call. When cellular telephones are used to place 911 calls, the address and phone number that are provided to the PSAP point the dispatcher to the cellular telephone company, not to the caller. This problem is being addressed through the use of satellites that can pinpoint the exact location of the cellular telephone caller.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of EMS systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several types of EMS systems exist, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The three most common types are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>City or county</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Private</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volunteer</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">City/county (regional)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">city/county</span> type of EMS system is operated by the city, county, or regional government and usually is integrated into the fire department. Most commonly, the fire chief has significant control of the EMS division (which may be shared with the EMS medical director). Regional systems often are funded by the local municipality, providing at least a theoretical guarantee of service to the taxpayer. Higher than average salaries and benefits often result in the retention of experienced personnel. In addition, most police and fire departments are administrated through a municipal or county system, which allows for an integrated dispatch system that can be used by police, fire, and EMS. Such an integrated system can help coordinate the effort during an emergency. The disadvantages of the regional system include potential budgetary concerns and delays because of governmental bureaucracy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Private</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Private ambulance companies operate in urban, suburban, and rural communities. In some cities or counties, private companies provide 911 access, and in others, they have partnership agreements with the city or county EMS systems. As an example, the city may provide 911 service to the community, whereas the private ambulance company performs all interfacility transports. A private company seldom operates 911 access if a city or county EMS system is already in existence. Cooperation among private companies is rare, and competition may be present. Salaries usually are based upon hourly wages, and job turnover is a frequent problem. Although the emergency medical technicians (EMTs) practice under the medical director's license, most patient care is predetermined by protocols, rather than by direct contact with a physician. Although this is also true for some <span class=\"nowrap\">city/county</span> EMS systems, it is more common among the privately run systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Volunteer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rural communities, 911 access often is contracted to volunteers. Because many volunteer prehospital providers have a personal interest in EMS, their level of training usually is equal to or greater than that of the EMTs in municipal and private systems. However, their experience and training may be limited unless they have opportunities to gain experience at second jobs or via larger EMS systems in neighboring communities. In volunteer systems, particularly in rural areas, the distance between hospitals may be great, transportation times prolonged, and the scope of practice necessarily broad. Medical direction often is limited, and protocols commonly are employed to assist the EMT with patient care. Problems may arise as a result of budgetary constraints because funding typically is limited in rural communities. </p><p>The Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP), a division of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), provides a number of resources for rural communities in recognition of their unique EMS needs and challenges (<a href=\"http://www.hrsa.gov/ruralhealth&amp;token=Avgmwaq5aLk79THpXqFRKM8Ty4B3eWDL/ddrrPr7u9vv9h3vFlpYMB6X5nQXOBsj&amp;TOPIC_ID=5796\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.hrsa.gov/ruralhealth</a>).</p><p>Pediatric healthcare providers can play an important role in the development, implementation, and supervision of EMS for children in rural communities as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide education about pediatric issues from prevention to rehabilitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assist with protocol writing, hospital care, and pediatric data accumulation and interpretation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assure appropriate pediatric resuscitation equipment is available in physician offices, transport vehicles, and receiving facilities.

However, less than half of the world&rsquo;s countries have a formal EMS system in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. If EMS exists in many poorer countries, these systems typically focus on trauma care. Implementation of an integrated trauma system has been shown to decrease mortality 15 to 20 percent in high-income Western nations, and prehospital trauma life support programs in low and middle-income countries improve survival rates by decreasing out-of-hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>In the developed world, despite national differences in organization and funding of comprehensive EMS systems, two main models for the delivery of prehospital care have emerged with distinct characteristics. The Anglo-American model (typified by the United States and British EMS systems but also used by South Africa and Canada) centers around the philosophy of rapid transport to definitive care. There is limited emphasis on interventions prehospital. Systems developed around the Anglo-American model are frequently associated with public safety (eg, fire departments), and care is provided by EMTs with medical oversight. In general, countries with this strategy have a well-developed specialty of emergency medicine and patients are transported directly to emergency departments for further stabilization and definitive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. </p><p>By contrast, the Franco-German model of EMS (used by countries including France, Germany, Greece, Austria, the Nordic Countries, and Malta) focuses on scene-based stabilization and treatment. Rather than the notion of bringing the patient to the hospital, this model essentially brings the hospital to the patient. In order to accomplish this, physicians are key members of the EMS team and have the authority to provide advanced care and determine disposition in the field. These systems are usually associated with the larger health system rather than public safety. After field treatment, patients may remain at home or if further hospital care (inpatient) is needed, be transported directly to hospital wards rather than emergency departments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/27,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31,32</a>]. </p><p>An emerging model of EMS care being explored in the United Kingdom is that of the Emergency Care Practitioner (ECP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. According to the National Health Service, an ECP is an allied health professional with special training who functions with significant autonomy and is capable of providing prehospital emergency care as well as community-based primary care. This model of EMS delivery is currently under consideration in other countries, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365214\"><span class=\"h1\">DISPATCH PERSONNEL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dispatch operations vary widely depending upon the EMS system and the city, county, or state in which it operates. For the purpose of this discussion, central dispatch, one of the most common methods of dispatch, will be used as the prototype.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the EMS system (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">city/county,</span> private, or volunteer) to assign personnel to central dispatch. As a general rule, all 911 calls go through central dispatch, where select personnel forward calls to the appropriate location based upon the caller's request. As an example, when a 911 call is received, the individual who receives it determines if the call is for fire, police, or EMS. If the call is for EMS, it is forwarded to trained personnel who will gather the necessary information from the caller and dispatch personnel to the scene <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> offer advice to the caller.</p><p>Most dispatch systems use some form of computer-aided protocols, which are updated on a continuous basis. Each question on the protocol must be answered before the next question appears on the computer monitor. When a caller requests an ambulance, for example, they may be asked &quot;Is the victim breathing?&quot; The caller must respond before the dispatcher can move to the next step in the protocol. The protocol questions proceed through the airway, breathing, and circulation guidelines of BLS. From the information that is obtained, the dispatcher determines the type of unit (ALS or BLS, see below) to be dispatched and what advice should be given to the caller. For critical cases, the dispatcher may remain on the line until EMS personnel arrive on scene.</p><p>First responders are frequently dispatched to the scene, regardless of the level of emergency. If the injury or illness appears life-threatening, additional advanced trained personnel are dispatched, and the first responder remains at the scene to assist with the rescue. Once the EMS personnel arrive at the scene, radio or cell phone contact with the base station usually is attempted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365267\"><span class=\"h2\">Base station personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The base station typically is staffed with EMS providers who have advanced training and experience. They help the field personnel with decision-making and provide additional medical direction. Medical direction is provided by base station personnel in a variety of ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Off-line medical direction refers to protocols that have been created by physicians and EMS providers for use by the field personnel, in the absence of active physician direction. Many pediatric prehospital protocols exist but may vary from region to region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In the United States, national model pediatric prehospital protocols have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, adoption is voluntary and has not occurred in many jurisdictions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care#H7779305\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric considerations in prehospital care&quot;, section on 'Offline medical control'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On-line medical direction implies immediate medical assistance with each call. An example of on-line medical control would be a base station, located in a Level 1 trauma center, which is answered by nurses or physicians 24 hours per day, seven days per week. In one retrospective review, online medical direction improved the appropriateness of vascular access and cardiac monitoring in children with respiratory illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

These individuals usually are paramedics who have years of field experience and have furthered their education in patient care. The EMS system is extremely dependent upon these individuals, and the quality of care provided to the community often is a reflection of their direction and level of expertise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365281\"><span class=\"h2\">EMS direction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each state designates an EMS director whose office is responsible for credentialing the state's EMS systems and personnel. In addition, individual EMS systems are directed medically by a local physician who oversees the practice of his or her EMS personnel. The EMS personnel operate under the medical license of the medical director, whose directive can either limit or expand their scope of practice. The credentials and experience of the medical director depend on the availability of resources. A large urban EMS system may have an affiliation with a local academic institution that is willing to provide financial or personnel assistance. In fact, several systems have both an adult and a pediatric medical director, in sharp contrast to many rural communities that may have to share the resources of one medical director.</p><p>The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has recognized EMS as a medical subspecialty and has developed requirements and core content for programs seeking accreditation through the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSPORT PERSONNEL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some countries, such as France, Germany, and Italy, prehospital advanced life support is provided by or under the direct supervision of a physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Funding for the development of a national EMS curriculum, including didactic education, skills laboratory, clinical education, field internship, continuing education, and recertification, was provided by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The curricula for the various providers were completed between 1994 and 1999, and most states require that they be used in the training of EMS personnel. Recommended minimum training requirements of the various personnel include: approximately 40 hours for first responder, 110 hours for EMT-B, 800 to 100 hours for EMT-I, and 1000 to 1200 hours for EMT-P.</p><p>More recently, the NHTSA and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) convened a multidisciplinary task force to develop a comprehensive national system to maximize efficiency, consistency and quality of instruction, and student competence consisting of five components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>EMS Core Content</strong> &ndash; A comprehensive list of the domains of knowledge and skills necessary to provide out-of-hospital emergency medical care; defines the universe of EMS knowledge and skills.

Continuing education requirements for recertification also vary widely from state-to-state. </p><p>Of note, most systems require that their EMT-Paramedic (EMT-P) personnel have at least 10 percent of their training in pediatrics. Some systems rely on the Pediatric Advanced Life Support course (PALS) for their pediatric education, whereas others create their own educational experience in pediatrics. Instead of PALS, some systems use The Pediatric Education for Prehospital Professionals (PEPP) course for pediatric education. PEPP is a two-day program available to both the basic and advanced prehospital provider (<a href=\"http://www.peppsite.com/&amp;token=jc3SKr4sVgyEWB4Td3cb58W7ovHZqymEXMROTZ5H04OvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=5796\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.peppsite.com/</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Scope of practice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The scope of practice for first responders, Emergency Medical Technician-Basic (EMT-B), Emergency Medical Technician-Intermediate (EMT-I), and Emergency Medical Technician-Paramedic (EMT-P) are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78718 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83593 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">First responders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first responder, by definition, is the first EMS provider to arrive on the scene. His or her presence in an EMS system, however, often depends on the resources of the community. In the new United States EMS scope of practice model, first responders will be replaced with the designation Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) although the practice model remains the same. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Education'</a> above.) </p><p>The role of these providers is to initiate immediate basic life-saving care to critical patients with minimal equipment while awaiting further EMS response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83593 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These providers often are firefighters on ladder and pumper trucks or police, who arrive at the scene early and begin the initial management. Most cities have more firefighters than EMS providers and fewer fires than medical emergencies. As a result, EMS systems have started to capitalize on the availability of fire personnel and have begun to introduce them to patient care. In one prospective, multi-center study of adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the use of first-responders shortened the time to definitive intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Such studies have not been performed in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">EMT-Basic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The EMT-Basic (EMT-B) also is referred to as Basic or basic life support (BLS). EMT-Bs will be replaced with the designation Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in the new United States scope of practice model. They provide basic emergency medical care and transportation and perform interventions with basic equipment. The scope of practice of EMT-Bs is broader than first responders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83593 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, EMT-Bs are <strong>not</strong> trained in endotracheal tube or intravenous (IV) placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>EMT-Bs are the major labor force of the EMS system. They provide transport for patients with most minor illnesses and injuries and depending on the community, may be responsible for the transport of Level 1 (moderate to severe) trauma patients. EMT-Bs can transport Level 1 trauma patients if the scene is close to a Level 1 trauma center. In such circumstances, the patient's airway and spine are stabilized at the scene and he or she is transported to the nearest trauma center without delay; major management is deferred until arrival at the hospital. This type of transport is known as &quot;load and go.&quot; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">EMT-Intermediate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The scope of practice for the EMT-Intermediate (EMT-I) is similar to that of the EMT-P (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83593 \">table 2</a>). Although the United States National Standardized Curriculum recommends four levels of training, the EMT-I has been less widely accepted than has the EMT-B or paramedic. Many states and local governments have difficulty placing EMT-I in the larger scheme of prehospital care. States often permit them to certify as EMT-I, only to have local governments limit their scope of practice to that of the EMT-B because the local government recognizes only the EMT-B and the paramedic.</p><p>The designation of Advanced Emergency Medical Technician (AEMT) will replace EMT-I in the new Scope of Practice Model. AEMTs will provide basic and limited advanced emergency care and transport. Skills include suctioning of the intubated patient, physical assessment, and a number of procedures, such as placement of intravenous or intraosseous access and administration of fluids and a limited number of medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">EMT-Paramedic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The EMT-Paramedic (EMT-P) also is referred to as EMT-Advanced (EMT-A) and advanced life support (ALS). The scope of practice of the paramedic includes that of the EMT-B, as well as airway management, intravenous and intraosseous access, cardiac life support, administration of system specific and approved medications, advanced triage, and advanced newborn resuscitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78718 \">table 1</a>). The new Scope of Practice Model does not significantly change the skills required of paramedics in the current system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION AND EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparation is essential to assuring fast and appropriate patient care during an emergency. Response and transport personnel always should be ready for a pediatric emergency. The response and transport personnel who are dispatched should rehearse mock scenarios and prepare their equipment en route to the scene. Proper equipment and thoughtful preparation increase the likelihood of a good outcome.</p><p>In addition to the standard equipment and supplies determined by governmental agencies (eg, those needed for safe extrication of patients), there are guidelines for pediatric equipment and supplies for both basic and advanced life support ambulances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82004 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59854 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A length-based pediatric emergency measuring tape or a reference that guides pediatric drug dosing and equipment sizing based upon length or age should be available on every vehicle. The measuring tape provides a rapid estimate of a child's weight from the recumbent length and correlates the child's size with appropriate sizes of emergency equipment and doses for emergency medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">AIR VERSUS GROUND TRANSPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to transport a child by air or ground depends upon the condition of the child, the severity of the emergency condition, the type and location of the emergency facility, local resources, safety, the pediatric medical skill set of the potential providers, and weather conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As a general rule, ground transport is more readily available if an emergency facility is within 20 to 30 minutes of the scene, and air transport is better if there is rough terrain or a long distance between the scene and the emergency facility. Sometimes a combination of air and ground transport is used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Ground transportation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ambulances used for ground transportation are categorized according to their equipment and staffing as basic life support (BLS) vehicles or advanced life support (ALS) vehicles. BLS vehicles should carry (at minimum) the equipment identified by the American College of Surgeons as essential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82004 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The staffing varies, but BLS units usually have at least two persons trained to the level of EMT-B. ALS vehicles should have at least one paramedic on board. In addition to meeting the standards for BLS vehicles, ALS vehicles should have intubation and vascular access equipment, a portable battery operated monitor-defibrillator, and a variety of medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59854 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>An ALS response is required if the child has a life-threatening problem, alteration of consciousness, or respiratory distress, or potentially requires airway management or vascular access. A BLS response may be more appropriate and expeditious for limb-threatening problems and those requiring first-aid, immobilization, oxygen administration, and immediate transport (eg, &quot;load and go&quot;). All other problems may receive a less acute mode of transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Air transportation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Air transportation, which requires specialized equipment and staffing, can occur via helicopter or fixed-wing planes. Helicopters are used more often in densely populated areas; they have the advantage of rapid, direct access to the scene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, helicopters can provide ALS services to large, rural areas that are unable to sustain independent ALS units. Helicopter response teams usually are reserved for short-range transports and those instances in which ground transport would result in unacceptable delays. The teams that operate helicopter transports often are comprised of paramedics, nurses, and occasionally, physicians who are trained and experienced in the delivery of advanced cardiac life support.</p><p>Fixed-wing vehicles provide smoother, quieter, faster, and more spacious transportation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, because they require a runway for take-off and landing, they are not capable of providing direct scene access. If distances between referral hospitals are greater than 150 miles, the patient probably should be transported by fixed-wing aircraft. Most tertiary pediatric care facilities offer fixed-wing transports through leasing agreements with local airports or airline companies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Special considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During air transportation of sick neonates and children the effects of hypoxemia, gravitational forces, expansion of trapped gases, and decreased temperature and humidity must be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate oxygenation is best assessed with continuous pulse oximetry and adjustment of fractional inspired oxygenation concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The expansion of gases trapped in body cavities may have adverse consequences (eg, pneumothorax) if this effect of altitude is not anticipated and managed (eg, by air venting or use of pressurized cabins).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temperature regulation should be maintained since hypothermia and shivering increase oxygen consumption and may aggravate metabolic derangements (eg, acidosis, hypoglycemia).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of humidity can facilitate temperature control and fluid balance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giving attention to quality improvement (QI) programs and safety is essential to providing good patient care. Most EMS systems have some form of QI built into their program. Quality improvement programs are particularly important when instituting new or controversial procedures (eg, endotracheal intubation) into the paramedic's scope of practice. As an example, one controlled clinical trial indicated that the addition of endotracheal intubation to a paramedic scope of practice that already included bag mask ventilation did not alter survival or neurologic outcomes of children undergoing short transport times to definitive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The study also demonstrated that mortal complications of intubation (eg, esophageal intubation, unrecognized dislodgement of the endotracheal tube) occurred in 8 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, the risks of endotracheal intubation in some EMS systems may outweigh the benefits of intubation that have been identified in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Monitoring outcomes when procedures or policies are changed is necessary to determine whether such procedures or policies are successful and is essential to providing optimal patient care and safety. A key aspect of monitoring is detailed assessment of adverse events and near-misses to determine root causes and effective strategies for prevention. As an example, a small observational study of adverse events and near-misses in pediatric prehospital care identified the following key issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress and anxiety caused by decreased experience with pediatric patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate training and experience in managing children in the prehospital environment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concern about causing pain or harm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Predominance of errors of omission (failure to act when it is indicated) over errors of commission (performing the procedure incorrectly or doing the wrong intervention)</p><p/><p>Delineation of the epidemiology of errors and near misses related to the prehospital care of children remains an area of emerging interest and few data exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>]. An excellent guide to quality improvement for emergency medical service systems is available <a href=\"http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/20000/20700/20758/PB98145899.pdf&amp;token=xvzgWuSgtEnP3G9PPvaWxCg6kWixjG3HfV2KWf8F+ZGrP6aHPLod2NjkV8/vugB4tZmCKhyMI/u1/PZAJRhhOw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5796\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">here</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSPORT REFUSAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Refusal of transport by a legal guardian or a prehospital provider is an important occurrence that should be addressed with standard policies and procedures and according to the laws of the jurisdiction. Transport refusal is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care#H1565379\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric considerations in prehospital care&quot;, section on 'Transport refusal by legal guardian'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-considerations-in-prehospital-care#H2111936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric considerations in prehospital care&quot;, section on 'Decision not to transport'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10751377\"><span class=\"h1\">INTER-FACILITY TRANSPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, preparation is essential to good patient care. Although most hospitals are not expected to provide tertiary pediatric care, they should be prepared to stabilize infants and children who present for care. That preparation includes having a prearranged transfer agreement that identifies the preferred tertiary pediatric care facility, mode of transport, and method of contact and a similar agreement with an EMS provider. In some situations the transport service is provided through the municipal EMS service; more commonly, the contract is assigned to a private company or hospital transport service. Large tertiary care facilities may operate their own ambulance service, including air transport, or contract the service with a private EMS company. Resources for interfacility transfer of children are available through the Emergency Medical Services for Children National Resource Center on its <a href=\"https://emscimprovement.center/resources/&amp;token=0YqtR9aDKTO7nCIdojnDTbdQ7sh4z2lPcIXM4oixJI6FU6s0fykAO/f4NrH1hi8a&amp;TOPIC_ID=5796\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p>Use of a pediatric specialized team is associated with improved survival and fewer adverse events during transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. The use of pediatric specialized teams is recommended whenever it is available. For example, an observational study of adverse events and mortality occurring during interfacility transports, involving 1085 infants and children (1021 transported by a pediatric team and 64 transported by a nonspecialized team), reported an overall frequency of 64 unplanned adverse events (UAE) experienced by 55 children (5 percent of all patients) and 117 deaths (10 percent of all patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/56,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,59</a>]. Medical control was provided by the same group of pediatric critical care specialists for all transports. The risk of UAE was much higher for children transported by a nonspecialized team versus a pediatric team (20 percent versus 0.5 percent; adjusted relative risk [RR] 246, 95 % CI: 76-796). In addition, mortality was greater among children transported by a nonspecialized team than by a pediatric team (23 percent [15 patients] versus 9 percent [92 patients]; adjusted RR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.1-5.3). In this study, for every seven transports by a nonspecialized team, approximately one unexpected death occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. These differences in unexpected outcomes during transport occurred despite a significantly longer transport time for the pediatric team versus the nonspecialized team (mean time 113 minutes versus 81 minutes, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>The most common scenario that leads to an inter-facility transport involves the critically ill neonate, infant, or child who requires services not available at the transferring facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Depending upon the severity of the child's illness or injury, the receiving hospital may choose to send a critical care transport team to pick up the child. In such a situation, the receiving hospital usually provides advice to the referring hospital awaiting the transport team's arrival.</p><p>Stabilizing the critically ill or injured patient before transfer is necessary to assure a good patient outcome. Crucial stabilization and management interventions should not wait for arrival of a pediatric transport team but should be identified and performed with assistance and off site direction from a pediatric transport medical command physician.</p><p>Most tertiary pediatric care facilities send a critical care transport team to the referring facility and attempt to stabilize the patient at the referring facility before performing the transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Tertiary pediatric care facilities often have a critical care response team(s) available. These are often limited resources, however, and may not always be immediately available. The personnel that comprise the hospital transport team usually include a combination of two or more of the following transport trained providers (physician, nurse or paramedic, respiratory therapist). Most personnel are certified in pediatric advanced life support and often are staff members of the emergency department, pediatric intensive care unit, or neonatal intensive care unit.</p><p>Other circumstances that may result in an inter-facility transport include those initiated at the family's request or in accordance with insurance contract requirements. In these cases, involving the critical care transport team may not be necessary, and an EMS service with properly trained personnel can often fulfill the need.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H799260743\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'The EMS system'</a> above and <a href=\"#H365214\" class=\"local\">'Dispatch personnel'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Transport personnel'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Globally, EMS systems are rudimentary in impoverished countries. In wealthier nations, variable organization and funding strategies primarily focus around one of two delivery strategies: &ldquo;scoop and run,&rdquo; as exemplified by the Anglo-American model; and &ldquo;stay and treat,&rdquo; typified by the Franco-German model. The former relies on care provided by providers who are not physicians with medical oversight while the latter provides on-site care by trained physicians. (See <a href=\"#H10749933\" class=\"local\">'International EMS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the organization of EMS occurs at the local and state levels with federal support from multiple agencies that provide limited funding for each state system as well as research funds targeting EMS issues. Considerable variation in prehospital provider training, certification, licensure, and continuing education as well as scope of practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78718 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83593 \">table 2</a>) currently exists, though federal efforts are underway to establish national standards.

In addition to the standard equipment and supplies determined by governmental agencies (eg, those needed for safe extrication of patients), there are guidelines for pediatric equipment and supplies for both basic and advanced life support ambulances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82004 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59854 \">table 4</a>).

Ground transport is more readily available if an emergency facility is within 20 to 30 minutes of the scene, and air transport is better if there is rough terrain or a long distance between the scene or transferring facility and the receiving facility. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Air versus ground transport'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During inter-facility transport, use of a pediatric specialized team is associated with significantly improved survival and fewer adverse events. Thus, whenever possible, a pediatric transport team should be used for interfacility transportation of critically ill or injured children. (See <a href=\"#H10751377\" class=\"local\">'Inter-facility transport'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prehospital-pediatrics-and-emergency-medical-services-ems/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Skandalakis PN, Lainas P, Zoras O, et al. &quot;To afford the wounded speedy assistance&quot;: Dominique Jean Larrey and Napoleon.
