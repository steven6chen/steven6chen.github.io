Acute complications occur as a direct result of the trauma sustained and can include damage to vascular structures, nerves, or soft tissue. Delayed complications may occur after initial treatment or in response to treatment. Therefore, reevaluation at regular intervals during healing is prudent in most cases.</p><p>Major acute and long-term complications of fractures are described here. The management of specific fractures and some specific complications are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66786302\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain fractures can cause severe hemorrhage or predispose to other life-threatening complications. Femur fractures that disrupt the femoral artery or its branches are potentially fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pelvic fractures can damage pelvic arteries or veins causing life-threatening hemorrhage; the more displaced the pelvic fracture, the greater the potential blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hip fractures, particularly in the elderly, may prevent ambulation, resulting in potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia, thromboembolic disease, and possibly rhabdomyolysis, if there is a prolonged period of immobility. Patients with multiple rib fractures are at substantial risk for pulmonary contusion and related complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midshaft-femur-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Midshaft femur fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hip fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-rib-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9054405\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66786309\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper fracture healing requires adequate blood supply to the injured site. However, fractures can involve sharp bone fragments that injure adjacent arteries, causing hemorrhage and possibly disruption of distal blood supply to a limb, and potentially impairing bone healing. Certain fractures are associated with particular arterial injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61068\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61068 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In all cases, the distal and proximal pulses of any fractured extremity should be examined to determine the adequacy of arterial flow. Immediate reduction and immobilization is required for any fracture associated with neurovascular compromise. A detailed examination of the extremity should be documented at the initial presentation so that changes in the neurovascular status can be recognized. </p><p>In cases of high-velocity trauma, angiography may be needed to define vascular injury, as the presence of distal pulses does not always indicate intact proximal arteries. Signs of disrupted arterial flow may include a cool extremity, mottled skin color, and loss of sensation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Arterial disruption can occur with fractures in the region of the elbow or knee. Fractures around the elbow without distal pulses but with a warm hand demonstrating good capillary refill warrant orthopedic consultation but can generally be observed. Conversely, fractures around the knee without distal palpable pulses are considered a surgical emergency and the surrounding vascular anatomy should be evaluated emergently with diagnostic imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66786316\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerves are susceptible to damage from fracture fragments acutely but can also be injured during treatment from complications of casting or by excessive callus formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Compression'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Transection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Compression'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Transection'</a>.)</p><p>Certain nerves are particularly susceptible to injury because of their proximity to common fracture sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61068\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61068 \">table 1</a>). As an example, the median nerve is often injured in association with distal radius fractures. The reported incidence of this complication is up to 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The mechanism for median nerve injury can involve stretching of the nerve due to fracture fragment displacement, or possibly swelling around the distal radius or excessive wrist flexion of the cast, both of which increase pressure within the carpal tunnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Humeral shaft fractures are commonly associated with radial nerve injury, manifested by loss of the ability to extend the wrist and fingers. This can be seen on presentation or after splinting. Most often, no intervention other than observation is necessary and the injury eventually resolves with time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-radius-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal radius fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midshaft-humeral-fractures-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Midshaft humeral fractures in adults&quot;, section on 'Radial nerve injury'</a>.)</p><p>With any extremity fracture, sensory and motor function should be examined at the time of presentation. Pain often limits the initial evaluation and adequate analgesia must be provided. Immediate reduction and immobilization is required for any fracture associated with neurovascular or skin compromise.</p><p>Complete or partial nerve transection, or excessive nerve stretch or compression, from fracture fragments or the force of the initial trauma can lead to chronic nerve injury. Nerve injury that is not present initially but presents after immobilization can be caused by excessive pressure from the cast or splint, or from stretching of the nerve from abnormal positioning during immobilization. Generally, such delayed injuries result in neurapraxia, in that the nerve fibers are not permanently damaged, but physiologically the nerve signal is interrupted. Transient neurapraxia generally resolves by two to three months with proper treatment, which includes ensuring that the nerve is allowed to heal without stretching or prolonged compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Reexamination following immobilization to characterize any residual deficits is essential and should be documented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66786323\"><span class=\"h2\">Compartment syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The muscle groups of human limbs are divided into sections, or compartments, formed by strong, potentially unyielding, fascial membranes. Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) occurs when increased pressure within a compartment compromises the circulation and function of tissues within that space. With fractures, bleeding or swelling within a fascial compartment creates the increased pressure. ACS is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Long bone fractures are the injuries most commonly associated with ACS, particularly fractures of the tibia, distal radius, supracondylar area of the humerus, and occasionally the femur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107752 \">table 2</a>). In addition to excessive intracompartmental fluid, ACS can also be caused by casts or bandaging that limits the space available for soft tissue swelling. </p><p>Early recognition of ACS and immediate fasciotomy may be limb sparing. Early symptoms and signs can include pain out of proportion to the apparent injury, persistent deep ache or burning pain, paresthesias, and pain with passive stretching of muscles in the affected compartment. When ACS is recognized, any circumferential cast, splint, or bandage should be loosened or cut to decrease the intracompartmental pressure, and orthopedic surgery consultation obtained immediately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66786330\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboembolic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major orthopedic trauma substantially increases the risk for venous thrombosis and its sequelae (eg, pulmonary embolism) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107752 \">table 2</a>). Therefore, patients hospitalized with major fractures receive prophylactic treatment to prevent the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Although minor fractures are associated with an increased risk for DVT, thromboprophylaxis is typically not indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;, section on 'Surgical risk groups'</a>.)</p><p>Given the increased risk for DVT associated with trauma, imaging studies are needed to assess fracture patients with suggestive clinical findings. The diagnosis and management of DVT is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Trauma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9054368\"><span class=\"h2\">Fat embolism syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a difficult diagnosis associated with closed long bone fractures of the lower extremity, most commonly involving the femoral shaft. FES typically manifests 24 to 72 hours after injury with dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Neurologic abnormalities and a petechial rash may be present. Severe respiratory distress and death can occur. FES is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fat-embolism-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fat embolism syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66786337\"><span class=\"h2\">Open fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open fractures are those with direct communication between the fracture and the environment due to traumatic disruption of the intervening soft tissue and skin. Open fractures have a higher incidence of infection than closed fractures. Up to 10 percent of open fractures may still develop acute compartment syndrome as the open wound may not decompress all affected compartments in the limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of open fractures depends to some degree upon the extent of soft tissue damage, the degree of wound contamination, and the underlying health of the patient. All open fractures receive the following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immobilization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetanus prophylaxis as indicated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesia as needed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prompt irrigation and debridement</p><p/><p>Irrigation of an open wound using a sterile isotonic saline solution and low pressure is a sound approach. According to an international, blinded, randomized trial involving 2447 patients, no improvement in outcome was noted when either higher pressure irrigation or a soap solution was used to clean open fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury#H909588585\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of severe extremity injury&quot;, section on 'Debridement and stabilization'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, early wound closure reduces infection risk and is performed whenever possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The pathogens and antibiotics used for prophylaxis against open fracture infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Classification systems have been developed to determine the risk of infection in open fractures. Risk increases in correlation with the size of the wound, severity of soft tissue and bone damage, degree of contamination, and whether wound coverage is adequate. The most commonly used classification system is described in the attached table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72480 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]: </p><p>In addition to fracture characteristics, the number and severity of patient comorbidities also increases the risk of infection. Host factors associated with infection and compromised wound healing include age &ge;80 years, nicotine use, diabetes, active malignancy, pulmonary insufficiency, and immunocompromised states. The following infection rates have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class A (no comorbid factors): 4 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class B (1 to 2 comorbid factors): 15 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class C (3 or more comorbid factors): 31 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2866952\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture blisters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blisters can develop over the site of traumatic fractures, usually in areas where the skin is significantly swollen or the soft tissue is injured. They typically develop within the first one or two days after the acute trauma. Blisters are filled with either clear fluid (partial thickness skin injury) or blood (full thickness, hemorrhagic injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most common locations for fracture blisters are over the tibia, ankle, and elbow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p>In a retrospective series of 53 fracture blisters associated with trauma, patients who had surgery within four hours after their acute injury had the lowest incidence of blister formation (2 percent), while the highest incidence was reported among those whose surgery was delayed over 24 hours (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When fracture blisters were present before surgery, wound complications (eg, post-operative wound infections) developed at a higher rate. Fifteen of the blisters in this series were found to have sterile, transudative fluid in subepidermal vesicles. When blisters ruptured, the wound was contaminated by skin flora in all 11 cases. </p><p>Fracture blisters should not be disrupted if at all possible. Once disrupted, they can become infected with skin flora. Disrupted blisters may do better if an ointment such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver sulfadiazine</a> is applied to promote re-epithelialization and to prevent infection or by leaving the blistered skin on as a biologic dressing after the blister has drained. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9054628\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-ACUTE COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66786344\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteomyelitis is infection localized to bone. Trauma, including fractures, is one of several possible causes. Osteomyelitis is discussed in detail separately; aspects of particular relevance to fractures are described here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Post-traumatic osteomyelitis accounts for up to 47 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Open fractures are at greater risk, with infection rates reported to range from 2 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/8,10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,17</a>]. The extent of soft tissue injury at presentation appears to be the most significant risk factor. With open fractures, copious irrigation and fracture stabilization are important for reducing the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Acute osteomyelitis usually presents with gradual progression of dull localized pain over several days. Local findings (tenderness, warmth, erythema, swelling) and systemic symptoms (fever, rigors) may be present. Decreased range of motion, point tenderness, and joint effusions may be seen but are also present with uninfected fractures, making clinical diagnosis potentially difficult.</p><p>In some cases, osteomyelitis presents with few symptoms or signs. This is more common with subacute or chronic infections, with infections of the hip, pelvis, or vertebrae, and in young patients. Chronic osteomyelitis may present with pain, erythema, or swelling, sometimes in association with a draining sinus tract. Fractures that are healing slower than expected or that remain extremely painful despite adequate immobilization may be complicated by osteomyelitis. Intravenous antibiotics and surgical debridement are the mainstays of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21949930\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonunion and malunion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incomplete healing of a fracture where the cortices of the bone fragments do not reconnect is called a nonunion. When a fracture heals with a deformity (eg, angulation, rotation, incongruent joint surface), this is called a malunion. A subset of fractures is more susceptible to these complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107752 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Nonunions commonly present with persistent pain, swelling, or instability beyond the time when healing should normally have occurred. In most cases, symptomatic nonunions are treated with open reduction and fixation. Some nonunions are asymptomatic and treatment is unnecessary. An example of such a nonunion is spondylolysis of the lumbar pars interarticularis, where a fibrous union can provide sufficient stability and often forms without causing persistent symptoms. </p><p>Common reasons for nonunion and malunion include a tenuous blood supply to the fractured bone (eg, scaphoid, proximal fifth metatarsal, talar neck), behaviors that interfere with bone healing (eg, smoking, chronic alcohol abuse), poor bone fixation (ie, excessive movement at the fracture site), poor apposition of bone fragments (ie, fragment ends too far from one another), and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Fractures sustained during high energy trauma, particularly open fractures and those associated with severe soft tissue injury, are at increased risk for nonunion. Patients whose baseline risk for nonunion is elevated due to chronic disease, such as those with diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, malnutrition, or neuropathy, must be reevaluated frequently (usually weekly or every other week) during the course of fracture healing. Immunosuppression, malignancy, and local infection may also impair fracture healing. (See <a href=\"#H66786344\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis'</a> above.) </p><p>Some medications may inhibit bone healing and should be used cautiously after a fracture occurs. However, many studies of the effect of medications upon bone healing use animal models and should be interpreted conservatively when considering the effect on humans. The following table lists some of the agents known to adversely affect bone healing after a fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53621 \">table 4</a>). Drugs that affect bone metabolism generally are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that affect bone metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Drugs that <strong>may</strong> impair fracture healing include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): The effect of these drugs on bone healing is discussed separately.

Effects may be dose dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The mechanism is thought to involve effects on cartilage growth and production.

Fractures, with or without a nerve injury, are a common inciting event. Early recognition and initiation of therapy is important for successful treatment. CRPS is discussed in detail separately.

Pelvis and femur fractures can cause severe hemorrhage; hip and multiple rib fractures predispose to other life-threatening complications, primarily deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary contusion respectively. (See <a href=\"#H66786302\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute complications occur as a direct result of the trauma sustained and can include damage to vascular structures, nerves, or soft tissue. Long bone fractures (eg, tibia) are most often associated with acute compartment syndrome, a limb-threatening condition. (See <a href=\"#H66786309\" class=\"local\">'Arterial injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H66786316\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H66786323\" class=\"local\">'Compartment syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major orthopedic trauma substantially increases the risk for venous thrombosis, and prophylactic treatment is indicated in most cases. (See <a href=\"#H66786330\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed complications may occur after initial treatment or in response to treatment. Examples include osteomyelitis, nonunion, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Open fractures are at greater risk for osteomyelitis. The particular fracture types and medications associated with fracture nonunion are described in the text. Frequent reevaluation of high risk fractures is imperative to help prevent nonunion or malunion.
