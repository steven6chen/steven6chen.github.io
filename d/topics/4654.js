Infection manifests most often as potentially fatal meningoencephalitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary disease. The emergence of clusters of cryptococcosis due to <em>C. gattii</em> in British Columbia, Canada, in 1999, with subsequent spread to the United States Pacific Northwest, has challenged our understanding of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. <em>C. gattii</em> infection had previously been detected infrequently and was thought to be largely restricted to tropical and subtropical regions, including Australia and Papua New Guinea. It is now clear that sporadic cases occur in various regions around the world.</p><p>The antifungal treatment and other aspects of management of <em>C. gattii</em> infection will be reviewed here. The microbiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of <em>C. gattii</em> infection are discussed separately; <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em> infection is also reviewed elsewhere.

Only <em>C. neoformans </em>has been included in the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institutes (CLSI) guidelines for testing of yeasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Clinical breakpoints and epidemiologic cut-off values based on MIC distributions of wild-type strains of <em>C. gattii</em> are being studied using both CLSI methodology and the commercial Sensititre YeastOne system (TREK Diagnostics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. </p><p>Despite these limitations, MICs, most commonly determined by broth microdilution, have been reported for <em>C. gattii</em> and may provide help to clinicians in the management of <em>C. gattii</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Many studies have documented low antifungal MICs against <em>C. gattii</em> and <em>C. neoformans </em>that have not increased over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, in some regions, concern has arisen over whether <em>C. gattii</em> may be less susceptible than <em>C. neoformans</em> to some antifungal agents. A group in Brazil reported significantly higher geometric mean MICs for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, amphotericin B, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> against <em>C. gattii</em> compared with <em>C. neoformans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a study from Spain, fluconazole, voriconazole, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> MICs were significantly higher against <em>C. gattii</em> than against <em>C. neoformans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], whilst in Taiwan, <em>C. gattii</em> has been reported to be less susceptible to flucytosine and amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In vitro susceptibility to azoles appears to vary among <em>C. gattii</em> genotypes, with several studies showing that <em>C. gattii </em>genotype VGII has higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> MICs than other genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/6,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15-19</a>], including one study of 90 clinical and environmental isolates of <em>C. gattii</em> from the Pacific Northwest of North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although the clinical implications of higher fluconazole MICs have not been determined, there is major interest in this issue since <em>C. gattii</em> genotype VGII is the genotype associated with the ongoing outbreak of <em>C. gattii</em> infection in the Pacific Northwest of North America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90024 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and epidemiology of Cryptococcus neoformans infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Genotype VGII isolates with relatively low susceptibilities to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> have been found to have sustained susceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/6,7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,18</a>]. Clinical experience suggests that these azoles may have improved activity when used during the <span class=\"nowrap\">consolidation/maintenance</span> phase of therapy in which the goal is to administer oral azole therapy for months to eradicate the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16486327\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Since increased MICs have been observed with some <em>C. gattii</em> isolates, we suggest that susceptibility testing be performed in regions where genotype VGII isolates are prevalent, such as the United States Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, Canada. Because susceptibility testing is useful in monitoring resistance trends, it may also be performed in other regions.</p><p>Antifungal susceptibility testing is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antifungal-susceptibility-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antifungal susceptibility testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16486327\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of <em>C. gattii</em> infection is based largely upon expert opinion. There are no randomized trial data regarding therapy of <em>C. gattii</em> infection, and optimal management strategies are not yet defined. An observational study has provided some insights regarding the treatment of <em>C. gattii</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Because there are far more data for <em>C. neoformans</em> than <em>C. gattii</em>, the treatment recommendations for <em>C. gattii</em> infection have been extrapolated largely from data involving <em>C. neoformans</em> infection. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) treatment guidelines outline similar treatment principles for <em>C. gattii</em> infection and <em>C. neoformans</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Our recommendations are generally in keeping with those of the IDSA in that an induction course of antifungal treatment is followed by <span class=\"nowrap\">consolidation/suppressive</span> therapy to prevent relapse of infection. In two series of <em>C. gattii</em> infections, treatment regimens were concordant with the IDSA guidelines in over 77 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Yet for <em>C. gattii</em> infection, clinical experience indicates that the choice of regimen and the duration of therapy are guided more by the site(s) of infection, including the presence or absence of cryptococcomas, than by the immune status of the host. There are no data to indicate that treatment of immunocompromised patients should differ from that of immunocompetent patients. In this regard, our recommendations for the treatment of <em>C. gattii</em> infection differ from the IDSA guidelines, in which the treatment of <em>C. neoformans</em> infection varies depending upon the immune status of the host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8632155\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16486339\"><span class=\"h3\">Meningoencephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following discussion involves the therapy for <em>C. gattii</em> meningoencephalitis, which may or may not be accompanied by the presence of cerebral cryptococcomas. Cryptococcomas may warrant additional therapy, and their treatment is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H16486381\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral cryptococcomas'</a> below.)</p><p>Because one of the critical determinants of outcome of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is control of intracranial pressure (ICP), ICP should always be measured as part of the lumbar puncture procedure. When elevated, ICP should be reduced by repeated lumbar puncture or, in some cases, by a lumbar drain, ventriculostomy, or a ventriculoperitoneal shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/8,21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21,25,26</a>]. Symptomatic hydrocephalus visible on imaging requires antifungal therapy plus early relief of ICP by shunting.

These recommendations are based upon collective clinical experience (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptococcus-gattii-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H12417189\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptococcus gattii infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> (0.7 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously [IV] once daily) is often used, but, if there is nephrotoxicity, lipid-based amphotericin B formulations such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> (3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-lipid-complex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B lipid complex</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV daily) appear to be equally effective and can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The shorter induction course of four weeks should be reserved for patients without neurologic complications who have had a clear clinical response and who have had clearance of <em>C. gattii</em> from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures after two weeks of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients#H1351839573\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptococcus neoformans: Treatment of meningoencephalitis and disseminated infection in HIV seronegative patients&quot;, section on 'Duration of preferred regimen'</a>.)</p><p>We repeat a lumbar puncture after two weeks of induction therapy, when feasible, to assess the response to therapy; lumbar puncture may have to be repeated sooner for management of increased intracranial pressure or for concern about possible microbiologic failure. Patients whose CSF cultures remain positive should continue the induction regimen with serial lumbar punctures every two weeks until the CSF becomes sterile.

Of 73 patients with CNS disease, 64 patients (88 percent) received induction therapy with amphotericin B, 78 percent with concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a>, for a median of six weeks (range 2 to 16 weeks). The median total duration of antifungal therapy (including azole therapy, most commonly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>) was 18 months (range 8 to 60 months). Among the patients who received amphotericin B, 80 percent had a complete or partial clinical response at 12 months. In contrast, among nine patients who received fluconazole induction therapy, seven (78 percent) required reinduction therapy with amphotericin B plus flucytosine for clinical failure. Of the 64 patients who received amphotericin B as part of the induction regimen, all received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> initially, but 31 (48 percent) were switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> after a median of eight days due to renal impairment. In the outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, the median duration of therapy for patients with CNS disease was 12.3 months; approximately 55 percent of patients were deemed to have achieved a complete or partial response at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Observational data indicate that <em>C. gattii</em> infection can be eradicated with appropriate antifungal therapy of adequate duration. In the study described above and in a previous report, there were no late relapses (at five to seven years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16486375\"><span class=\"h4\">Consolidation and maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The consolidation regimen of choice to prevent relapse is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> rather than another azole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Fluconazole should be given at a dose of 400 mg orally daily for eight weeks followed by maintenance dosing of 200 mg orally daily for approximately 12 months to eradicate infection. The total duration of antifungal therapy, however, depends upon the clinical and mycologic response, with many clinicians extending the duration of maintenance therapy beyond 12 months for cure. As noted above, among 73 patients with <em>C. gattii</em> CNS disease, the median total duration of antifungal therapy was 18 months (range 8 to 60 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-gattii-infection-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Clinicians treating patients from areas of VGII endemicity, particularly VGIIb and VGIIc endemicity (eg, the Pacific Northwest region of the United States for both genotypes and British Columbia, Canada, for VGIIb) should be guided in their choice of an azole by susceptibility testing results.
