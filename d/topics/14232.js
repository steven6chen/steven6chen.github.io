The occurrence of ADEs is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], prolonged hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and higher costs of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].</p><p>A 2007 report from the Institute of Medicine estimated that between 380,000 and 450,000 preventable ADEs occurred annually in United States (US) hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Assuming 400,000 preventable ADEs each year at an incremental hospital cost of $5857 each [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], the estimated cost of ADEs in 2006 was 3.5 billion US dollars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The Joint Commission has established national patient safety goals requiring each health care organization to implement comprehensive medication reconciliation at every transition point (eg, admission, transfer, discharge) along the continuum of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus on interventions to prevent ADEs caused by medication errors in the hospital setting.

ADEs, compared with medication errors, are a more direct measure of patient harm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication errors refer to any mistakes occurring in the medication use process, regardless of whether an injury occurred or whether the potential for injury was present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Approximately 1 in 100 medication errors result in an ADE, while 7 in 100 have the potential to do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although relatively few medication errors result in ADEs, they provide important information for identifying opportunities to improve patient care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventable ADEs are ADEs resulting from a medication error that can be avoided. At least a quarter of all medication-related injuries are preventable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Preventable ADEs include errors made by the clinician and systematic errors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), or non-preventable ADEs, are ADEs that occur due to pharmacologic properties of the drug.

Potential ADEs are also called near-miss errors or close calls. Potential ADEs include errors that are detected and intercepted by a patient or clinical staff before the patient is affected.</p><p/><p>The relationship between ADEs, medication errors, preventable ADEs, non-preventable ADEs (ADRs), and potential ADEs is depicted in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68954\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68954 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31685108\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many studies have examined the incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs), but estimates vary widely depending on definitions of events, units of analysis, detection methods (eg, voluntary reporting, chart review, computerized surveillance), clinical settings, and subjects studied. Most early data examining ADEs came from observational studies performed in the United States (US) and Canada, usually in urban tertiary care hospitals. Subsequent studies in international settings have largely corroborated these results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>ADEs can be broadly classified as occurring prior to hospitalization (in the outpatient setting or in the emergency department), during hospitalization, and immediately following discharge (to home or to another facility).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to hospitalization &ndash; ADEs in the outpatient setting are an important cause of emergency department visits and hospital admissions. One study in a Canadian hospital found that 2.4 percent of emergency department visits were associated with an ADE, of which 29 percent were preventable and 42 percent required hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One study in a US hospital found that ADEs were responsible for 1.4 percent of hospital admissions, of which 28 percent were preventable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During hospitalization &ndash; Several studies have documented the incidence of ADEs during hospitalization. The ADE Prevention Study was one of the first rigorous prospective cohort studies of ADEs in the hospital setting, with 6.5 ADEs per 100 adult admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. More than one-fourth of ADEs were preventable. Other large observational studies reported rates of ADEs from 2.4 to 52 ADEs per 100 hospital admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/2,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15-18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital discharge &ndash; Many ADEs occur following discharge from the hospital. The incidence of ADEs for patients discharged home was 11 percent in a study of one US academic hospital, of which 27 percent were preventable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients were less likely to experience an ADE if they remembered someone explaining the side effects of prescribed medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospital-discharge-and-readmission#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospital discharge and readmission&quot;, section on 'Medication reconciliation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2261779\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADEs can occur in any area of the hospital, including the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>], different hospital wards, and the operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>]. Two of the most common settings where ADEs occur are in the intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/8,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30-32</a>] and during off hours (nights and weekends).</p><p>ADEs are more common in ICUs than in general medical and surgical units for several reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. First, patients in ICUs receive more medications than those in general medical and surgical units. Second, most medications in the ICU are given intravenously, leading to a higher risk of errors due to miscalculation of doses and infusion rates. Third, most patients in the ICU have multiple severe comorbidities and often are sedated, making them unable to check their own drugs or report on medication-related symptoms. Lastly, patients in the ICU are at increased risk of unintentional discontinuation of medications for chronic diseases (eg, antiplatelets, anticoagulants, statins), leading to ADEs over the long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>ADEs may be more likely to occur overnight and during weekends, partly due to less staffing and supervision. In one pediatric hospital, medication error rates were higher during evening and night shifts compared with day shifts, and higher during weekends compared with weekdays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531415754\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Younger children, older adults, and individuals with multiple comorbidities are at particular risk for ADEs.</p><p>Children are at high risk for medication errors and ADEs mainly because of the need to tailor doses to age, weight, or body mass index. Younger children are also not usually able to identify potential errors themselves compared with older patients. In one study, 2.3 ADEs, 10 potential ADEs, and 55 medication errors occurred per 100 admissions at two US urban teaching hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Another study reported a higher ADE rate (11.1 ADEs per 100 patients) in 12 US hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Older adult patients are vulnerable to medication errors and ADEs due to their multiple comorbidities, diminished physiologic reserve, and more frequent use of multiple drugs. A meta-analysis of observational studies found that older adult patients were four times more likely to be hospitalized for an adverse drug reaction (ADR) than younger adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Another study found that 15 percent of hospitalized patients 70 years of age and older experienced at least one ADE, of which more than half were judged to be preventable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The prevention of ADEs in the older adult population is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;, section on 'Preventing adverse drug events'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2261838\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several drug classes have been consistently associated with ADEs in studies of hospitalized patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51353 \">table 1</a>). Anticoagulants, anti-hyperglycemic agents, sedatives, narcotics, antibiotics, antipsychotics, and chemotherapeutic agents are among the leading drug classes associated with ADEs in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/8,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,41,42</a>]. These drugs have several common features including narrow therapeutic windows, the potential for idiosyncratic physiologic responses, and variable dosing regimens. Several of the medications require close monitoring and dose adjustment, with the potential for calculation and timing errors. The most common medication classes causing ADEs in children include narcotics, antibiotics, and <span class=\"nowrap\">electrolytes/fluids</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/37,38,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31685187\"><span class=\"h1\">DETECTION METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The commonly used methods for detecting adverse drug events (ADEs) include voluntary reporting, chart review, computerized surveillance, and direct observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Each method detects different types of ADEs, and no single detection method is considered a gold standard for tracking ADEs. Multiple methods may be required to approximate the true ADE rate.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voluntary reporting by clinicians detects a small fraction of ADEs. Whether a given event is reported depends on individual attitudes, safety culture of the organization or hospital unit, ease of completing the report, fear of punishment, and concern about liability exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Voluntary reporting identifies the lowest number of errors compared with chart review and automated surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical record or chart review is a more systematic method for identifying ADEs, detecting many more ADEs compared with voluntary reporting (65 versus 4 percent) and computerized surveillance (65 versus 45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, chart review is costly and time-consuming, and certain ADEs are not reliably recorded in the medical record due to variable standards for documentation, liability concerns, lack of clinician awareness of the ADE, and incomplete record retrieval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of an ADE trigger tool such as that developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement can facilitate manual and automated chart reviews and increase detection of ADEs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computerized surveillance detects many events not captured by voluntary reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Automated surveillance can be used to monitor a large patient population continuously, with fewer labor hours than chart review. However, few hospitals have access to these types of automated surveillance systems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct observation by trained staff is regarded as the most effective method to detect medication administration errors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, it is also among the most expensive approaches. A study comparing voluntary reporting, chart review, and direct observation found that direct observation identified the greatest number of errors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reports by patients and family members show promise as a detection method that complements other approaches. This method is well demonstrated in research studies, but its performance in operational settings requires further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671616258\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several interventions have been used to prevent adverse drug events (ADEs) and can generally be categorized as provider- or system-based interventions. Provider- and system-based interventions should be used together to optimally prevent ADEs.</p><p>A series of steps is required to manage medications: drug prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, administering, and monitoring. Although medication errors can occur at any step, most interventions are directed at the steps where ADEs tend to occur, which include drug prescribing, administration, and monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/37,38,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671616288\"><span class=\"h2\">Provider-based approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The individual clinician should ideally review the medication list at each patient encounter. Issues to consider (eg, dose, directions, drug interactions, and side effects) when reviewing medications are summarized in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64079 \">table 2</a>) and an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61655\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61655 \">algorithm 1</a>). Provider-based interventions to prevent ADEs are similar for the inpatient and outpatient settings. Some have noted value in including the medication&rsquo;s indication (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pain) on the prescription or medication order [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671616273\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoid and be vigilant of high-risk drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several drug classes have been consistently associated with ADEs in studies of hospitalized patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51353 \">table 1</a>). Clinicians prescribing high-risk drugs should be vigilant for adverse effects and should consider discontinuing these drugs or replacing with drugs that are less likely to cause adverse effects (eg, changing narcotics to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] in children, older adults, and patients with a history of substance abuse who may be more susceptible to adverse outcomes) (see <a href=\"#H2261838\" class=\"local\">'High-risk drugs'</a> above). Organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offer safe prescribing guidelines for opioids for chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83969940\"><span class=\"h3\">Discontinue unnecessary drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of ADEs increases with number of medications taken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/30,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,59,60</a>]. In addition to potentially harmful drugs, patients are often taking drugs that were previously given for a prior indication and are no longer needed (eg, proton pump inhibitors for gastrointestinal stress prophylaxis). It is likely that reducing the number of medications a patient is taking will lead to fewer ADEs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. One approach to assessing whether a drug is truly necessary for a given patient is presented in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61655\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61655 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671616393\"><span class=\"h3\">Consider drugs as a cause of any new symptom</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many preventable ADEs are simply due to clinicians failing to discontinue or adjust medications appropriately in the presence of significant side effects. In one prospective cohort of 661 patients, there were 51 cases of medication-related symptoms, in which 32 (63 percent) were attributed to clinicians failing to respond to patient symptoms while 19 (37 percent) were attributed to patients failing to report significant symptoms to the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Drug-induced side effects should be considered when a patient presents with a new complaint. Clinicians should discontinue or reduce the dose of medications thought to cause significant adverse effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An approach to the patient with drug allergy&quot;, section on 'Identification of the suspect drug'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671616563\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoid treating side effects with another drug</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians are often tempted to start medications to treat new symptoms (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a> for opioid-induced pruritis), even when symptoms are clearly related to the initiation of new medication.

Adjusting appropriately for age is particularly important in pediatric and geriatric populations. Renal impairment can occur at any age but becomes more common with advancing age. For patients with stable renal function, creatinine clearance can be estimated according to published formulas which factor age into the calculation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-creatinine-clearance-measured\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Due to decreased muscle mass in older adults, however, serum creatinine levels may not adequately reflect renal function. As a general rule, the initial dose for starting medications in older adults should be significantly reduced, and titrated up as tolerated by monitoring side effects or drug levels.</p><p>The drug database (Lexi-Comp) available through UpToDate includes appropriate dose adjustments for age and renal function. Dose adjustments can be accessed by searching on any individual drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671616807\"><span class=\"h3\">Address non-adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As patients may have concerns about taking certain medications or may not be taking medications as directed, the review of a patient&rsquo;s medication list can allay patient fears and improve patient adherence to medications. Patients should be educated on the indications for each medication, possible side effects, and alternative options that may decrease the risk of ADEs. Factors affecting medication adherence (eg, communication barriers, inadequate follow-up) and specific methods to improve adherence (eg, motivational interviewing) are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence to lipid-altering medications and recommended lifestyle changes&quot;, section on 'Strategies for increasing adherence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31685222\"><span class=\"h2\">System-based approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most medication errors and ADEs are caused by poorly designed systems that either induce errors or make them difficult to detect.

While human error is usually the proximal event leading to an ADE, another fundamental fault is in the system that permits the error to reach the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. As an example, when a clinician prescribes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> for a patient with renal impairment but fails to adjust the dose for estimated creatinine clearance, the clinician&rsquo;s error could result in an ADE.

Some CPOE systems provide more than prescription-writing capabilities with fixed fields and drop-down menus for drug, dose, route, and frequency. These systems are further enhanced by the integration of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) of varying sophistication. CDSS includes interactive software designed to assist health professionals in making clinical choices. CPOE with CDSS targets the prescribing stage of the medication use process and improves medication safety in the following ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing a means for standardization of practice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improving the completeness and legibility of orders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alerting clinicians to drug allergies, drug-drug interactions, and cumulative dose-limits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Updating clinicians with the most current medication information</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing dosage adjustment calculations based on patient characteristics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timely communication of critical changes in a patient&rsquo;s condition, in turn facilitating appropriate adjustments</p><p/><p>Several studies have found that CPOE with CDSS significantly prevents medication errors and ADEs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/69-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-73</a>]. In one study, the implementation of CPOE with CDSS reduced the serious medication error rate by 55 percent and potential ADE rate by 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Another study reported that CPOE with CDSS improved the rate of appropriate prescribing of nephrotoxic drugs compared with CPOE only (51 versus 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Some studies have reported unintended consequences related to the introduction of CPOE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-78</a>], especially among CPOE systems with limited decision support. Examples include inflexible ordering formats generating incorrect orders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>] and juxtaposition errors in which clinicians click on the adjacent patient name or medication from a list and inadvertently enter the wrong order [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

Medication orders that are manually transcribed to a paper medication administration record and used by nurses to administer medications are prone to causing errors and ADEs. When CPOE has an electronic interface with an electronic medication administration record (eMAR), the need for medication transcription is eliminated, removing errors caused by interpretation and translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/67,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,79,80</a>].

While one study in a pediatric hospital found that the combination of smart pumps, standard drug concentrations, and improved labeling led to a 73 percent reduction in reported medication-infusion errors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], most other studies reported no significant impact of smart pumps on serious medication errors and ADEs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-87</a>].</p><p>Several barriers undermine the effective implementation of smart pumps, such as inconsistencies in the smart pump drug libraries and bypassing of safety alerts during administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/85,88-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,88-90</a>]. A study of 100 hospitals using smart pumps from the same manufacturer suggested substantial variability in drug names, dosing units, dose limits, and concentrations within the same library, which raise the risk of errors and ADEs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].
