It can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy, depending upon the stage of the disease. The primary goal of surgery is the complete removal of the rectal cancer. Secondary goals include preservation of anorectal sphincter function and bowel continuity when possible.</p><p>The surgical anatomy of the rectum, principles of rectal surgery for cancer, the choice of operative approaches, and the use of intraoperative adjuncts (eg, imaging and radiotherapy) are discussed here. Specific surgical techniques and their indications are reviewed separately.

It is 12 to 15 cm in length, and lacks taeniae, epiploic appendices, haustra, or a well-defined mesentery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72874 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In women, the anterior rectum is in close proximity to the posterior vagina and uterine cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62230 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78927\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78927 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59561\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59561 \">figure 4</a>). In men, it is behind the bladder, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80126 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>Although the precise description of the upper and lower limits of the rectum varies between anatomists and surgeons, it is generally accepted that the upper (proximal) limit of the rectum is at the rectosigmoid junction. The lower (distal) limit of the rectum is at the dentate line, which is located in the middle of the anorectal ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 6</a>). The dentate line is also the point at which columnar mucosa of the rectum transitions to squamous mucosa of the anus. </p><p>The upper limit of the rectum is defined operatively as where the taeniae coli of the sigmoid colon splay and become indistinct. Radiographically, the sacral promontory is generally regarded as the upper limit of the rectum. Endoscopically, the upper limit of the rectum is defined as 15 cm from the anal verge on rigid proctoscopic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The location of a rectal cancer is identified by its distance from the anal verge rather than the dentate line. Low (distal) rectal cancers are located 4 to 8 cm from the anal verge, middle rectal cancers 8 to 12 cm, and upper (proximal) rectal cancers 12 to 15 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The anal canal is 0 to 4 cm from the anal verge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107991\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107991 \">figure 7</a>). However, surgical decision making for sphincter preservation is dependent mostly upon the distance from the lower border of the tumor to the top of the anorectal ring rather than the anal verge.</p><p>The rectum has three lateral curves corresponding to the valves (folds) of Houston (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72874 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The upper and lower curves are convex to the right, and the middle is convex to the left. Once the rectum is mobilized, these valves are no longer present and are responsible for the increase in length gained during the surgical dissection.</p><p>The rectum is typically located below the peritoneal reflexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The posterior rectal wall, which is close to the sacral hollow, is entirely extraperitoneal. The upper rectum is invested by peritoneum anteriorly and laterally, and the middle rectum is invested by peritoneum only anteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81248 \">figure 8</a>). </p><p>The fascia propria is an extension of the pelvic fascia and encloses the rectum, adipose tissue, blood, and lymphatic vessels. It is more pronounced laterally and posteriorly and forms the lateral ligaments of the rectum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62931 \">figure 9</a>). In 25 percent of patients, the lateral ligaments contain branches of the middle rectal artery and venous plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The rectum is not suspended by a true mesentery (ie, two layers of peritoneum that suspend an organ). The &quot;mesorectum&quot; is perirectal areolar tissue that is thicker posteriorly and contains the terminal branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51221\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51221 \">figure 10</a>). </p><p>The rectum occupies the sacral concavity and ends 2 to 3 cm proximal to the tip of the coccyx. The presacral fascia covers the concavity of the sacrum and coccyx, presacral nerves, the middle sacral artery, and presacral veins. This plane should not be violated during the pelvic dissection, as life-threatening hemorrhage from the presacral venous plexus can occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70625\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70625 \">figure 11</a>).

The upper rectum is supplied by the superior rectal artery (SRA), a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756 \">figure 12</a>). The middle and lower rectum are supplied by the middle rectal artery and inferior rectal artery, respectively, which branch from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the pudendal artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756 \">figure 12</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87588332\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous and lymphatic drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathways for the lymphatic and venous drainage of the rectum are cephalad and lateral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81960 \">figure 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58219 \">figure 14</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79743\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79743 \">figure 15</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The lymphatic drainage of the upper two-thirds of the rectum is along the pathway of the superior hemorrhoidal vein, cephalad to the inferior mesenteric nodes, and the paraaortic nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The lymphatic drainage of the lower third of the rectum is cephalad as well as lateral along the middle hemorrhoidal vessels to the internal iliac nodes. There are no communications between the inferior mesenteric and internal iliac lymphatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In women, lymphatic drainage above the dentate line also includes the posterior wall of the vagina and reproductive organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Below the dentate line, the drainage is along the inferior rectal lymphatics to the superior inguinal nodes and along the pathway of the inferior rectal artery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87588339\"><span class=\"h2\">Innervation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All pelvic nerves lie in the plane between the peritoneum and the endopelvic fascia, and can be injured or transected during a rectal dissection. </p><p>The preganglionic fibers via the sympathetic nerves follow the branches of the IMA and the SRA to the left colon and upper rectum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63993\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63993 \">figure 16</a>). The presacral nerves, which are a fusion of the aortic plexus and lumbar splanchnic plexus, innervate the lower rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Just below the sacral promontory, the presacral nerves form the hypogastric plexus. The main hypogastric nerves enter the rectum laterally and carry sympathetic innervation from the hypogastric to the pelvic plexus, located on the lateral side of the pelvis adjacent to the lateral stalks, at the level of the lower rectum.</p><p>The parasympathetic plexus emerges through the sacral foramen and joins the sympathetic hypogastric nerves at the pelvic plexus. Postganglion parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers are distributed to the left colon and upper rectum via the inferior mesenteric plexus and directly to the lower rectum and upper anal canal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87588778\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients with a newly diagnosed rectal cancer, a pretreatment staging evaluation is required, which includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History and physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine laboratory tests, including liver function tests and a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rigid proctosigmoidoscopy and digital rectal examination to determine the distance of the cancer from the anal verge, mobility, and position in relation to the anal sphincter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endorectal ultrasound or dedicated high-resolution rectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the local extent of the tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonoscopy to assess for synchronous colonic lesions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to assess for metastatic disease.</p><p/><p>Upon completion of the pretreatment staging evaluation, patients are assigned a clinical stage according to the tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72913 \">table 1</a>).

A local excision is usually performed transanally. A radical excision is performed transabdominally with either a sphincter-sparing procedure or an abdominal perineal resection. Rectal cancers that have invaded adjacent organs may require a multivisceral resection.

For transabdominal procedures, such as sphincter-sparing procedures or abdominal perineal resection (APR), it is also crucial to perform a total mesorectal excision (TME) and an adequate lymph node dissection. Whenever feasible, the patient's intestinal continuity should be reestablished by preserving <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> anorectal function (ie, fecal continence).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87590731\"><span class=\"h2\">Resection margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of surgery for rectal cancer is to achieve histologically negative proximal, distal, and radial margins as discussed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3401695258\"><span class=\"h3\">Proximal margin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A minimum negative proximal margin of 5 cm is required to remove draining lymphatics and assure an anastomosis to well-vascularized bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Unlike the distal margin, a 5-cm proximal margin is technically easy to achieve, especially if the splenic flexure has been mobilized. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87590738\"><span class=\"h3\">Distal margin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Margins of resection must be histologically negative on the final pathology report. A positive distal margin was associated with a local recurrence rate approaching 40 percent (hazard ratio [HR] 16.8, 95% CI 4.8-5.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and a decreased five-year survival (HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.08-5.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], even with the use of TME and adjuvant radiotherapy. </p><p>However, the desire for a long negative distal margin is in direct conflict with the desire for sphincter preservation, especially in patients with mid-to-low rectal cancers. A compromise between ensuring oncologic safety and maximizing sphincter preservation must be struck when selecting an appropriate distal margin. (See <a href=\"#H721484551\" class=\"local\">'Minimum distal margin requirement'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H721484551\"><span class=\"h4\">Minimum distal margin requirement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For cancers located above the distal mesorectal margin, the minimum recommended negative distal margin is 2 cm for most sphincter-sparing procedures performed in conjunction with a TME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For cancers located at or below the distal mesorectal margin, a 1-cm negative distal margin may be acceptable, particularly in the setting of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (see <a href=\"#H193359582\" class=\"local\">'Effect of TME and radiation therapy on minimum distal margin requirement'</a> below). Failure to achieve this 1- to 2-cm gross negative distal margin is an indication to convert from a sphincter-sparing procedure to an APR, which extends the distal margin to the anus. </p><p>Historically, a 5-cm negative distal margin for rectal cancers was routinely recommended, or else an APR was performed. For distal rectal cancers, a 2-cm negative distal margin became acceptable based upon findings from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) R-01 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. Although the R-01 trial was designed to study the effect of adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer, data were also analyzed to compare the outcomes of various surgical techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. For the 108 patients who underwent sphincter-sparing procedures without any adjuvant therapy in that study, those with smaller distal resection margins (&lt;2 cm or 2 to 2.9 cm) had similar rates of treatment failure or mortality at 48 months compared with patients who had larger distal resection margins (&ge;3 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>For more proximal, upper rectal cancers, tumor-specific mesorectal excision with perpendicular transection of the mesorectum leaving a 5-cm distal margin distal to the tumor is acceptable. (See <a href=\"#H87593594\" class=\"local\">'TME technique'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193359582\"><span class=\"h4\">Effect of TME and radiation therapy on minimum distal margin requirement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the NSABP R-01 trial, significant advances have been made in both surgical techniques (eg, the wide adoption of TME) and adjuvant therapy. In a meta-analysis of patients who underwent sphincter-sparing rectal cancer surgery with TME <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy, patients whose distal margins were negative but less than 1 cm did not have higher local recurrence rates than those with greater distal margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. By contrast, patients who did not receive either TME or radiation therapy had higher local recurrence rates if their distal margins were negative by less than 1 cm (odds ratio 2.5). </p><p>Until prospective data become available from trials utilizing modern surgical techniques and adjuvant therapy, however, a negative distal resection margin of 1 to 2 cm is still recommended for radical rectal cancer surgeries, as outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H721484551\" class=\"local\">'Minimum distal margin requirement'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87590752\"><span class=\"h3\">Radial margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rectal cancer surgery, the circumferential radial margins (CRM) are equally as important as the distal margin. A histologic CRM of greater than 1 mm is required. However, in one large cohort study, as many as 17 percent of patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery had a positive CRM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A positive CRM is an independent predictor of local recurrences and inferior survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>].</p><p>The risk of having a positive CRM is increased in patients with locally advanced tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Thus, patients whose presurgical staging evaluation demonstrates tumor within 2 mm of the mesorectal fascia should receive neoadjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of having a positive CRM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Mesorectal fascia involvement'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Performing the dissection in a proper plane also plays a key role in preventing positive CRMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, more positive CRMs were identified in APRs performed through the sphincter muscle plane, rather than through the levator muscle plane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. During APR, the levator ani muscle should be resected en bloc with the rectum and anal canal to avoid CRM involvement or perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-cancer-surgical-techniques#H2189789634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal cancer: Surgical techniques&quot;, section on 'Techniques of abdominal perineal resection'</a>.)</p><p>Dissecting in the proper plane also ensures adequate performance of a TME as discussed below.

Although the five-year relapse-free survival rates were similar in the TME alone and TME plus lateral dissection groups (73.3 versus 73.4 percent), the local recurrence rate was higher in the TME alone group (12.6 versus 7.4 percent), mostly accounted for by lateral compartment failures (57 percent). </p><p>In Western countries, however, lateral pelvic lymph node dissection is performed less frequently.

In particular, routine lateral or extended lymphadenectomy may not be of as much value in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy, which is standard presurgical treatment for lower rectal cancer in Western countries. Additionally, according to a meta-analysis of 20 studies including over 5500 patients, lateral or extended lymphadenectomy was associated with higher rates of male sexual and urinary dysfunction than standard TME (odds ratio [OR] 3.70, 95% CI 1.66-8.23).

Laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery has been compared with open surgery in four randomized trials with conflicting results. Until further data become available, the best surgical approach needs to be determined individually by tumor and patient characteristics, as well as surgeon experience. When performing laparoscopic rectal surgery for cancer, surgeons should have a low threshold for converting to open surgery when difficulties arise with dissection. The details of the four trials are summarized below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A European multicenter trial (COlorectal cancer Laparoscopic or Open Resection [COLOR II]) randomly assigned 1044 patients with a solitary adenocarcinoma of the rectum within 15 cm of the anal verge (no invasion, no mets) to undergo laparoscopic or open surgery in a 2:1 ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Patients with T4 lesions or T3 lesions that were within 2 mm of the mesorectal fascia were excluded. Results showed that the rates of macroscopic completeness of resection (88 versus 92 percent) and positive (&lt;2 mm) circumferential resection margin (10 versus 10 percent) were similar comparing laparoscopic and open groups. In addition, the median distal margin (3 cm versus 3 cm), and the 28-day morbidity (40 versus 37 percent) and mortality (1 versus 2 percent) were also similar. At three years, locoregional recurrence and survival were also similar between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A South Korean trial (COREAN) randomly assigned 340 patients with mid-to-low rectal cancer to undergo laparoscopic or open surgery after preoperative chemoradiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to involvement of the circumferential resection margin, macroscopic quality of the total mesorectal excision specimen, number of harvested lymph nodes, and perioperative morbidity. At three years, the disease-free survival was similar for the open and laparoscopic surgery groups (72.5 versus 79.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ACOSOG Z6051 trial, which was designed to show noninferiority of the laparoscopic approach, 486 patients with stage II or III rectal cancer within 12 cm of the anal verge were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic or open surgery after neoadjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The primary endpoint was successful pathologic outcome, defined as simultaneously achieving a &gt;1 mm distal margin, a &gt;1 mm circumferential radial margin, and an adequate total mesorectal excision. A successful outcome occurred in 81.7 percent of laparoscopic resections and 86.9 percent of open resections. Laparoscopic surgery failed to achieve the noninferiority criteria. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Australian Laparoscopic Cancer of the Rectum Trial (AlaCaRT), another noninferiority trial, 475 patients with T1 to T3 rectal cancer &lt;15 cm from the anal verge were randomly assigned to laparoscopic or open resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Like the ACOSOG Z6051 trial, the primary endpoint was simultaneous achievement of a &gt;1 mm distal margin, a &gt;1 mm circumferential radial margin, and an adequate total mesorectal excision. A successful resection was achieved in 82 percent of patients in the laparoscopic group versus 89 percent of patients in the open surgery group. Laparoscopic surgery failed to achieve the noninferiority criteria. </p><p/><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials, including the four described above, concluded that laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer resulted in a higher rate of &quot;noncomplete&quot; (composite of incomplete and near-complete) total mesorectal excision than open surgery (13.2 versus 10.4 percent), but the two techniques yielded similar rates of circumferential and distal margin involvement, mean numbers of lymph nodes retrieved, and mean distances to radial and distal margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Long-term follow-up data from the randomized trials will determine whether this higher rate of noncomplete total mesorectal excision translates into worse survival, which will in turn decide whether open or laparoscopic surgery should be preferred. </p><p>Until then, minimally invasive rectal cancer surgery should only be performed by surgeons experienced in performing minimally invasive proctectomy with total mesorectal excision. Patients with a threatened or high-risk circumferential margin based on preoperative staging, or with acute bowel obstruction or perforation from rectal cancer should undergo open, rather than laparoscopic surgery. These recommendations are consistent with NCCN guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>A retrospective review of the National Cancer Database identified 6313 patients who underwent surgery for nonmetastatic locally advanced rectal cancer from 2010 to 2014.

Compared with open proctectomy, laparoscopic proctectomy was associated with a lower positive circumferential margin rate (4.87 versus 7.62 percent) and a higher five-year overall survival rate (81 versus 76 percent). These results contradict the findings of the randomized trials, which could be due to either patient selection bias inherent to retrospective studies or the difference in practices between academic (randomized trials) and community surgeons (this study). In addition, this study lacks information on key variables such as patient body mass index, surgeon experience, completeness of total mesorectal excision, tumor distance from anal verge, and patient survival rates. </p><p>Laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery has been associated with short-term benefits of less postoperative ileus and pain, a shorter length of stay, fewer postoperative complications, and less blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-principles/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. However, most studies were conducted before the practice of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) became widely accepted. It remains to be seen if laparoscopic surgery will still convey the same advantages over open surgery after ERAS protocols have been implemented (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-recovery-after-colorectal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery&quot;</a>).

The robotic approach was associated with a longer operative time (by an average of 38 minutes) and a higher hospital cost (by an average of 980 pounds or 1132 dollars per patient).</p><p>The ROLARR trial demonstrated that robotic-assisted laparoscopic rectal surgery, when performed by surgeons with varying experience with robotic surgery, commands a longer operative time and a higher cost without offering any incremental benefit over conventional laparoscopic surgery.

(See <a href=\"#H87588019\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pretreatment staging evaluation is required for all patients with newly diagnosed primary rectal cancer to determine the tumor location in the rectum, its local extent, and to assess for the presence of any distant metastatic disease. Knowledge of the pretreatment stage is necessary for selecting the optimal surgical approach and for identifying patients who would benefit from chemo- or radiation therapy prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H87588778\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal cancer surgery includes local excision procedures and transabdominal procedures. Local excision procedures include transanal excision, transanal endoscopic microsurgery, and transanal minimally invasive surgery. Transabdominal procedures include sphincter-sparing procedures, abdominal perineal resection, and multivisceral resection. A stepwise approach to selecting the appropriate surgical technique is outlined in the accompanying algorithm and described in detail in other topics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108222\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108222 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H163064654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Management according to initial clinical stage'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All transabdominal surgical resection of the rectum must achieve all of the following (see <a href=\"#H87589530\" class=\"local\">'Principles of surgical resection'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Negative distal margin</strong> &ndash; Intraoperatively, the minimum acceptable negative distal margin is 2 cm for cancers located above the distal mesorectal margin. For cancers located at or below the distal mesorectal margin, a 1-cm negative distal margin is acceptable. Margins of resection must be histologically negative on the final pathology report. Failure to achieve an adequate distal margin mandates conversion of a sphincter-sparing procedure to an abdominal perineal resection to ensure optimal oncologic outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H87590738\" class=\"local\">'Distal margin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Negative proximal margin</strong> &ndash; A minimum negative proximal margin of 5 cm is required. (See <a href=\"#H3401695258\" class=\"local\">'Proximal margin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Negative circumferential radial margins</strong> &ndash; A circumferential radial margin of greater than 1 mm is required. (See <a href=\"#H87590752\" class=\"local\">'Radial margins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Total mesorectal excision</strong> &ndash; For patients undergoing either a sphincter-sparing procedure or an abdominal perineal resection of a rectal cancer, we recommend performing a total mesenteric excision (TME) rather than a blunt dissection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">A TME should be performed to a level of 5 cm below the distal margin of the primary tumor for tumors in the upper rectum, or to the pelvic floor (complete TME) for tumors in the lower or middle rectum. (See <a href=\"#H87590296\" class=\"local\">'Total mesorectal excision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Lymph node dissection</strong> &ndash; In most patients with rectal cancer, a lymph node dissection up to the level of the origin of the superior rectal artery should be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58219 \">figure 14</a>). &quot;High&quot; ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery at the origin of the aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756 \">figure 12</a>), or extended lymph node dissection laterally, is not necessary in the absence of clinically positive nodes. A benchmark of 12 lymph nodes has been adopted as a quality metric for colorectal cancer surgery by several societies, although the number of lymph nodes recovered may be lower after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H87591187\" class=\"local\">'Regional lymph node dissection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transabdominal rectal cancer surgery can be performed via open, laparoscopic, or robotic approaches. The best surgical approach needs to be determined individually by tumor and patient characteristics, as well as surgeon experience. When performing laparoscopic rectal surgery for cancer, surgeons should have a low threshold for converting to open surgery when difficulties arise with dissection. (See <a href=\"#H87591478\" class=\"local\">'Procedure approaches'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of hepatic metastases can be facilitated by using intra-operative ultrasound (IOUS) when available. However, we only use IOUS in patients with equivocal findings on preoperative imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H87595831\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative imaging'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Wexner SD, Jorge JMN.
