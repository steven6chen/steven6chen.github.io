These symptoms happen because the large intestine becomes inflamed and gets sores called &quot;ulcers.&quot; The large intestine is part of the digestive system. It is also called the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58531 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95343686\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can be mild or severe. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that often has blood in it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain, eye irritation, or skin rashes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95343703\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for ulcerative colitis in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can do the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests &ndash; Such as X-rays, CT scans or MRI scans. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called a &quot;colonoscopy&quot; &ndash; This test looks at the lining of the colon. During this test, a doctor puts a thin tube into the rectum (the lower part of the large intestine) and moves it up into the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>). The tube has a camera on it. It also has tools attached so the doctor can take samples of tissue to look at under a microscope. Sometimes doctors do a test called an &quot;upper endoscopy&quot; at the same time. During this test, the doctor looks at the upper part of the digestive system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95343781\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ulcerative colitis in children treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on each child's symptoms and other factors. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that go directly into the rectum &ndash; Doctors give these medicines to children with ulcerative colitis that affects only the rectum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines the child takes by mouth &ndash; A common type is called &quot;5-ASA.&quot; (If your child has trouble swallowing pills, the doctor can give your child liquid medicines or powders you put in foods or drinks.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines &ndash; If other medicines do not work, doctors can give steroid medicines to reduce swelling. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. Steroid medicines are usually taken for a few weeks or months at a time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stronger medicines for severe cases &ndash; These medicines work on the immune system to protect the colon from damage. Common ones are &quot;6-mercaptopurine&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">azathioprine</a>.&quot;</p><p/><p>Some children with severe symptoms need treatment in the hospital until the symptoms get better.</p><p>Ulcerative colitis and some of the medicines that treat it can affect your child's growth. During treatment, the doctor will check your child's height and weight often to make sure he or she is growing as normally as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95343798\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When medicines do not work, doctors can do surgery to remove the colon. After the colon is removed, ulcerative colitis does not come back.</p><p>When doctors do surgery for ulcerative colitis in children, they can remove the colon and rectum. After this, they can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Connect the rest of the intestine to the anus right away. Children who have this surgery can have bowel movements the normal way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wait until later to connect the intestine to the anus. This helps the intestine heal. Children who have this surgery can no longer have bowel movements in the normal way. Instead, their bowel movements come out through a hole in the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86623 \">figure 4</a>). A plastic bag catches the waste.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95343844\"><span class=\"h1\">Is my child at risk for colon cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child has ulcerative colitis, he or she can have an increased risk of colon cancer. The risk for colon cancer starts about 10 years after ulcerative colitis is found. After that, your child should have a colonoscopy every 1 or 2 years. Doctors can look for colon cancer and treat it if they find it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95343861\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bloody stools (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomach-ache-and-stomach-upset-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stomach ache and stomach upset (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Crohn disease in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bloody stools in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
