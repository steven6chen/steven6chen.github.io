But children who hit their head really hard can have serious problems. For example, some children with head injuries have a mild form of brain injury called a &quot;concussion.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195939385\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should call a doctor or nurse if your child has hit his or her head and the injury was more than a light bump.</p><p>You should see a doctor right away if your child hurt his or her head and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fell from a height taller than 3 to 5 feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is younger than 6 months old</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throws up more than once</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a seizure or passes out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a headache that is really bad or gets worse over time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble walking, talking, or seeing, seems confused, or is acting in ways that worry you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is still dizzy after a while</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has blood or watery fluid coming out of the nose or ears</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a cut that keeps bleeding after you put pressure on it for 10 minutes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is weak or numb in any body part</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is very cranky or can't stop crying</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble waking up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was hit really hard or with something moving very fast</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195939392\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to help my child after a head injury?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If the injury was not serious, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child lie down, do something quiet, or nap</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child drink clear liquids if he or she has thrown up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press on the injury with a clean cloth or gauze, if there is bleeding. Hold the pressure for 10 minutes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put ice or a cold pack on any lumps or swollen areas. Hold it there for 20 minutes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your child pain medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin)</p><p/><p>Watch your child closely after a head injury. If the injury gets worse or your child starts acting strangely, call the child's doctor right away. You can also go straight to the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195939399\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests my child should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests your child should have based on his or her age, symptoms, and individual situation. Most children with head injuries do not need an imaging test, such as an X-ray or MRI. Still, if the doctor or nurse suspects serious injury, he or she might order a special kind of X-ray called a CT scan (also called a &quot;CAT scan&quot;). CT scans create detailed pictures or the brain and skull. They can show internal bleeding or bone fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195939406\"><span class=\"h1\">How are head injuries treated in children and adolescents?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on how serious the injury is and what symptoms the child has. Often, the doctor will just want to wait and watch the child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195939413\"><span class=\"h1\">Can my child go back to normal activities after a head injury?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on how serious the injury is. If your child has a concussion, he or she should not play sports until a doctor says it's OK. If your child has had 2 head injuries in a row, check with your child's doctor before letting him or her go back to normal activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195939420\"><span class=\"h1\">Can head injuries in children and adolescents be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Here are some safety tips that can reduce your child's chances of getting a head injury. Make sure he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always wears a helmet when sitting in a bicycle seat or when being towed behind a bicycle in a trailer. The helmet should fit well (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59465 \">figure 1</a>). If the helmet has been in a crash, you should throw it away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is watched closely while biking until he or she is old enough to ride a bicycle alone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doesn't bike in the street unless he or she can control a bicycle. The child should also be able to follow traffic rules.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always sits in a car seat or booster seat until he or she is 4 feet, 9 inches tall. Make sure the seat is secured and set up the right way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot fall down stairs or out of windows higher than the first floor. Gates and guards can protect young children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knows how to cross streets by looking both ways for cars. Young children should never cross streets alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wears safety gear while skateboarding, skiing, or doing other sports. Gear includes helmets, mouth guards, and eyewear (glasses or goggles).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195939427\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mouth-and-dental-injuries-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mouth and dental injuries in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-head-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Closed head injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Concussion in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skull-and-facial-fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Skull and facial fractures (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Head injury in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
