The pathogenesis, incidence, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic NAR are presented in this topic review. Allergic rhinitis and an overview of other forms of rhinitis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NAR is best defined by the chronic presence of one or more of the four following cardinal symptoms of rhinitis, in the absence of a specific etiology (such as an immunologic, infectious, pharmacologic, structural, hormonal, vasculitic, metabolic, or atrophic cause):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sneezing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhinorrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal congestion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnasal drainage</p><p/><p>Although there is no consensus about how long symptoms should be present to establish chronicity, some studies have utilized a minimum duration of over one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The lack of clarity regarding the pathogenesis of this condition has led to an imprecise terminology and a number of synonyms used to refer to this entity. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic rhinitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonallergic, noninfectious rhinitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrinsic rhinitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasomotor rhinitis or nonallergic vasomotor rhinitis</p><p/><p>Some experts use the term &quot;nonallergic rhinitis&quot; to refer more generally to any form of rhinitis that is noninfectious and nonallergic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, in this topic review, NAR is used more narrowly, as defined above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single unifying theory of pathogenesis for chronic NAR, and it may represent a group of incompletely defined disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. However, NAR can be broadly divided into noninflammatory and inflammatory forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/7-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-34</a>], with the inflammatory form being further divided into cases that are either eosinophilic or noneosinophilic processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/1,2,7-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7-34</a>]. With all forms of chronic NAR, there is also a variable component of autonomic dysregulation. In the noninflammatory form, these neurologic abnormalities are the only demonstrable findings.</p><p>Patients with NAR often exhibit a clinical hypersensitivity to odors, which is usually manifested by the production of rhinitis symptoms. One group of researchers evaluated the neurogenic responses to <span class=\"nowrap\">chemical/olfactory</span> stimuli in patients with NAR using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Subjects underwent MRI during exposure to different types of odors. They exhibited increased blood flow to several odor-sensitive regions of the brain in response to both pleasant (vanilla) and unpleasant (hickory smoke) odors. The neurologic responses were associated with the production of symptoms upon exposure to hickory smoke. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninflammatory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the noninflammatory form (as defined by biopsies negative for inflammation), it has been postulated that the disease results from an abnormality in the autonomic nervous system, including the adrenergic, cholinergic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonadrenergic-noncholinergic (NANC) innervation of the nose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. However, such abnormalities have also been demonstrated in some inflammatory cases and in this context, have been proposed to be secondary to a primary inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/7,8,12,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,12,29</a>]. Thus, the pathogenic role of these abnormalities is unclear.</p><p>&quot;Gustatory rhinitis&quot; is a term applied to the development of profuse, watery rhinorrhea or congestion in association with eating hot or spicy foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prominent rhinorrhea without other symptoms'</a> below). It is most likely a subtype of noninflammatory NAR.</p><p>Patients with noninflammatory, nonallergic rhinitis may display the following abnormal neurologic findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal responses to various neurogenic stimulation, including heightened responses (in the form of rhinitis symptoms) to histamine, cold stimulation of the extremities and nasal mucosa, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, and other stimuli designed to activate cholinergic responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/7,10,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished responses to vasoconstrictive stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased concentrations of intranasal neuropeptides, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and substance P [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to these neural processes, nasal secretory abnormalities may also be important to the pathogenesis of NAR. In one study, subjects with allergic rhinitis secreted higher amounts of albumin and an unidentified 26 kilodalton protein than did those with NAR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Since production of the latter protein could be stimulated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a>, it was thought to occur in secretory mucosal glands. This implies that there is a qualitative difference in the glandular mucosa, which may distinguish patients with allergic rhinitis from those with NAR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonallergic rhinitis with nasal eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) is the most common type of inflammatory NAR. The clear nasal secretions in these patients contain greater than 25 percent eosinophils. Nasal biopsies from these patients commonly show increased eosinophils, as well as increased numbers of mast cells and prominent mast cell degranulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]. The presence of eosinophils in nasal secretions can be assessed in the office by having the patient blow the nose into a piece of &quot;wax paper&quot; and applying the secretions onto a glass slide. Once dried, the secretions are stained with Wright's stain and examined under a light microscope. Although not considered essential for the diagnosis, the author has performed this examination for years and has found that a high eosinophil count usually predicts a good response to intranasal glucocorticoids (INGCs).</p><p>The cellular inflammatory infiltrate may have dominant cells other than eosinophils. Nasal cytology, in some cases, shows a predominance of mast cells and neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. There may also be an increase in mucus-producing cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These histologic findings may be associated with different clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In one study, the burden of inflammatory cells correlated with impaired quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. As noted above, the presence of eosinophilia can indicate responsiveness to glucocorticoids. It may also be associated with a higher incidence of asthma and more severe symptoms than when the predominant pattern is characterized by neutrophilia. When mast cells are the predominant cell type, nasal itching is often a characteristic feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The inflammatory cytokine pattern in chronic NAR may differ from that in normals. In a study comparing patients with allergic rhinitis, NAR, and controls (45 included in each group), both the patient groups had increased levels of interleukin-16 (IL-16) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Another study of proteomic analysis of nasal swab specimens demonstrated a distinction between specimens obtained from allergic versus nonallergic rhinitis subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence for a localized allergic response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic NAR have negative skin and in vitro tests for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), by definition, and thus lack evidence of increased systemic production of allergen-specific IgE. However, IgE production may occur locally in the nasal tissue in patients with negative skin tests, as well as in patients with typical allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/2,44-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,44-51</a>]. One group of investigators has shown that up to one-half of patients with chronic NAR react to nasal challenge with allergen, especially dust mite allergen, with symptoms and signs similar to those in patients with typical allergic rhinitis and significantly different from controls without rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/45,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,52,53</a>]. Local IgE production in the nasal mucosa has been demonstrated to additional allergens, including pollens, animal epithelia, molds (<em>Alternaria</em>), and others. Basophils from peripheral blood may be activated by the involved allergens, suggesting spillover of locally synthesized specific IgE into the circulation. Because of these findings, some authors have suggested performing an allergen-specific nasal challenge and measuring the (local) nasal-specific IgE levels in addition to standard allergy tests in this subgroup of patients. In addition, they recommend repeating allergy skin testing &quot;after a time interval,&quot; since patients formerly diagnosed with NAR may develop allergic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p>It is possible that the production of local allergen-specific IgE in patients with symptoms of rhinitis is simply a precursor to the development of the systemic production of these IgE antibodies. A prospective 10-year follow-up study with initial cohorts of 194 patients with local allergic rhinitis and 130 healthy controls was designed to answer this question. After 10 years of follow-up, 176 patients remained, and skin prick tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum-specific IgE became positive in only 9.7 percent of those with local allergic rhinitis and in 7.8 percent of controls. The authors interpreted these findings as indicating that local allergic rhinitis is a separate condition from classic allergic rhinitis and <strong>not</strong> simply a precursor phase of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, other researchers (using similar techniques) were either unable to demonstrate consistent responses to nasal allergen challenge in patients with NAR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>] or found the same responses in healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. These findings challenge the concept that NAR results from a localized, IgE-mediated mechanism. An alternative explanation could be nonspecific hyper-reactivity of the nasal mucosa due to inflammation from another etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rhinitis, in both its allergic and nonallergic forms, affects 10 to 40 percent of the population in industrialized countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Pure chronic NAR may be responsible for anywhere from 17 to 52 percent of all cases of rhinitis in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/4,62-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,62-69</a>]. The prevalence of NAR in children is less well-studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/70-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-73</a>]. Much of the data utilized to establish the prevalence of chronic NAR have been gathered from allergy specialty practices, although there have been some community-based epidemiologic surveys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/62-66,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-66,74,75</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of pure NAR underestimates the impact of this condition, since it coexists with allergic rhinitis in a substantial subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Patients with both conditions have been described as having &quot;mixed&quot; rhinitis, although they are generally classified as allergic since there is no established United States diagnostic code for &quot;mixed&quot; allergic and nonallergic disease.</p><p>In addition, in the presence of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), it is difficult to establish the existence of concomitant NAR. The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters in Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology has estimated that, taking this underestimation into account, approximately 50 percent of patients presenting with rhinitis may have the nonallergic form (alone or as mixed disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Based upon a survey of American allergists, 34 percent of 975 rhinitis patients were identified as having the &quot;mixed&quot; form of rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Extrapolating these data to the overall incidence of rhinitis in the United States revealed that NAR may affect as many as 17 million Americans and that an additional 22 million may suffer from the &quot;mixed form&quot; of rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1685189\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NAR presents later in life than allergic rhinitis, with 70 percent of patients presenting after 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/65,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,76</a>]. In comparison, the onset of allergic rhinitis usually occurs before age 20 (and often in childhood).</p><p>Women make up the majority of patients in most studies, so there may be a female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/63,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,77</a>].</p><p>Rhinitis of older adults (also called senile rhinitis) is a term used to describe NAR in older patients. It is characterized by prominent rhinorrhea and aggravated by eating and environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

In contrast, patients with allergic rhinitis report prominent eye symptoms, sneezing, and rhinorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with NAR often cannot readily identify triggers, such as times of year when specific pollens are prevalent or exposure to animals. In contrast, most patients with allergic rhinitis can identify one or more triggers. (See <a href=\"#H578257771\" class=\"local\">'Characteristic triggers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms most commonly occur throughout the year (eg, perennial), although the condition may be exacerbated by weather conditions, particularly during the spring and fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Symptoms in those with allergic disease usually show seasonal patterns, although some have perennial symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with NAR suffer from comorbidities, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media, sleep disturbance, and declines in quality of life, similar to those with allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/41,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,81</a>]. Studies examining the relationship between NAR and asthma are reviewed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H4249291176\" class=\"local\">'Relationship with asthma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H578257771\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristic triggers</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory irritants (eg, cigarette smoking, strong scents, and fragrances) are prominent inducers of symptoms, although this may be true for patients with longstanding allergic rhinitis also.

In a study using a unique environmental exposure chamber designed to simulate various weather conditions, 37 subjects were challenged with cold, dry air, and temperature changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Nasal patency was assessed with acoustic rhinometry and rhinorrhea, by measurement of nasal secretions. In addition, subjective measures of nasal symptoms were also evaluated. Significant symptoms with objective confirmation were induced in response to these simulated weather changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heated or spicy foods induce watery rhinorrhea in patients with the syndrome of gustatory rhinitis, which can be considered a subtype of NAR. Food triggers are more common in older adults, and gustatory rhinitis and rhinitis of older adults overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prominent rhinorrhea without other symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4249291176\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship with asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NAR, like allergic rhinitis, is associated with asthma and is a significant risk factor for the development of asthma. Some studies have found that NAR confers a lower risk of asthma compared with allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>], while others have found similar rates of asthma development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There may be subsets of patients with NAR that are at particularly elevated risk for asthma. Those with inflammatory NAR with increased nasal eosinophilia appear to be at greater risk for the development of asthma than patients with NAR without eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/13,86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,86,87</a>]. Those with eosinophilia not only have a comparatively elevated risk for asthma but also a greater risk for the development of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> sensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nasal turbinates can appear boggy and edematous in both allergic rhinitis and NAR. The mucosal tissue is more often erythematous in nonallergic disease as compared with the pale-bluish hue or pallor seen with allergic rhinitis. However, none of these findings is diagnostic, and the mucosa can even appear relatively normal, particularly in older patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of chronic NAR is based on a characteristic history and physical examination, combined with the absence of evidence for clinical allergy to aeroallergens. It is therefore a diagnosis of exclusion. However, in practical terms, allergy testing is not essential to making a presumptive initial diagnosis of NAR and beginning therapy. In addition, allergic rhinitis and NAR can coexist, and in such cases, it may only become clear that the patient has both disorders in retrospect once an effective combination of medications is found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4107301\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral for allergy testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not necessary to perform allergy testing before making a presumptive diagnosis of NAR and initiating treatment as previously mentioned. However, if the patient is not experiencing adequate improvement, then testing for allergy is indicated to clarify the etiology.</p><p>Allergy testing can be accomplished either through skin testing or with blood tests. In general, skin testing with aeroallergens is the more sensitive and specific of the two methods, but it should only be performed by an allergy expert, and thus, referral is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The other method of identifying allergic sensitivities is immunoassays to detect allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the serum. These tests are widely available and require no patient preparation (such as discontinuation of medications). IgE immunoassays provide similar information as that obtained with allergen skin tests, although they are variably more expensive and less sensitive for the diagnosis of allergy to inhalant allergens compared with skin tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-in-vitro-allergy-tests#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of in vitro allergy tests&quot;, section on 'Accuracy'</a>.)</p><p>In evaluating patients for allergy, clinicians should be mindful that a positive skin test for allergy or a positive in vitro test by itself does not prove that the patient is allergic to that substance. The result must be consistent with the clinical history, with symptoms occurring during the appropriate season, or upon exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of limited panels of IgE immunoassays in the primary care setting has been evaluated in the diagnosis and management of rhinitis. Such testing can improve diagnostic accuracy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> management when skin testing is not easily obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/88-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">88-90</a>].

The most common form of medication-induced rhinitis is that caused by excessive use of over-the-counter decongestant nasal sprays, which is a disorder called rhinitis medicamentosa. Physical examination in patients with rhinitis medicamentosa often reveals swollen, red nasal mucous membranes. Diagnosis most heavily relies upon the history of use of a causative medication.</p><p>In some patients, even several days of regular use of decongestant sprays leads to rebound nasal congestion as the medication wears off, prompting patients to administer the medicine more frequently to obtain relief. This begins a vicious cycle of nasal congestion both caused and temporarily relieved by the medication with escalating use and eventual dependency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>Treatment of rhinitis medicamentosa begins with withdrawal of the causative medication. In addition, an intranasal glucocorticoid (INGC) is usually required to reduce symptoms while patients discontinue the culprit decongestant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/94-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-97</a>]. It is important to counsel patients that nasal congestion will probably worsen temporarily as the offending medication is stopped so that this is not interpreted as treatment failure. Intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> was shown in a small randomized trial of 19 patients to be effective in countering rebound nasal congestion in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Topical INGCs achieve high concentrations of the drug in the affected mucosa and are the most appropriate long-term therapy. Complete recovery can take as long as one year in cases of long-term overuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].</p><p>A brief course of oral glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 0.5 mg per kg for five days) has also been proposed for treatment during withdrawal in some case reports. This is helpful when nasal congestion is sufficiently severe that topical therapies cannot penetrate up into the nose.

As an example, in two multicenter randomized open-label trials, approximately 80 to 85 percent of more than 200 subjects with chronic NAR responded favorably to azelastine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p>The improvement in symptoms with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelastine</a> is likely due to anti-inflammatory actions.

(See <a href=\"#H4249291176\" class=\"local\">'Relationship with asthma'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, 24 percent had developed allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) (most commonly to dust mite and animal epithelia). Thus, over time, chronic NAR may involve the lower airways in some patients, leading to asthma, and can also progress to allergic rhinitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H874347618\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The pathogenesis is not well-characterized. Other terms for this condition include vasomotor rhinitis, idiopathic rhinitis, nonallergic-noninfectious rhinitis, and intrinsic rhinitis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As many as 50 percent of patients presenting with rhinitis may have NAR, either alone or in combination with allergic rhinitis or other forms of rhinitis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NAR can be best distinguished from other forms of rhinitis with a detailed clinical history. Compared with allergic rhinitis, NAR has a later age of onset (usually after age 20) and more prominent nasal congestion and postnasal drainage. Patients often identify weather conditions or nonspecific respiratory irritants (eg, cigarette smoke) as exacerbating factors. Symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are absent. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gustatory rhinitis is a subtype of NAR that presents as watery rhinorrhea in response to eating, particularly upon ingestion of heated or spicy foods. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis is based upon characteristic historic features, physical exam findings, and the absence of evidence of sensitivity to aeroallergens. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, although it may coexist with other forms of rhinitis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild symptoms of NAR, we recommend either an intranasal glucocorticoid (INGC) or an intranasal antihistamine spray (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Primary therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms, we suggest combination therapy with <strong>both</strong> INGCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55833 \">table 2</a>) and intranasal antihistamines, rather than monotherapy with either agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We find that most patients require both agents daily for adequate symptom control. We start with full-strength doses of both agents and reduce the doses over time as symptoms improve. A combination spray containing both glucocorticoid and antihistamine is also available. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Primary therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> nasal spray for patients with prominent watery rhinorrhea without other symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Isolated rhinorrhea is typical of gustatory rhinitis and rhinitis of older adults. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prominent rhinorrhea without other symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with NAR and prominent nasal congestion that is refractory to INGCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55833 \">table 2</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelastine</a>, or a combination of both, we suggest adding over-the-counter oral decongestants on an as-needed basis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pseudoephedrine</a> is commonly employed, but should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily nasal saline irrigation is a helpful adjunctive therapy for patients with NAR and other forms of rhinitis who find the maneuver comfortable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71059\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71059 \">table 3</a>). Regular use of over-the-counter nasal saline sprays may also benefit some patients.
