Bacteremia due to gram-negative bacilli is a significant problem in both hospitalized and community-dwelling patients. These organisms pose serious therapeutic problems because of the increasing incidence of multidrug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Gram-negative bacillary sepsis with shock has a mortality rate of 12 to 38 percent; mortality varies depending, in part, on whether the patient receives timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of gram-negative bacillary bacteremia will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of infections due to specific gram-negative bacilli are discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p>Gram-negative bacteremia is a frequent cause of sepsis, which often must be managed prior to the receipt of microbiological data. Antibiotic treatment in the setting of sepsis in general is discussed in detail elsewhere. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5796030\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gram-negative bacilli are the cause of approximately a quarter to a half of all bloodstream infections, depending on geographic region, whether the onset of the infection is in the hospital or community, and other patient risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5795948\"><span class=\"h3\">Hospital-onset infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gram-negative bacilli were once the predominant organisms associated with hospital-onset bloodstream infections in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Since the 1980s, gram-positive aerobes (eg, coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and enterococci), and <em>Candida</em> species have increased in relative importance. This change was especially evident in the intensive care unit (ICU) population and thought to be largely driven by device-related infections. In the United States, the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System reported that from 1986 to 2003 the proportion of bloodstream infections in ICU patients caused by gram-negative pathogens remained stable at approximately 25 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similarly, subsequent data from the United States National Healthcare Safety Network demonstrated that approximately a quarter of reported central line-associated bloodstream infections from 2009 to 2010 were caused by gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In contrast to this stable trend, several single center studies have reported increases in the proportion of gram-negative pathogens among patients with catheter-related bacteremia. As an example, a single large United States tertiary care hospital reported a significant increase in the proportion of gram-negative bloodstream infections from 15.9 percent in 1999 to 24.1 percent in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Several subsequent reports from European hospitals have shown an upward trend in the proportion of gram-negative catheter-related bloodstream infections as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Increasing proportions of gram-negative and yeast catheter-related bloodstream infections in these studies may be related to improved prevention efforts aimed at gram-positive central line infections, increasing antimicrobial resistance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in surveillance practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/6,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,12</a>]. Several of these factors are impacted by local infection prevention practices and the prevalence of drug-resistance, which may explain variable trends at individual hospitals.</p><p>Globally, the proportion of bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacilli differs by geographic region. As an example, data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program from 1997 to 2002 demonstrated that the proportion of bacteremia caused by gram-negative bacilli was greater in Europe (43 percent) and Latin America (44 percent), than that identified in North America (35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a study from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, the reported frequency of bacteremia due to <em>Escherichia coli</em> increased by 8.1 percent per year from 2002 to 2008, with the additional caseload attributed to increasing antimicrobial resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a Brazilian multicenter study of 2563 patients with hospital-onset bacteremia, 58.5 percent of infections were due to gram-negative organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Seasonality and the effect of warmer climates may partially explain these geographical differences. Several studies have demonstrated seasonal trends in gram-negative bacilli bacteremia in multiple continents and involving various pathogens, including <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp, <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em> spp, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. As examples, the incidence of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and <em>Acinetobacter</em> infections has been observed to increase by 17 percent for each 10&deg;F (5.6&deg;C) increase in external temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In another study, the estimated proportion of gram-negative pathogens isolated from blood cultures in varied geographic locations demonstrated both seasonal trends and increased rates in locations closer to the equator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The proportion of gross domestic product devoted to health spending was also a significant predictor, suggesting that socioeconomic factors may also play a role in the incidence of gram-negative bacteremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5795975\"><span class=\"h3\">Community-onset infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gram-negative bacilli cause a higher proportion of community-onset than hospital-onset bacteremias, since community-onset bacteremias are more likely related to primary infections of the urinary tract, abdomen, and respiratory tract as opposed to device-related infections. In a study from two tertiary care centers in the United States, 45 percent of community-onset bloodstream infections were due to gram-negative bacilli in contrast to 31 percent of hospital-onset infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a systematic review of studies from South and Southeast Asia that included 3506 patients with community-onset bacteremia, gram-negative organisms were the cause in 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Gram-negative bacteremia in community-dwelling patients frequently occurs in the elderly. In a retrospective review of 238 patients older than 65 years with bacteremia, 81 percent of whom were admitted from home, a gram-negative organism was the etiologic agent in 36 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most hospitalized patients with gram-negative bacteremia have at least one comorbid condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In a study of 326 patients with gram-negative bacteremia, comorbid conditions were identified in 315 (97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

As an example, one prospective study identified urinary retention and recent urogenital surgery as host factors independently associated with the risk of bacteremia in 156 hospitalized patients with <em>E. coli</em> bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other important procedure-related risk factors for gram-negative bacteremia include prostate biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>In addition to these risk factors, combat-injured military personnel and patients injured during natural disasters involving trauma in water are also at increased risk for infections caused by gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. </p><p>Certain environmental gram-negative pathogens may cause hospital or medication-related outbreaks of bacteremia. As an example, a multi-state outbreak of <em>Serratia</em> bacteremia in the United States was attributed to contaminated intravenous medications from a centrally distributing pharmacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Another small, single-institution outbreak of bacteremia with <em>Burkholderia contaminans</em>, an uncommonly reported isolate, was traced to contaminated intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> prepared at a compounding pharmacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Among critically ill patients, for example, common sources of gram-negative bacteremia include the respiratory tract and central venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In contrast, several studies of elderly patients in the community, in nursing homes, or admitted to hospitals, have identified the urinary tract as the most frequent source of gram-negative bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Infections of the gastrointestinal tract, biliary tract, and skin or soft tissues are less frequent sources of bloodstream infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of specific gram-negative bacilli responsible for bacteremia differs by whether the onset of the infection is in the hospital or community and by the likely primary source of infection.</p><p>In a study of 179 cases of hospital-onset gram-negative bacillary bacteremia identified from a large database of acute care hospitals in the United States, the following distribution of pathogens was noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>E. coli</em> &ndash; 18 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> &ndash; 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> &ndash; 8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Proteus</em> species &ndash; 1 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other gram-negative bacteria &ndash; 56 percent</p><p/><p>Among intensive care unit (ICU) patients, the proportion of gram-negative bacteremia caused by <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is frequently higher. Patients in the ICU frequently are on or have recently been on antibiotics, which increase the risk of infections with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and other nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, such as <em>Acinetobacter</em> species, that have intrinsic or acquired resistance to commonly used agents. As an example, in a study that included 45 cases of hospital-onset bacteremias in an ICU in Canada, the following distribution was noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> &ndash; 22.2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Enterobacter</em> species &ndash; 22.2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> &ndash; 17.8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>E. coli</em> &ndash; 15.6 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Serratia marcescens</em> &ndash; 11.1 percent</p><p/><p>In contrast, infections with <em>E. coli</em> predominate in cases of community-onset gram-negative bacteremia, as illustrated in a study of 2796 consecutive cases of bacteremia in Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The distribution of the approximately 570 community-onset gram-negative cases was as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>E. coli</em> &ndash; 76 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> &ndash; 7.9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> &ndash; 5.4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Proteus mirabilis</em> &ndash; 4.2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Enterobacter</em> species &ndash; 3.7 percent</p><p/><p>These differences reflect the observation that the urinary tract, in which <em>E. coli</em> is the most common pathogen, is the most common source for community-onset gram-negative bacteremia, whereas infections of the urinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts contribute more equally to hospital-onset bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Patients who have significant health care exposures (eg, nursing home, dialysis center, recent hospitalization, or surgery) but are not in an acute care hospital at the time of infection onset can be classified separately as having health care-associated, community-onset infections. The distribution of pathogens causing bacteremia among such patients reflects a hybrid between the pure hospital- or community-onset distributions above. This is illustrated by a study of 306 cases of health care-associated, community-onset gram-negative bloodstream infections in Minnesota that demonstrated the following organism frequencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>E. coli</em> &ndash; 47.4 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> &ndash; 14.7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> &ndash; 9.2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Enterobacter</em> species &ndash; 6.5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. mirabilis</em> &ndash; 4.2 percent</p><p/><p>Other organisms should be considered depending on the geographical region or specific epidemiological exposures. As an example, <em>Salmonella</em> species are an important cause of community-onset bacteremia in resource-limited countries in Asia and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16356979\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of gram-negative bacteremia is increasingly complicated by the rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli strains. Normally, susceptible Enterobacteriaceae become resistant to antimicrobial agents by acquiring resistance genes from other bacteria or through mutation and selection. Other pathogens such as <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>Acinetobacter</em> <em>baumannii</em>, and <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em> have inherent resistance and may acquire additional mechanisms for resistance. Multidrug-resistant pathogens <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the genetic elements of resistance can be spread from person-to-person and bacterial species-to-species.</p><p>The burden of antimicrobial resistance among bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative organisms is substantial. As an example, among the 27,766 central-line associated bloodstream infections reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) in the United States between 2009 and 2010, the prevalence of resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics was measured as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> &ndash; 29 and 13 percent resistant to third or fourth generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>E. coli</em> &ndash; 42, 19, and 2 percent resistant to fluoroquinolones, third or fourth generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Enterobacter</em> spp &ndash; 37 percent resistant to third or fourth generation cephalosporins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> &ndash; 31, 26, and 26 percent resistant to fluoroquinolones, third or fourth generation cephalosporins, and carbapenems, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>A. baumannii</em> &ndash; 67 percent resistant to carbapenems </p><p/><p>Additionally, there has been emergence and dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases. </p><p>These multidrug-resistant pathogens are no longer limited solely to acute care hospitals. Patients are frequently infected or colonized with these pathogens in the community and in long term care facilities, and then import them into the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. As an example, a single long term acute care center was the ultimate source for 60 percent of carbapenemase-producing <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infections in an outbreak that involved 40 patients in 26 facilities in the greater-Chicago area in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16356985\"><span class=\"h2\">Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) confer resistance to beta lactam agents.

A metallo-B-lactamase, the New Delhi metallo-B-lactamase lactamase (NDM-1), was discovered in 2009 and has subsequently been identified in numerous other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. As of 2013, nine states in the US have reported cases of NDM-1 infections. Additionally, OXA-48, a Class D carbapenemase typically found in <em>A. baumannii</em>, was described for the first time in <em>K. pneumoniae</em> in a patient in Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Outbreaks of infection due to this pathogen have subsequently been identified. </p><p>Overall, the most important risk factor for development of infection due to a carbapenemase-producing organism is receipt of prior antimicrobial therapy. </p><p>Treatment of serious infections, such as bacteremia, with a carbapenem-resistant organism is difficult, as such organisms often have resistance genes for other antibiotics outside the beta-lactam class, and thus effective antibiotic options are limited. A combination regimen including two or more agents is often warranted. Management of patients with infections due to carbapenemase-producing organisms should be done in consultation with an expert in the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria and is discussed in detail elsewhere. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with gram-negative rod bacteremia typically present with fever. Although patients can present with or without chills, the presence of shaking chills (rigors) may be an important early clinical clue that a febrile patient is bacteremic, as illustrated by a study of 396 febrile patients seen in an emergency room, of whom 60 were bacteremic (with a gram-negative organism in 42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A complaint of shaking chills (rigors) was independently associated with bloodstream infection (odds ratio [OR] 14). </p><p>Disorientation, hypotension, and respiratory failure may complicate bacteremia and are usually signs that the patient may be developing sepsis and septic shock, which is seen in about 25 percent of patients on presentation with gram-negative rod bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients may rarely present with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, such as petechiae and purpura, although this finding is more frequently seen in meningococcemia.

Similarly, a splenectomized patient may present with a spontaneous bacteremia and unknown primary source. Finally, central venous catheter-related infections may present with fever and no obvious exit site infection on exam. These patients may not have an obvious primary site of infection and fever may be the only manifestation of the bacteremia.

Patients with gram-negative bacteremia may specifically benefit from these rapid tests due to the wide range of possible infecting pathogens and the possibility of either intrinsic or acquired drug resistance.

Empiric therapy occurs when an infection is suspected but not yet confirmed.

In other cases, use of a single agent is likely sufficient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89418\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89418 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The rationale for the use of two drugs is that mortality from gram-negative bacteremia is increased when patients receive inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy and the role of a second agent may thus be to cover possible resistant pathogens when resistance rates to the primary agent are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/2,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,81</a>]. In a retrospective study of 286 patients from Korea with antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteremia, receipt of initial inappropriate therapy was associated with higher mortality rates than receipt of at least one antimicrobial agent to which the causative organism was susceptible (38.4 versus 27.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similarly, in a retrospective study of 760 patients with septic shock due to gram-negative bacteremia, mortality rates were lower among patients who received appropriate compared with inappropriate empiric therapy (36 versus 52 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Patients who received two agents were more likely to receive appropriate therapy (78 versus 64 percent in patients who received one agent), but combination therapy was not associated with lower mortality. Of note, treatment with a fluoroquinolone provided only minimal additional coverage when added to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>, a carbapenem, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>.</p><p>This theoretical advantage of combination therapy, however, has not been supported by other studies. In a meta-analysis of 64 trials of empiric antibiotic regimens in sepsis, the addition of an aminoglycoside to a beta-lactam did not provide any mortality benefit over the beta-lactam alone but was associated with more toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Similarly, in a meta-analysis of two randomized trials and 15 observational studies of patients with gram-negative bacteremia, combination therapy was not associated with a decrease in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In a subsequent trial, 600 patients with sepsis or septic shock in 44 ICUs in Germany were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> or meropenem plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Outcomes including mortality, length of hospitalization, and degree of organ failure were similar between the two groups, but patients who received combination therapy had higher rates of adverse events.</p><p>Additionally, studies evaluating the use of combination therapy for the treatment of infections due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> have yielded conflicting results, and there remains considerable controversy surrounding the need for two versus one agent for treatment of <em>Pseudomonas</em> bacteremia. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections#H6675458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of antimicrobial therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections&quot;, section on 'Combination antimicrobial therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections#H371759579\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of antimicrobial therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections&quot;, section on 'Indications for combination therapy'</a>.) </p><p>Thus, since widespread use of combination antimicrobial therapy does not appear to be clinically beneficial, we do not use it routinely. Instead, we limit its use to those patients who are most likely to have drug-resistant infections and those for whom inappropriate antibiotic therapy would presumably be associated with an especially high mortality. The potential benefit for combination therapy is likely greatest in these groups. In particular, patients with immunosuppression, especially severe neutropenia, are at higher risk of mortality associated with delay in active therapy for bloodstream infections and mortality related to Pseudomonas bloodstream infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. Bone marrow transplant recipients also suffer higher rates of drug resistance due to use of antibiotic prophylaxis and empiric therapies for neutropenic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>].</p><p>Ultimately, treating clinicians must understand local resistance patterns, evaluate the individual patient, and determine their own level of suspicion for drug-resistant gram-negative infection to justify use of combination therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Directed therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367049203\"><span class=\"h3\">Regimen choice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once final culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility data are available, therapy should be tailored to the specific pathogen based upon the susceptibility results. If combination therapy was used empirically, the regimen should generally be switched to a single agent with the narrowest spectrum to which the organism is susceptible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. There is concern that routine use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of the hospitalized patient leads to the selection of organisms resistant to those agents, as observed in the emergence of carbapenem-resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, and <em>Acinetobacter</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/90-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-93</a>]. Thus, narrowing the antimicrobial spectrum based on culture results preserves the most broad-spectrum agents for treatment of multidrug-resistant pathogens.</p><p>In some cases, however, a more broadly active antibiotic may be the drug of choice for directed therapy even if the organism tests susceptible to an agent with a narrower spectrum. As an example, whether organisms that produce an inducible chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase (eg, <em>Enterobacter</em>, <em>Serratia</em>, <em>Citrobacter</em>, indole-positive <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Providencia</em>, <em>Morganella</em>) can be successfully treated with a third-generation cephalosporin or a <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-lactam/beta-lactamase</span> inhibitor remains uncertain. Most of this concern is theoretical, supported largely by in vitro data with limited information on whether this phenomenon actually leads to clinical failure in patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Furthermore, despite the presence of AmpC beta-lactamases in several human pathogens, relevant clinical data are limited to observational studies in which a higher risk of clinical failure has been demonstrated with bacteremia or meningitis due to <em>Enterobacter</em> spp treated with third-generation cephalosporins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>] and in a small number of patients in whom <em>Serratia</em> and <em>Citrobacter</em> developed resistance during therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. For most patients with gram-negative bacteremia due to AmpC producers, we believe that following susceptibility data and using a beta-lactam drug to which the organisms test susceptible is adequate. However, we prefer treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> or a carbapenem when the primary infection is in the central nervous system (CNS) or another sequestered site which may not receive adequate drug penetration or the planned treatment course is long (&gt;14 days). Repeat susceptibility testing for subsequently identified isolates is necessary to detect evidence of emerging resistance during the course of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. For non-CNS infections with AmpC producers that have confirmed susceptibility in vitro, use of quinolones avoids beta-lactamase induction and remains a good option for directed treatment of bloodstream infections due to excellent bioavailability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta-lactam antibiotics: Mechanisms of action and resistance and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Chromosomal beta-lactamases'</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, for organisms that produce an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, carbapenems are associated with the best outcomes in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] and remain the drug class of choice, even though some of these strains may appear susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-lactam/beta-lactamase</span> inhibitor combinations, or other agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases&quot;, section on 'Treatment options'</a>.) </p><p>Furthermore, even though most infections can be treated successfully with a single agent, some infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens warrant a combination regimen for directed therapy. As an example, polymyxins such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> are often combined with other agents when used to treat carbapenem-resistant pathogens due to the emergence of resistance to colistin during therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].

Most hospitalized patients with gram-negative bacteremia have at least one comorbid condition, such as diabetes, liver or kidney failure, and immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of specific gram-negative bacilli responsible for bacteremia differs by whether the onset of the infection is in the hospital or community and by the likely primary source of infection. As an example, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> is a frequent pathogen in hospital-onset infections, particularly those that occur in intensive care unit patients. In contrast, community-acquired infections are most often secondary to urinary tract infections, among which <em>Escherichia coli</em> predominate. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Source of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with gram-negative bacillary bacteremia typically present with fever. Disorientation, hypotension, and respiratory failure may complicate bacteremia and are usually signs that the patient may be developing septic shock, which is seen in about 25 percent of patients on presentation with gram-negative rod bacteremia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia rarely occurs spontaneously without infection at another site, and thus additional clinical manifestations will vary by the site of the primary infection. Exceptions include neutropenic patients, among whom cytotoxic chemotherapy can cause mucosal injury that allows bacteria to cross mucosal membranes and enter the bloodstream, and central venous catheter-related infections that can present without an obvious exit site infection. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia is diagnosed when there is growth of a gram-negative bacillus on blood culture. Obtaining and interpreting blood cultures when bacteremia is suspected is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood cultures for the detection of bacteremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of gram-negative bacteremia is increasingly complicated by the occurrence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli strains, which is substantial and increasing. Additionally, multidrug-resistant pathogens are no longer limited to acute care hospitals and frequently infect or colonize patients in the community who have significant health care exposures and those in long-term care facilities. (See <a href=\"#H16356979\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of gram-negative bacillary bacteremia includes urgent empiric antibiotics, supportive care, careful monitoring of patients, and control of the source of infection, which may require surgical drainage or removal of an intravascular catheter. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of empiric antibiotics should consider the patient's history, including recent antimicrobial exposure, comorbidities, clinical syndrome, prior health care exposures, Gram stain data, and previous culture results. Other important management decisions include whether to empirically cover <em>P. aeruginosa</em> or other multidrug-resistant organisms and when to employ combination antimicrobial therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89418\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89418 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Empiric antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with gram-negative bacillary bacteremia who do not have signs of sepsis or septic shock, recommended regimens depend on the presence of immune suppression or health care exposures. Example regimens are listed above. (See <a href=\"#H114442821\" class=\"local\">'Patients without sepsis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24171748\" class=\"local\">'Indications and rationale for coverage of P. aeruginosa'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For empiric therapy of immunocompetent patients without health care exposures, we recommend a single broad-spectrum antibiotic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Antipseudomonal activity is generally not necessary. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For empiric therapy of patients with immunosuppression or health care exposures, we recommend a single broad-spectrum antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there are no direct data demonstrating benefit of combination therapy, use of two agents increases the likelihood that empiric therapy will be effective against the infecting organism. Thus, we favor combination antimicrobial therapy in a select subset of patients who are most likely to have an infection with a drug-resistant organism and for whom inappropriate antibiotic therapy would presumably be associated with an especially high mortality:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Therefore, for patients with sepsis or septic shock in the setting of gram-negative bacteremia who also have immunosuppression, have other risk factors for <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, or are at hospitals where the level of resistance to the chosen empiric gram-negative agent among the most common gram-negative pathogens exceeds 10 to 20 percent, we suggest empiric therapy with a combination of two antipseudomonal agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with sepsis or septic shock in the setting of gram-negative bacteremia who do not have any of these additional risk factors for resistant organisms, we recommend treatment with a single antipseudomonal agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Example regimens are listed above. (See <a href=\"#H114442863\" class=\"local\">'Patients with sepsis or septic shock'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Indications and rationale for combination therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility data are available, we typically narrow coverage so that therapy is pathogen-directed based upon the susceptibility results. The duration of therapy should be determined by the clinical response of the patient and the source and extent of infection. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Directed therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reported mortality rate of patients with gram-negative bacteremia ranges from 12 to 38 percent. This is even higher among those who also have sepsis. Although difficult to assess, infection with drug-resistant organisms is associated with greater mortality, as well. (See <a href=\"#H367049451\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.) </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Su&aacute;rez CJ, Lolans K, Villegas MV, Quinn JP.
