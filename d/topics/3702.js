The management of CHD in women in general and specific information regarding young women are discussed separately.

Although there has been a reduction in the death rate from CHD since 1980, it accounted for 22 percent of all-cause mortality in women in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Between the ages of 45 and 64, one in nine women develop symptoms of some form of cardiovascular disease. After age 65, the ratio climbs to one in three women, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Additional epidemiologic information and issues related to prognosis are found elsewhere.

It may be a stable pattern of chest pain (stable angina), an acute coronary syndrome, heart failure (HF), or sudden cardiac death (SCD). Rarely, there are no symptoms and the initial presentation is an abnormal cardiac test such as an electrocardiogram or echocardiogram ordered for another reason. </p><p>This section will discuss how female sex may lead to presentation and diagnosis that differs somewhat from those in men. The broad discussions of presentations and diagnosis of CHD are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care#H3688853548\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Third universal definition of MI'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the survivor of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Women may not identify their initial symptoms as an expression of heart disease and therefore may not seek medical advice promptly. In addition, practitioners may not evaluate symptoms that represent myocardial ischemia as early in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cardiovascular risk factors in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with CHD are generally about 10 years older than men at the time of presentation and carry a greater burden of risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. However, women younger than age 45 years also develop CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms of ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While differences between women and men in the description of ischemic symptoms have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], we believe that there are more similarities than differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>Chest pain is the most common anginal symptom in both sexes and is described similarly with regard to quality of pain (heaviness, pressure),&nbsp;pattern of radiation, and many associated symptoms (fatigue, nausea, etc). Indeed, in an analysis of the PROMISE trial, women presenting in the outpatient setting were as likely as men to report chest pain as their primary symptom, and were more likely to describe the pain as <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;crushing/pressure/squeezing/tightness&quot;</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a study of 109 women and 128 men with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) with or without angina and at least one prior abnormal cardiac test result who underwent coronary arteriography, the rates of the use of the following descriptors of chest pain were similar between women and men who were found to have obstructive CAD: &quot;chest pain&quot; (84 versus 82 percent), &quot;pressure&quot; (58 versus 54 percent), and &quot;tightness&quot; (58 versus 43 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similar findings have been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], while older studies based on patients undergoing testing suggest that women may have more atypical pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>One potential important factor in the interpretation of symptoms, and in particular chest pain, in women is the greater likelihood of their being induced by rest, sleep, and mental stress, in addition to or instead of physical exertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe that there are more similarities than differences between women and men in the presentation of myocardial infarction (MI) (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms of ischemia'</a> above). Most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], studies support this point. </p><p>A prospective cohort study evaluated 796 women and 1679 men who presented to an emergency department within 12 hours of the onset of acute chest pain (a diagnosis of MI was given in about 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thirty-four predefined chest pain characteristics were recorded for each patient, including location and size of the area of pain, pain quality, radiation, onset, duration, dynamics, severity, and the aggravating and relieving factors including response to nitrates. Most of these characteristics were reported with similar frequency in women and men, including the subpopulation of individuals who were diagnosed with MI. </p><p>However, women who present with MI may more frequently present without chest pain. The following studies are illustrative of this point:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort study of 1015 patients (30 percent women) 55 years of age or younger who were evaluated for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the percent of patients who presented without chest pain was significantly greater in women (19.0 versus 13.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients without chest pain reported fewer symptoms overall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 515 women with an acute MI, acute chest pain was absent in 43 percent, and only 30 percent experienced prodromal chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of over 1,000,000 women and men in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (United States), the proportion of MI patients who presented without chest pain was significantly higher for women than men (42.0 versus 30.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p>MI in women may go unrecognized, particularly at younger ages and when compared with men: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of unrecognized MI was illustrated in a report from Iceland in which 13,000 women were followed for 29 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The incidence of MI on the electrocardiogram (ECG) increased from 1.3 per 1000 at age 35 to 60 per 1000 at age 75; the proportion that was unrecognized was higher in the younger women (41 versus 24 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher proportion of silent Q wave infarctions in older women was noted in a report from the HERS trial, which evaluated the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy in 2763 postmenopausal women with known CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. During a four-year follow-up, 9.3 percent had ECG evidence of an MI that was unrecognized clinically in 46 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Silent myocardial ischemia and infarction'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Evidence suggests that compared with men, women face a delay in diagnosis of ACS. In a study of 10,689 patients who presented to United States emergency departments with symptoms suggestive of ACS, women who presented with evidence of myocardial infarction were more likely to be discharged home without hospitalization compared with men (3.4 versus 1.4 percent, p = 0.05) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Women below the age of 55 had a far greater risk of being discharged home with evidence of ACS compared with young men (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.4-32.5; p = 0.02). In the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction database, young women (&lt;60 years old) were more likely than young men to be given a diagnosis other than ACS at the time of admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with CHD more frequently have or develop symptomatic HF than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This appears to be due at least in part to a greater frequency of diastolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Why this might occur is not known, but it is postulated to be related to a greater prevalence of hypertensive heart disease and hypertrophy in women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for HF in women with CHD were examined in an analysis from the HERS trial of 2391 women with established coronary disease who had no HF at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At a mean of six years, 237 women (10 percent) developed HF.

The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women had a lower SCD rate than men at all ages and at any level of multivariate risk; the risk of sudden death among women with CHD was one-half that of men with CHD and accounted for a smaller proportion of coronary deaths (37 versus 56 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher fraction of sudden deaths in women occurred in the absence of prior overt CHD (63 versus 44 percent in men).

Some, but not all, of this risk can be ascribed to CHD risk factors associated with phobic anxiety such as diabetes, hypertension, and elevated serum cholesterol. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869332577\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary heart disease, also referred to as stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), is present when a patient has one or more symptoms, signs, or complications from an inadequate supply of blood to the myocardium. Many patients can be given the diagnosis based on a classic history of angina pectoris in the presence of one or more risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Established risk factors for atherosclerotic CVD'</a>.)</p><p>When first evaluated for possible SIHD, patients should receive a thorough physical examination in addition to a complete history. An electrocardiogram should be performed in all patients. However, most patients will require diagnostic testing, discussed below, either to secure the diagnosis or to evaluate the extent of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of a woman presenting with chest pain or other ischemic symptom and suspected coronary heart disease (CHD) is similar to that for men and often includes some form of noninvasive testing. However, most data suggest that women are not referred as often as men for appropriate diagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> therapeutic procedures, despite similar clinical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/32-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-38</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The specific approach depends on whether the presentation is felt to be stable or unstable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3821752263\"><span class=\"h2\">Stable patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to men, the most common presentation of stable disease is chest pain. Women who present with episodic chest pain should be evaluated for CHD. </p><p>Our approach is generally in accordance with the 2012 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease, which was not changed in the 2014 focused update [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. This guideline does not specify separate diagnostic approaches for women and men.</p><p>The first step in securing the diagnosis is to gauge the likelihood based on the character of the presenting symptoms (eg, typical versus atypical angina) and the presence or absence of coronary risk factors. The risk assessment must be sex specific because the risk factors themselves, as well as their relative importance, may differ between women and men. In particular, hormonal status, diabetes, smoking, and a family history of premature CHD appear to be more important in women. Of note, the American Heart Association guidelines for primary prevention in women suggest that using a lifetime likelihood of CHD is preferred in women, rather than a more conventional 10-year Framingham risk calculation, as the latter often underestimates risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cardiovascular risk factors in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Risk assessment tools can be used in women who present with symptoms suggestive of CHD. However, these tools, such as the Framingham Risk Estimation tool, may underestimate risk in women with a family history of early heart disease. For this reason, alternative scores, such as the Reynolds Risk Score, have been developed specifically for use in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the risk assessment process discussed above suggests that CHD is possible (intermediate risk or higher), we usually perform a stress test to secure the diagnosis. Local expertise and test availability should dictate noninvasive test selection, in part because there is a lack of clearly identifiable difference in accuracy among them. The exact choice of stress test will depend on a variety of clinical factors such as patient risk, ability to exercise, body habitus, prior test information for comparison, and non-clinical factors such as local test availability and expertise. We usually prefer stress echocardiography to stress nuclear imaging or coronary cardiac computed angiography (CCTA) due to concerns about radiation exposure, particularly to the breast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The results of the exercise test will determine whether additional testing is necessary: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the stress was adequate (maximal), the electrocardiogram (ECG) was interpretable, and the test was negative, no further evaluation is necessary. Other diagnoses should be considered.

This is in part due to a lower prevalence in women in the populations studied (Bayesian factors). The diagnostic accuracy in women is also lower due to older age at presentation with the attendant higher frequency of comorbidities and lower exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Nevertheless, exercise stress provides valuable information regarding reproducibility of symptoms, exercise capacity and longevity, and is the preferred mode of stress in women, with or without imaging. Of note, women have a lower functional capacity than men, usually achieving a maximal workload that is 2 METs less than men.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensitivity and specificity of these tests are suboptimal. In a meta-analysis that evaluated 19 studies of women who underwent exercise ECG testing (five exercise thallium imaging and three exercise echocardiography) and coronary angiography, the sensitivity and specificity for CHD with exercise ECG stress testing, exercise thallium testing, and exercise echocardiography were 61 and 70 percent, 78 and 64 percent, and 86 and 79 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These values are similar to those in men for stress echocardiography and nuclear imaging, but lower for stress ECG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>None of the stress tests is without sources of artifact. All require adequate stress for optimal accuracy, whether pharmacologic or exercise. Thus, a negative exercise test in a patient with poor exercise tolerance may be inconclusive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation exposure from CCTA and radionuclide tests has not been convincingly shown to be harmful, but it is best avoided in young women, as breast tissue is included in the radiation field.

Men, on the other hand, appear to derive similar prognostic values from both test types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540944933\"><span class=\"h2\">Unstable patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients who present with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), an ECG (to be repeated) and serial high sensitivity troponins should be obtained as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Acute coronary syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>A more complete discussion of the diagnostic approach to women and men with suspected ACS is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of patients with chest pain at low or intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal approach to the role of additional testing, such as diagnostic coronary angiography and the accurate assessment of risk in women with a non-ST elevation ACS may differ from that in men. This was suggested by an analysis from TACTICS-TIMI 18, which found that women were more likely to have elevations of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and less likely to have elevations of troponins than men, despite similar levels of risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Further, when a multimarker approach incorporating hs-CRP, BNP, and troponins was used, women with any positive marker benefited from an invasive strategy, while those with no positive markers benefited from a conservative strategy. In contrast, men benefited from an invasive strategy when there was biomarker positivity, but there was no difference in benefit according to strategy if biomarkers were negative. </p><p>The vast majority of cardiac biomarkers have similar diagnostic and prognostic value in women and men, with the exception of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Troponin levels at baseline are lower in women than in men, and sex-specific cut-offs using a high-sensitivity assay may improve detection of MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. One study demonstrated that high sensitivity troponin I assay using sex-specific diagnostic thresholds, compared with contemporary sensitive troponin I assay with a single threshold, significantly increased the diagnosis of MI in women (from 11 to 22 percent, p&lt;0.001), but had less of an effect in men (19 to 21 percent, p = 0.002) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Only women identified using the high sensitivity assay with sex-specific thresholds had the highest risk of death or recurrent MI, suggesting that these women may yield the greatest benefit from reclassification and treatment for acute MI. </p><p>Early exercise testing in women after a non-ST elevation ACS can be useful in those who have not had a coronary angiogram for establishing the presence of coronary disease and for risk stratification and prognosis. The majority of patients who have undergone coronary angiography do not need further risk assessment, although testing may be indicated once the acute phase of ACS is resolved to evaluate the possible significance of lesions in vessels other than the infarct related artery.</p><p>If testing is indicated, findings on the exercise test that independently predict future cardiac events are low maximal workload, the number of leads with &ge;0.1 mV ST segment depression, and maximal rate-pressure product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].

However, as noted above, women have a high percentage of false-positive exercise tests, which might make the test less reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This issue was addressed in a study of 395 women with unstable angina entered into the FRISC trial who were followed for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Based upon the exercise test results, low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were identified with event rates of cardiac death or MI of 1, 9, and 19 percent, respectively. The results were the same as those observed for 778 men in the trial.</p><p>A number of studies have documented gender-based differences in utilization rates of coronary angiography and revascularization, even among those with an acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/33,54-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,54-59</a>]. These differences may reflect physicians' failure to refer women with positive exercise tests for subsequent testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], leading to a poorer outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In one report, for example, women with a positive exercise test were more likely to have no further cardiac evaluation than men (62 versus 38 percent), a difference that, at three-year follow-up, was associated with a higher incidence of MI or death in women (14.3 versus 6 percent per year in men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

However, closer examination of these reports reveals an over-referral of low-risk men (based upon clinical risk stratification) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>], and a near equal rate of catheterization following MI when the procedure was performed for the treatment (not diagnosis) of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In a review of over 3000 patients (33 percent women) who underwent exercise radionuclide imaging, referral rates for men and women were comparable when stratified by the amount of abnormally perfused myocardium detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. However, among patients with an abnormal scan, the subsequent cardiac event rate was higher for women than men (17.5 versus 6.3 percent), indicating that women were under-referred for comparable degrees of risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of coronary angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for diagnostic cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography are similar for women and men.
