The subcutaneous layer lies beneath the dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54157\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54157 \">figure 1</a>). Direct infiltration of local anesthetic into the subcutaneous layer effectively blocks pain transmission from the free nerve endings located in the epidermal and dermal layers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Intradermal injection is also effective but more painful than subcutaneous injection. &#160;</p><p>Local anesthetics reversibly block sodium channels within the nerve fibers, which prevents transmission of pain signals by disrupting depolarization of the nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pain fibers are relatively unmyelinated when compared to afferent fibers that transmit the sensation of touch or temperature or nerves that control muscle contraction. Thus, infiltration of dilute solutions of local anesthetics near the nerve fibers produces relief of pain with less interruption in the sense of touch or temperature and without muscle paralysis in most children and adults. Because myelin sheaths throughout the nervous system are not fully developed in neonates and young infants, even dilute solutions of local anesthetics have a higher potential for producing muscle paralysis and central toxicity in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Local anesthetics are weak organic bases that are composed of charged and uncharged forms when in solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Only the uncharged forms are thought to be capable of diffusion through interstitial tissues and transport across the nerve membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Dispersion of the local anesthetic through the tissue occurs more rapidly as the percentage of uncharged form increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The pH of the solution and the surrounding tissues and the pKa of the specific agent determine the proportion of charged and uncharged anesthetic. Increased acidity of the solution or of the tissues (eg, infected skin) reduces the proportion of anesthetic in the uncharged form according to Henderson-Hasselbalch equation as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [Charged anesthetic] &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;(pKa-pH)<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;___________________ = 10<br/> <br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [Uncharged anesthetic]</p></div></div><p>Most local anesthetic solutions are marketed in acidic forms with pH of 5.0 to 7.0. The anesthetic is more stable in this pH range and has a shelf life of three to four years at room temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For some formulations, the pH of the anesthetic solution is increased to 7.2 to 7.4 (physiologic pH) by the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. This results in a greater proportion of anesthetic being in the uncharged form, thereby enhancing the analgesic effect and decreasing the pain of injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/3,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H540550\" class=\"local\">'Methods to decrease injection pain'</a> below.) </p><p>However, once the pH is increased, the buffered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> is more susceptible to photodegradation, aldehyde formation, and other denaturing reactions, leading to a shelf life of one to three weeks at room temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. This buffering approach cannot be used for some agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>) because they will precipitate at physiologic pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2383286244\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF LOCAL ANESTHETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most local anesthetics are classified as amides or esters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57120\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57120 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

In addition, it is prudent to use a preservative-free formulation that does not contain metabisulfites or methylparaben in patients with type IV allergic reactions to local anesthetics.

(See <a href=\"#H2694362\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of local anesthetic for infiltration depends on several factors, including duration of the procedure, need for hemostasis, patient sensitivity to catecholamines, and patient allergy to local anesthetics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56799 \">table 2</a>).
