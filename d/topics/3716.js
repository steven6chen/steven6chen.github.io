It most frequently affects infants from birth to 18 months of age, but the disease is also observed in children and adults of all ages. HLH can occur as a familial or sporadic disorder, and it can be triggered by a variety of events that disrupt immune homeostasis. Infection is a common trigger both in those with a genetic predisposition and in sporadic cases.</p><p>Prompt initiation of treatment is essential for the survival of affected patients. Often the greatest barrier to a successful outcome is a delay in diagnosis, which is difficult because of the rarity of this syndrome, the variable clinical presentation, and the lack of specificity of the clinical and laboratory findings. </p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of HLH and a related disorder, the macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), will be discussed here. The management of patients with these disorders is discussed separately.

Both primary and secondary HLH can be triggered by infections or other immunologically activating events, and gene mutations can be found in individuals of any age and with any family history. In practice, distinction between primary and secondary HLH is not essential for the initial diagnosis and management. However, identification of a gene mutation may be useful for subsequent management.

However, this term can create confusion because many patients with &quot;secondary HLH&quot; do in fact have a genetic defect associated with the syndrome (eg, heterozygous defect, mutation resulting in partial protein expression), and many patients with primary HLH experience symptoms in response to one of these triggers.

In general, the excessive inflammation is thought to be caused by a lack of normal downregulation of activated macrophages and lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The cell types involved in the pathogenesis of HLH include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Macrophages</strong> &ndash; Macrophages are professional antigen presenting cells derived from circulating monocytes; they present foreign antigens to lymphocytes. In HLH, macrophages become activated and secrete excessive amounts of cytokines, ultimately causing severe tissue damage that can lead to organ failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system#H9421079\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;, section on 'Monocytes and macrophages'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Natural killer cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes</strong> &ndash; Natural killer (NK) cells constitute 10 to 15 percent of lymphocytes. NK cells eliminate damaged, stressed, or infected host cells such as macrophages, typically in response to viral infection or malignancy, in an MHC-unrestricted manner. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system#H9421086\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;, section on 'Natural killer cells'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) are activated T lymphocytes that lyse autologous cells such as macrophages bearing foreign antigen associated with Class I histocompatibility proteins. Most CTLs express CD8. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;, section on 'T cell cytotoxicity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In HLH, NK cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CTLs fail to eliminate activated macrophages.

In a series of adult patients, those with increased CD8 numbers and decreased <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/CD8</span> ratios had the best survival. Decreased total CD3 numbers portended a bad outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H16456462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Consistent with this mechanism, most patients with HLH exhibit impaired cytotoxic function of NK cells and CTLs, coupled with excessive activation of macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. Excessive cytokine production by macrophages, NK cells, and CTLs is thought to be a primary mediator of tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H571577\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic profile'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2530808\" class=\"local\">'Cytokine storm'</a> below.)</p><p>The normal elimination of activated macrophages by NK cells and CTLs occurs through the process of perforin-dependent cytotoxicity. NK cells and CTLs lyse target cells in a series of steps that include formation of an immunologic synapse; creation of a pore in the macrophage membrane; and delivery of cytolytic granules into the macrophage. The granules contain a variety of proteases such as granzyme B that can initiate cell death, often through apoptosis. Most of the genetic defects in patients with familial HLH encode proteins involved in this process.

TLRs are non-antigen-specific receptors on the surface of NK cells that are activated by components of bacteria, fungi, viruses, or mycoplasma. Normal mice with repeated TLR9 stimulation develop an illness similar to MAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Genes associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR/interleukin</span> 1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling are upregulated in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and MAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253518\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemophagocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to antigen presentation and cytokine production, macrophages can also phagocytize host cells. Hemophagocytosis refers to the engulfment (literally &quot;eating&quot;) of host blood cells by macrophages. Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells (or fragments of these cells) within the cytoplasm of macrophages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52783\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52783 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81067\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81067 \">picture 2</a>). It can be seen on biopsies of immune tissues (lymph nodes, spleen, liver) or bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">aspirates/biopsies</span>. Although it can be a marker of excessive macrophage activation and supports the diagnosis of HLH, hemophagocytosis alone is neither pathognomonic of, nor required for, an HLH diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H10106462\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2525149\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2530808\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokine storm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The persistent activation of macrophages and NK cells and CTLs that occurs in patients with HLH leads to excessive cytokine production (cytokine storm) by all of these cells. It is thought that the excessive cytokines are ultimately responsible for multiorgan failure and the high mortality of the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/7,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18,19</a>].</p><p>Cytokines found at extremely high levels in the plasma of patients with HLH include interferon gamma (Ifn-&gamma;); tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;); interleukins (IL) such as IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12; and the soluble IL-2 receptor (CD25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Elevated IL-16 levels may be important for a TH1-type response that recruits macrophages and other cells implicated in HLH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a study of adults with secondary HLH, markedly elevated levels of IL-18 and its binding protein were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Some of these cytokines can be measured in serum and are useful in distinguishing HLH from other conditions. A study of IFN-&gamma;, IL-6, and IL-18 in patients with systemic JIA (sJIA) versus HLH showed higher levels of IFN-&gamma; and IFN-&gamma;-induced proteins in HLH compared with sJIA, but the ratio of <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-18/IFN-&gamma;</span> was higher in sJIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The initiating trigger for an acute episode is often an infection or an alteration in immune homeostasis. The two broad categories of triggers include those that cause immune activation, and those that lead to immune deficiency.</p><p>Immune activation is typically initiated by an infection. Infection is a common trigger both in those with a genetic predisposition and in sporadic cases. The most common infectious trigger for HLH is viral infection, especially with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Primary EBV infection can trigger HLH in individuals with a defect in perforin-dependent cytotoxicity as well as those without a known predisposition; patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) are at particularly high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Kawasaki disease, a common vasculitis of childhood, can also trigger HLH. Many other infectious organisms are also implicated. (See <a href=\"#H20097526\" class=\"local\">'Immunodeficiency syndromes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H549028\" class=\"local\">'Infections'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The excessive cytokine release in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) may also lead to HLH, as 3 of 17 patients with CGD at one institution developed HLH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The HLH in these patients was controlled with antimicrobials, steroids, and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG).</p><p>Common causes of immunodeficiency triggers include inherited syndromes, malignancy, rheumatologic disorders, or HIV infection. (See <a href=\"#H544353\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> below and <a href=\"#H550080\" class=\"local\">'Malignancy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23116141\" class=\"local\">'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'</a> below and <a href=\"#H549035\" class=\"local\">'Immunodeficiency'</a> below.) </p><p>The coexistence of immune dysregulation with unchecked inflammation distinguishes HLH from other syndromes of immune activation, immunodeficiencies, and inflammatory states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544353\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic defects play a major role in childhood HLH and are increasingly found in adult cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/14,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,28-32</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2530801\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>These genes act in an autosomal recessive fashion (ie, inheritance of a mutation at both alleles of a gene is required to manifest the disease); however, heterozygosity for an HLH mutation is occasionally found in an individual (typically an adult) with HLH associated with another condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H549021\" class=\"local\">'Associated illnesses'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to homozygous mutation in a single HLH gene, individuals with HLH may be compound heterozygotes (ie, they may have a different mutation in each allele of the same gene) or they may show digenic inheritance (ie, they may have separate mutations in two different genes). A review of 2701 patients referred for genetic testing revealed that 225 (8 percent) were homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations, and 28 (1 percent) showed digenic inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Another study reported similar findings, with monoallelic mutations of known familial HLH genes found in 43 of 281 patients classified as having &quot;sporadic&quot; disease, suggesting that this disorder is not a simple recessive one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>In a study that used whole exome sequencing, heterozygous variants in <em>LYST</em>, <em>MUNC13-4</em>, and <em>STXBP2</em> were discovered in 5 of 14 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who had macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), but in only 4 of 29 patients with JIA who did not have MAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Several other recessive pairs and compound heterozygotes were found. </p><p>The presence of homozygous, compound heterozygous, or digenic mutations in a patient with suspected HLH (or a heterozygous mutation in an adult) is sufficient for diagnosis. Genetic information can also be helpful in determining the likelihood of recurrence, the need for hematopoietic cell transplant, and the risk of HLH in family members.

In a review of 476 North American children, a gene mutation was identified in 45 percent of those less than one month of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In those aged between two months to one year, one to two years, and greater than two years, the frequencies of identifying a gene mutation were 39, 20, and 6 percent, respectively. </p><p>In another study of 175 adults (age range, 18 to 75 years), 14 percent had gene mutations; these tended to cause partial defects in protein function rather than complete loss of the protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This partial loss of function may explain the later age of HLH onset in some adults.

Both sepsis and HLH can have findings of disseminated intravascular coagulation and widespread inflammation with cytokine abnormalities. Unlike HLH, which is often triggered by a viral infection, sepsis is typically caused by a bacterial or fungal microorganism, and sepsis is typically not characterized by ongoing lymphocyte activation. While there is no ideal test to distinguish between sepsis and HLH, an extremely high ferritin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level were highly predictive of a subsequent diagnosis of HLH in a series of 19 children with an initial diagnosis of fever of unknown origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Those with HLH typically have more extensive organ involvement, cytopenias, extremely high ferritin, and neurologic findings. Cytokine profiles seen in HLH are not typically seen in primary liver disease.

It is possible that a subset of patients who have been diagnosed with MODS have in fact had HLH. An extremely high ferritin or dramatically increasing ferritin is more consistent with HLH than with MODS.

Unlike the anemia of HLH, the anemia in these syndromes is microangiopathic (ie, Coombs negative, characterized by schistocytes). Patients with TTP, HUS, or DITMA generally do not have rising ferritin or liver function abnormalities, although a DITMA syndrome associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> may have multiorgan failure.

It occurs when viable donor lymphocytes in the transfusion attack the recipient's tissues (skin, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract), often fatally. It is most common after hematopoietic cell transplantation but can also occur in immunocompetent individuals who have a partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match with the donor (eg, in ethnically homogenous populations or after directed donation). The typical presentation includes fever, rash, pancytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, 4 to 30 days after transfusion. High ferritin levels and hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow can also be seen. Unlike HLH, skin biopsy in ta-GVHD shows vacuolization of the basal layer and a histiocytic infiltrate, and sometimes the pathognomonic finding of satellite dyskeratosis. In cases where the two diagnoses cannot be distinguished, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, and, if not sufficient, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, can be used.

It is most common in infants and young children but can affect patients of any age, with or without a predisposing familial condition. (See <a href=\"#H2524981\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2524988\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with HLH are acutely ill with multiorgan involvement. Common findings include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, and liver function abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H543709\" class=\"local\">'Initial presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may have already experienced a prolonged hospitalization or clinical deterioration without a clear diagnosis before the possibility of HLH is raised. A priority should be placed on rapid evaluation, with the goal of starting treatment as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"#H570421\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with HLH have a predisposing genetic defect, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an immunologic trigger, which can include infection, malignancy, rheumatologic disorder such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or another disorder associated with immune dysregulation. These genetic defects and immunologic triggers should be identified in all patients. (See <a href=\"#H544353\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H549021\" class=\"local\">'Associated illnesses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation includes a complete blood count with differential, coagulation studies, serum ferritin, liver function tests, triglycerides, blood cultures, and viral testing. The bone marrow should be examined for the cause of cytopenias, infectious organisms, hemophagocytosis, and macrophage infiltration; and sent for cultures. All patients should have cerebrospinal fluid analysis and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Computed tomography scans of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis should be done to evaluate for possible malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H570421\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10106462\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with a high clinical suspicion, specialized testing of immunologic parameters and genetic testing are also indicated. HLA typing is done in preparation for possible allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H571295\" class=\"local\">'Specialized testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HLH is made by identifying a mutation in an HLH gene, or by fulfilling five of eight diagnostic criteria. Many patients fit only three or four of the eight criteria, yet have clinical evidence of HLH and require HLH-specific treatment. Modified diagnostic criteria may also be used. Hemophagocytosis, while often seen, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of HLH. (See <a href=\"#H2525149\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of HLH includes several multisystem illnesses characterized by fever, hepatic failure, and neurologic symptoms. Many of the conditions in the differential diagnosis of HLH can also cause HLH. We consider macrophage activation syndrome to be a form of HLH associated with a rheumatologic condition rather than a distinct entity. (See <a href=\"#H2525177\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23116141\" class=\"local\">'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2046407169\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Laurence A Boxer, MD, who passed away in January 2017.
