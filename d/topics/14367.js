Since that time, exponential advances in the understanding of the intersection between immune surveillance and tumor growth and development have led to broad therapeutic advances that are now being studied in all cancer types.</p><p>The basic immunology and the various approaches to immunotherapy for tumors are discussed here.

In fact, NK cells target cells with low MHC class 1 expression for destruction. Like T cells, NK cells express numerous inhibitory molecules as well, most notably various killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional cell types, such as FoxP3+ CD25+ CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) largely inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Overall, the cytotoxic activity of a CD8+ T cell is regulated by the presence and spatial orientation of a set of stimulatory and inhibitory receptors whose expression is regulated by a myriad of cytokines. Together, this configuration is often referred to as the &quot;immune synapse&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F103095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103095 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p>The T cell receptor (TCR) complex consists of two major transmembrane components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CD4 or CD8 receptor that binds to the MHC. The <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/CD8</span> protein in most T cells consists of a highly variable alpha subunit linked to a beta subunit (ab).

This interaction leads to CD3 intracellular signaling that causes secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN gamma. In the absence of a costimulatory signal, a state of peripheral tolerance to the antigen (&quot;anergy&quot;) develops (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F103339\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103339 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The most important costimulatory signal in na&iuml;ve T cells is CD28, which binds to B7-1 and B7-2 <span class=\"nowrap\">(CD80/86)</span> on the APC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F103095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103095 \">figure 1</a>). This costimulatory process is tightly regulated by both &quot;agonist&quot; molecules (eg, GITR, OX40, ICOS) and inhibitory signals on both the APC and T cells, often collectively referred to as &quot;immune checkpoint&quot; molecules. Examples of co-inhibitory or &quot;immune checkpoint&quot; molecules include cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), TIM3, and LAG3. Chronic recognition of an antigen (such as that present in a malignant clone or in a chronic viral infection) may lead to feedback inhibition of effector T cell function, resulting in a phenotype termed &quot;exhaustion&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28828748\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor evasion of immune surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevailing theory of the immune system's influence on neoplastic progression is termed &quot;cancer immunoediting,&quot; which proceeds in three phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F103342\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103342 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The elimination phase consists of innate and adaptive immune responses to specific tumor-associated antigens and is characterized by T, B, and NK cell effector function, which is mediated by cytokines such as IFN alpha, IFN gamma, and IL-12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The equilibrium phase is a balance between immune-mediated destruction by the adaptive immune system (eg, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) and persistence of rare malignant clones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunologic escape describes the phase where malignant clones have acquired the ability to evade the adaptive immune system.</p><p/><p>There are several posited mechanisms for escape from immune surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

At lower doses, IL-2 appears to preferentially expand Treg populations, probably due to the higher affinity of the trimeric IL-2 receptor (IL-2R, also known as CD25) on those cells, and inhibits the formation of Th17 cells implicated in autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although IL-2 use has been largely supplanted by the use of checkpoint inhibitors, bolus, high-dose IL-2 achieved durable objective responses in a minority of patients with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), serving as proof of principle that the immune system could eliminate cancer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Antigen choices range from simple peptides, which are easy to administer but affect a narrow antigen spectrum and are often restricted by specific HLA class 1 molecule expression that allows efficient antigen presentation, to whole cell preparations that offer a broader range of antigens but are more costly and time-consuming to prepare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>].</p><p>The only currently approved vaccine-based therapy for advanced cancer is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a>, which is an autologous dendritic-cell preparation engineered to target prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) that demonstrated an overall survival benefit in men with castrate-resistant prostate adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. Patient blood undergoes leukapheresis and is exposed ex vivo to PAP fused to GM-CSF. Theoretically, GM-CSF fosters maturation of dendritic cells and other APCs to present PAP to the patient's T cells, which then recognize the PAP. However, the degree of PAP-specific T cell proliferation at week 6 did not correlate with survival in the study, suggesting that additional immunologic mechanisms may explain this survival benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Sipuleucel-T'</a>.)</p><p>Single-peptide vaccines continue to be tested extensively, especially in &quot;immunogenic&quot; cancers such as melanoma. They have largely shown disappointing efficacy in preventing recurrence or prolonging survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. As an example, in a randomized phase III trial of 185 patients, those who received the combination of IL-2 plus the HLA-A*0201- MHC-specific vaccine against the surface glycoprotein gp100 had a higher response than those who received IL-2 alone (22 versus 10 percent), and there was a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival (17 versus 11 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. However, in the randomized clinical trial that demonstrated a survival benefit for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> with or without this gp100 vaccine, the vaccine did not improve survival over ipilimumab alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-advanced-melanoma-with-immune-checkpoint-inhibition#H262059990\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of advanced melanoma with immune checkpoint inhibition&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p>Given the increasing understanding of the importance of immune recognition of multiple patient-specific, tumor-specific antigens, current efforts to develop therapeutic vaccines against cancer are beginning to explore the use of individualized pooled antigens. This suggests that patient-specific vaccination approaches may be feasible, particularly in immunogenic tumors such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, mismatch-repair deficient colorectal carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/153,154\" class=\"abstract_t\">153,154</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H433772100\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOTHERAPY RESPONSE CRITERIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280928298\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy requires an understanding of the potentially different patterns of response seen with these classes of agents. The patterns of response to treatment with these immunotherapy agents can differ from those with molecularly targeted agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy in several important respects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may have a transient worsening of disease, manifested either by progression of known lesions or the appearance of new lesions, before the disease stabilizes or tumor regresses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F103343\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef103343 \">image 1</a>). Therefore, some caution should be taken in abandoning therapy early. However, these delayed responses are generally not observed in patients with symptomatic deterioration, so continuing therapy beyond progression is not recommended in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Responses can take longer to become apparent compared with cytotoxic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients who do not meet criteria for objective response can have prolonged periods of stable disease that are clinically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4238646952\"><span class=\"h2\">Response criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune-related response criteria (irRC) have been proposed to properly recognize the nontraditional patterns of response occasionally seen with checkpoint inhibitors and some other immunotherapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune-related complete response &ndash; Complete resolution of all measureable and nonmeasurable lesions, with no new lesions. A complete response must be confirmed by a second, consecutive assessment at least four weeks later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune-related partial response &ndash; A decrease in the total tumor burden of 50 percent or more compared with baseline, which must be confirmed by a second, consecutive assessment at least four weeks later. This category allows for the inclusion of progression of some lesions or the appearance of new lesions as long as the total tumor burden meets the response criterion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune-related stable disease &ndash; Not meeting the criteria for either a partial or complete response or for progressive disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune-related progressive disease &ndash; An increase in tumor burden of 25 percent or more relative to the minimum recorded tumor burden. This must be confirmed by a second, consecutive assessment no fewer than four weeks after the initial documentation of an increase in tumor.</p><p/><p>Use of these immune-related response criteria is important because the application of traditional Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors may lead to premature discontinuation of treatment in a patient who will eventually respond to treatment or have prolonged disease.</p><p>Consensus-based criteria for response to immunotherapy (iRECIST) have been developed for use in trials testing immunotherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115573 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. They may also be applicable to patients receiving immunotherapy in a non-trial setting.</p><p>These criteria are based upon RECIST 1.1, with some modifications, and are prefixed with an &quot;i&quot; (immune). These iRECIST criteria build upon the previously described response criteria (irRC), which were also based upon RECIST and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for response assessment in patients treated with chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. The major modifications are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitions of measurable and nonmeasurable disease; numbers and sites of target disease are the same as for RECIST 1.1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The biggest difference from RECIST 1.1 (and similar to the irRC) is that the development of new lesions during therapy is classified as immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD); immune confirmed progressive disease (iCPD) is only assigned if at the next assessment, additional new lesions appear or there is an increase in the size of the new lesions (&ge;5 mm for the sum of the new lesion targets or any increase in a new lesion nontarget); the appearance of new lesions when none have previously been recorded can also confirm iCPD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response assignment categories are immune complete response (iCR), immune partial response (iPR), iUPD, iCPD, and immune stable disease (iSD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time point responses are defined according to whether or not there was a prior iUPD in any category (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115574 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p>Immune-modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (imRECIST) have also been developed to utilize a unidimensional measurement system based upon the RECIST 1.1 system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F116649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116649 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. The imRECIST may offer advantages compared with RECIST by recognizing the potential benefits from treatment in patients who have a transient progression after initiation of immunotherapy.</p><p>In clinical practice, patients receiving any immune-based therapy and whose tumors show initial growth should be assessed carefully for signs and symptoms of clinical benefit or progression; the majority of patients will have true progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. In the absence of symptomatic progression, however, a short-term repeat scan is reasonable prior to considering immune-based therapy a failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28828938\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTORS OF RESPONSE TO IMMUNE-BASED THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As immune checkpoint blockade and other immune-based therapy approaches lead to broad treatment advances among patients with advanced cancer, an important consideration is how to best select patients whose tumors will respond to these therapies.</p><p>The candidate biomarker that has been studied most extensively is programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in trials utilizing programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade. PD-L1 and PD-1 expression are dynamic markers that change in relation to local cytokines and other factors, and the thresholds that separate &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; PD-L1 expression remain under debate. </p><p>Still, most trials with either retrospective or prospective assessments of PD-L1 status have shown trends for increased response rates to PD-1 blockade in PD-L1 &quot;positive&quot; tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/100,159-161\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,159-161</a>] (see <a href=\"#H28828779\" class=\"local\">'PD-1 and PD ligand 1/2'</a> above). Most notably, in patients with newly diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with &ge;50 percent PD-L1 expression who were randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a> or chemotherapy, those randomized to pembrolizumab had a significantly improved objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>]. On the basis of this trial, PD-L1 expression is now a routine diagnostic marker for patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC. The potential applicability of PD-L1 in other disease settings is still uncertain.</p><p>It is important that no patient with an advanced cancer and an established clinical rationale for use of an immune therapy agent should be refused immune therapy on the basis of lack of PD-L1 expression or any other investigational biomarker.</p><p>Beyond PD-L1 expression, another predictive biomarker that is being explored is somatic mutation burden. Preliminary data suggest that tumors with high rates of somatic mutations (ie, sun-exposed cutaneous melanoma, NSCLC, bladder cancer, and microsatellite-unstable colorectal carcinomas) have a higher chance of benefiting from immune checkpoint blockade than tumors with lower rates of somatic mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy/abstract/163-168\" class=\"abstract_t\">163-168</a>].</p><p>Additional gene-expression-based signatures for immune response are also under active investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28828944\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pace of discovery in the fields of immunology and cancer biology is accelerating due to the foundation laid decades ago. As our understanding of the role of the immune system in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis evolves, continued progress is likely in the treatment of malignancy.
