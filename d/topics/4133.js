This genetic abnormality results in the formation of a unique gene product (BCR-ABL1), a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that produces a continued proliferative signal resulting in the clinical manifestations of CML.</p><p>Once this mechanism was understood, efforts were aimed at developing compounds that could selectively inhibit the aberrant tyrosine kinase resulting from this molecular rearrangement. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> mesylate was the first of these to be used in the treatment of CML. Since then, several other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed and tested in patients with CML, most notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosutinib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ponatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ponatinib</a>. TKIs have become the initial treatment of choice for most patients with CML.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical use of TKIs for the treatment of CML. The mechanisms of action and resistance will be discussed along with practical information about dosing, drug interactions, and management of side effects. The treatment options for chronic myeloid leukemia at various phases of disease and monitoring of disease are discussed separately.

Ponatinib was rereleased in January 2014 with narrowed indications, further clarification of vascular risk, dose adjustment recommendations, and a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>It is not known whether the thrombotic complications are dose related and if decreasing the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ponatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ponatinib</a> will decrease the risk.
