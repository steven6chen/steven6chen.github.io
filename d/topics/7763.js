Healthy gingival tissues are pink, stippled (similar to an orange peel) and firm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54818 \">picture 1</a>). Noninflamed gingival tissue should not bleed or have suppuration during daily flossing and brushing or when professionally probed.</p><p>Gingivitis is the most common form of periodontal disease; most people have clinical signs of gingival inflammation in one or more sites of their mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Gingivitis is an inflammatory process characterized by gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding provoked by a periodontal probe, brushing, or flossing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75902\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75902 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Bacterial biofilm-induced gingivitis is a reversible condition, affecting only the gingival (gum) tissue. However, gingivitis is a precursor to periodontitis; the transition from gingivitis to periodontitis may vary from weeks to years. Periodontitis is associated with attachment loss or alveolar bone loss, and treatment for gingivitis can prevent such loss. When the bacterial biofilm is removed on a daily basis, the gingiva returns to health in approximately two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Gingivitis can be classified as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated with plaque (ie, bacterial biofilm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not plaque-induced</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modified by systemic factors (eg, hormonal changes, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modified by medications (eg, antihypertensives, immunosuppressors)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modified by malnutrition (vitamin C deficiency)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated with plaque</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental plaque-induced gingival disease is the most common form of gingivitis. Dental plaque, also known as bacterial biofilm, is a dense, non-mineralized, complex mass of bacterial colonies living in a gel-like intermicrobial matrix that forms around the gingival margin (gum line), both supra- and subgingivally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].</p><p>Plaque (also referred to as dental plaque biofilm) begins to accumulate within 24 hours without regular removal. The amount of tissue damage related to plaque is dependent on the interaction between the plaque and the host defense mechanisms.</p><p>The biofilm has an exopolysaccharide that surrounds and protects it from <span class=\"nowrap\">antibiotic/drug</span> penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Mechanical debridement (regular toothbrushing, dental flossing, supplemented by instrumentation by a dental professional) is the only effective way to remove dental biofilms. The goal of daily hygiene is to reduce both supra and subgingival bacteria below a threshold level capable of initiating <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perpetuating clinical inflammation.</p><p>Plaque buildup may be promoted by dental restorations that are ill-fitting, have overhanging margins, or open margins. Such conditions increase inflammation and may lead to loss of both clinical attachment and alveolar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Calculus (&quot;tartar&quot;) is essentially mineralized plaque. Calculus promotes the retention of bacterial biofilm and must be removed to promote resolution of inflammation. Calculus cannot be removed by toothbrushing, flossing, or polishing and requires intervention by a dentist or dental hygienist for scaling and root planing procedures, using hand or ultrasonic instrumentation.</p><p>Personal plaque control involves improved home care to reduce bacterial load via brushing (manual or power brush) twice daily, flossing once daily, and rinsing with an <span class=\"nowrap\">antimicrobial/antiseptic</span> mouthrinse or dentifrice (eg toothpaste, powder, or gel) twice daily. A 2011 meta-analysis of randomized trials found that flossing, in addition to toothbrushing, reduced gingivitis compared with toothbrushing alone at one-, three-, and six-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A 2014 meta-analysis of 56 randomized trials comparing powered toothbrushes with manual brushing found that the use of powered toothbrushes decreased plaque and gingivitis at both one and three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>A 2017 systematic review examined the effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> mouthrinse as an adjunctive treatment to usual toothbrushing and cleaning for the control of gingivitis and plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. 51 randomized controlled trials involving 5345 participants found that use of the mouthrinse for 4-6 weeks reduced gingivitis by 21% (95% CI 0.11-0.31) compared to placebo, control, or no mouthrinse, but the effect was not considered clinically important. Plaque development was also reduced by 45% (95% CI 1.00-1.90) in participants who used the mouthrinse. However, an increase in tooth staining, which may require scaling and polishing, was observed in participants who used the mouthrinse for 4 weeks or longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonplaque-induced</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental plaque does not have an etiologic role in all gingivitis. Non-plaque-induced gingivitis represents a small percentage of gingivitis cases and diagnosis may be difficult. The gingival inflammation may be due to one or more of several factors: infectious (specific bacteria, viruses or fungi); dermatologic; allergic; genetic; trauma-related; or a manifestation of systemic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Modified by systemic factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancy gingivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal shifts during pregnancy may cause the gingiva to become inflamed and overgrown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82278\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82278 \">picture 3</a>). Gingival inflammation tends to increase during pregnancy and diminishes postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Pregnancy-related gingivitis may be unrelated to the amount of plaque biofilm and usually does not increase rates of bone or attachment loss (periodontitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Patients should be instructed to perform meticulous oral hygiene procedures to keep the plaque biofilm levels to a minimum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Therapy for pregnancy gingivitis may consist of debridement and adjunctive antibiotics. In one randomized trial of 800 pregnant women with gingivitis, there were no differences in pregnancy outcomes between women who received periodontal treatment during gestational weeks 13 to 17 and those who were treated postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Dental professionals commonly schedule periodontal treatments for the early part of the second trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and defer additional treatment of nonurgent periodontal needs until the postpartum period, although there is no evidence to support this practice. Acute infection, abscess, or potential sources of sepsis need prompt intervention, regardless of the pregnancy stage.</p><p>Another condition, pregnancy-associated pyogenic granuloma (pregnancy tumor), occurs in approximately 0.5 to 5 percent of pregnant women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66965\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66965 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This is an exaggerated inflammatory response to local irritants (plaque and calculus) that occur during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pyogenic granuloma is painless and usually occurs in the anterior mandibular or maxillary gingiva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Plaque and calculus should be removed, but the pregnancy granuloma should not be excised during pregnancy, as it may resolve after parturition; excision is necessary if it does not resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Hormonal changes outside of pregnancy may also influence gingival health. Some women experience an increase in gingival inflammation with ovulation (menstrual cycle-associated gingivitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The soft tissues are painful and bleed easily, and there may be rapid periodontal destruction. The microbiologic pattern is dominated by Gram-negative anaerobes, enteric strains, and yeast (<em>Candida albicans</em>); these organisms are not found in routine cases of gingivitis.

The gingiva affected by these drugs can have hyperplasia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertrophy. The preferred clinical diagnostic terminologies are either &quot;drug-induced gingival overgrowth&quot; or &quot;drug-induced gingival enlargement.&quot;</p><p>The clinical manifestations of gingival overgrowth are the same, regardless of which drug caused the reaction. The gingival tissues can grow disproportionally by several millimeters, covering one-third or more of the teeth crowns. The overgrown tissues form pseudo-gum pockets that easily harbor and protect the bacterial biofilm. Consequently, there are significant inflammatory changes leading to gingival bleeding and discomfort when eating and <span class=\"nowrap\">brushing/flossing,</span> perpetuating the problem.</p><p>The severity and distribution of the overgrowth is dose- and case-specific. The overgrown tissues may create deep pockets that interfere with appropriate oral hygiene. In addition, gingival overgrowth can become a significant aesthetic and functional (chewing) problem for the affected patient.</p><p>Gingival overgrowth (hyperplasia and hypertrophy) may be due to a direct effect of the drug. One case report has demonstrated that regression of cyclosporine-induced gingival overgrowth is possible upon interruption of drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, it is generally accepted that the inflammatory changes caused by the bacteria biofilm synergize with the drug effect to cause overgrowth of the soft tissues.</p><p>Treatment of gingival overgrowth includes conscientious mechanical and chemical plaque (bacterial biofilm) control (ie, brushing, flossing, and use of dentifrices and rinses with antimicrobial properties). Even with conscientious oral toilet, surgical removal of the overgrown tissue is frequently inevitable. Gingivectomy (excision of excessive gingival tissue) is indicated for severe cases that affect oral hygiene, function (chewing), or cosmetic (esthetic) issues. Gingivectomy can be performed by scalpel, electrosurgery, high-speed dental handpiece with a diamond burr, or laser therapy. Successful outcome depends on restoration of normal gingival contours and careful postoperative care.</p><p>Long term, when possible, the drug responsible for gingival overgrowth should be discontinued and another substituted. Recurrence of overgrown gingival tissues is likely if the medication cannot be changed.

Pain is the hallmark of necrotizing periodontal diseases. The sloughed material, or film, consists of fibrin, necrotic tissue, leukocytes, erythrocytes, and bacteria. Removal of this film causes bleeding and exposure of ulcerated and erythematous tissue.</p><p>It is unclear if ANUG is an entity distinct from necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP). For this reason, these conditions have been designated as a single category and renamed &quot;necrotizing periodontal disease&quot; (NPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The patient may be febrile with lymphadenopathy.

If no systemic involvement is present, patients may be managed in a dental or periodontal office with thorough debridement (scaling and root planing) under local anesthesia. Adjunctive antibiotics and antimicrobial rinses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate mouthrinse) are often indicated in addition to intraoral debridement.

Bone loss is seen on radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62167\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62167 \">picture 8</a>). Progression of the disease will cause increased mobility and eventual tooth loss.

It is plaque-induced and a major cause of tooth loss throughout the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The disease usually occurs as a slowly progressive condition, with unpredictable brief episodic periods of rapid progression and attachment loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/43-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-49</a>]. The triggering mechanism for active bone loss has not been clearly elucidated but appears to be associated with a shift from a predominantly Gram-positive flora to a predominance of anaerobic Gram-negative rods. It has been hypothesized that supragingival plaque serves as a reservoir for the pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. When the host is overwhelmed, the pathogenic supragingival bacteria migrate subgingivally and form a subgingival biofilm that can be highly detrimental to surrounding periodontal structures.</p><p>Host response to the pathogenic flora is variable.

Disease activity and tissue destruction are modulated through production of inflammatory factors, including interleukins, prostaglandins, and matrix metalloproteinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>Chronic (common) periodontitis is graded by increasing severity ranging from slight to severe involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50857\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50857 \">table 1</a>).

Both conditions affect otherwise healthy patients, although abnormalities in phagocyte function can be identified. Rapid loss of attachment and bone destruction occur, but the condition may be self-arresting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Severity of disease is not related to the amount of bacterial biofilm present, and there is a strong genetic predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Localized aggressive periodontitis usually affects prepubescent individuals, predominantly African-American females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Bone loss around the first permanent molars, mandibular, and maxillary central incisors is seen on radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52689\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52689 \">picture 9</a>). The bone loss may be rapid and severe with few overt clinical signs of inflammation. Untreated lesions will develop into adult periodontitis.

Bacterial biofilm is also an important etiologic factor in this category. However, periodontal condition is considered a manifestation of the systemic disease because the underlying host impairment is a major determinant in the development and severity of the periodontitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Periodontal disease in patients with diabetes mellitus is not described as a distinct disease entity, but the prevalence and overall severity of periodontal disease is increased, particularly when diabetes is not well controlled.

The etiology may include severe chronic periodontitis, genetic predisposition (ie, larger teeth in smaller dental arches) and heavy toothbrushing. Gum (soft tissue) grafting surgery is primarily performed for gingival recession in the context of dentin hypersensitivity to cold and sweets, root caries, discomfort when <span class=\"nowrap\">chewing/brushing,</span> or cosmetics. Soft tissue grafting is also indicated to correct gingival recession that interferes with good oral hygiene (flossing and brushing). Patients with thin alveolar bone and gum tissue may benefit from soft tissue grafting prior to orthodontic therapy, to prevent gum recession.
