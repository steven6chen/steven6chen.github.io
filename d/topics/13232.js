As an example, a survey of more than 78,000 parents in the United States in 2007 found that among their children, the point prevalence of depression for different age groups was as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3 to 5 years &ndash; 0.5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>6 to 11 years &ndash; 1.4 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>12 to 17 years &ndash; 3.5 percent </p><p/><p>The one year and lifetime prevalence rates of depression are even higher. A survey of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years in the United States (n &gt;45,000) in 2010 and 2011 found that the one year prevalence of major depression was 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Another study found that the lifetime prevalence in adolescents was 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122228\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ratio of adolescent females to males who develop major depression is approximately two to one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], which is similar to the ratio in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This sex difference emerges during puberty; in adolescence, the risk for developing depression is greater in girls than boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the United States, a study of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (n &gt;45,000) found that the lifetime prevalence rates of major depression in females and in males were 18 and 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, in prepubertal children, depression appears to be more common in boys than girls.

Patients may manifest a depressed mood by perceiving others as antagonistic or uncaring, brooding about real or potentially unpleasant circumstances, maintaining a gloomy or hopeless outlook, believing that everything is &quot;unfair&quot;, or feeling helpless or that they disappoint others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, pediatric patients may lack the emotional and cognitive ability to correctly identify and organize their emotional experiences, and depressive disorders may express themselves with an irritable mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Irritability can manifest as feeling &quot;annoyed,&quot; &ldquo;grouchy,&rdquo; or &quot;bothered&quot; by everything and everyone. Rather than expressing sadness, patients with depressive disorders may be negative and argumentative, and pick fights as a means to convey their emotional distress. Patients may be unable to tolerate frustration and respond to minor provocations with angry outbursts. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Depressed mood appears to be more common than irritable mood in pediatric depression. A prospective study of children and adolescents with depressive disorders (n &gt;1400) found that depressed mood occurred in approximately 58 percent, depressed mood plus irritable mood in 36 percent, and irritable mood in only 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although irritability is a nonspecific symptom found in many child psychiatric disorders, longitudinal follow-up studies indicate that irritability is associated with adult depressive disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mood reactivity (the capacity to be cheered up in response to positive events) occurs in depression with atypical features (eg, hyperphagia or hypersomnia), which may be more common in children. By contrast, depression with melancholic features may be more common in adolescents. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Depressive episode specifiers'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mood reactivity can cause adolescents to seek activities and experiences to temporarily lift their moods. Examples of these activities include affiliation with peers, thrill-seeking, promiscuity, and drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The use of peer affiliation to alleviate depression is marked by an intense urgency and drive, in contrast to the normal adolescent need for peer affiliation. Depressed adolescents, particularly girls, may often co-ruminate with another depressed peer, thereby reinforcing and increasing depressive severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diminished interest or pleasure</strong> &ndash; Loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia) in formerly pleasurable activities is also a cardinal symptom of unipolar major depression. Patients experience events, hobbies, interests, and people as less interesting or fun than previously. Anhedonia may be expressed by describing experiences as &quot;boring,&quot; &quot;stupid,&quot; or &quot;uninteresting.&quot; They may withdraw from or lose interest in friends. If they are sexually active, they may have decreased libido or interest in sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Change in appetite or weight</strong> &ndash; Appetite and weight may decrease or increase in depression. Decreased appetite may manifest with failure to gain weight as expected, rather than weight loss. Alternatively, some patients with depressive disorders crave and eat more specific foods (eg, junk food and carbohydrates) and gain more weight than expected during their adolescent growth spurt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preoccupation with weight and body image are signs of anorexia nervosa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9751760\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Anorexia nervosa'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep disturbance</strong> &ndash; Sleep disturbance manifests as insomnia, hypersomnia, or significant shifts of sleep pattern over the diurnal cycle:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial insomnia (difficulty getting to sleep)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Middle insomnia (waking in the middle of the night, with difficulty returning to sleep)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Terminal insomnia (waking too early and being unable to return to sleep)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypersomnia (extended nighttime sleep or daytime sleeping) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Circadian reversal (daytime sleeping and nighttime arousal)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many depressed patients describe their sleep as nonrestorative and report difficulty getting out of bed in the morning. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychomotor agitation or retardation</strong> &ndash; Psychomotor agitation refers to handwringing; the inability to sit still; pacing; or pulling or rubbing clothes, the skin, or other objects. Alternatively, depressed patients with psychomotor retardation talk or move more slowly than is typical for them; in addition, speech volume or inflection may be decreased, and the amount of speech may be diminished. Psychomotor agitation or retardation is regarded as a depressive symptom only if it is noticeable to others, in contrast to subjective feelings of restlessness or feeling slowed down. Retardation and agitation may alternate within a single depressive episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fatigue or loss of energy</strong> &ndash; Lack of energy (anergia) manifests with feeling tired, exhausted, listless, and unmotivated. Patients may feel the need to rest during the day, experience heaviness in their limbs, or feel like it is hard to initiate activities. Parent-adolescent conflicts can result if parents attribute lack of energy and motivation to laziness, an oppositional attitude, or avoidance of responsibilities. Alternatively, parents may be concerned that the patient has a general medical illness and seek a medical explanation for the anergia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt</strong> &mdash; The self-perceptions of depressed children and adolescents may be marked by feelings of inadequacy, inferiority, failure, worthlessness, and guilt. Evaluation of this symptom is challenging because many youth do not directly acknowledge such negative self-perceptions. In addition, guilt about struggling with depression and its associated functional impairment is not considered a symptom of depression unless the guilt is of delusional proportions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Feelings of worthlessness or guilt may manifest as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Excessively self-critical assessment of accomplishments</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Difficulty identifying positive self-attributes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Strong dissatisfaction with several aspects of themselves</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Compulsive lying about success or skills to bolster self-esteem</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Envy or preoccupation with the success of others, especially in comparison with self-evaluation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marked self reproach or guilt for events that are not their fault</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Belief that they deserve to be punished for things that are not their fault</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reluctance to try to do things because patients fear they will fail, and decide &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impaired concentration and decision making </strong>&ndash; Depressed youth can have problems with attention, concentration, and memory that were not present to the same degree before the depressive episode. Thinking and processing of information may be slowed. In addition, patients are indecisive, which manifests as procrastination, helplessness, or paralysis in taking action. It can take longer to complete homework and class work than before the depressive episode; school performance may thus decline. Information from the school is helpful to evaluate this symptom.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recurring thoughts of death or suicide</strong> &ndash; Depressed patients can experience recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of death) or suicide, or attempt suicide. Morbid thoughts are common in depressed teens and can manifest as preoccupation with music and literature that has morbid themes, or as passive suicidal ideation (eg, thoughts that life is not worth living or that others would be better off if the patient was dead). In addition, there may be active suicidal ideation of wanting to die or killing oneself, suicide plans, suicide pacts, and suicide attempts. Thoughts that contribute to suicidality include pervasive hopelessness (eg, negative expectations for the future) and a view of suicide as the only option to escape emotional pain. Risk factors, assessment, and management of suicidal behavior in children and adolescents is discussed separately.

In addition, depressed adolescents are at increased risk for engaging in health risk behaviors such as promiscuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

A nationally representative survey of adolescents in the United States found that among the individuals with major depression, at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder was present in more than 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; this is consistent with a review that found comorbidity was present in 40 to 90 percent of depressed children and adolescents, and two or more comorbid diagnoses were found in up to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In addition, depressed patients are more likely to manifest health problems or somatic concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>Depression in children and adolescents usually emerges after the comorbid disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Anxiety disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are particularly strong predictors of eventual depression. Although substance abuse is more likely to precede depression than follow it, substance abuse can also emerge as a complication of depression.</p><p>Comorbidity adversely affects outcomes in depressed patients, and is associated with a longer duration of illness, poorer response to treatment, and increased recurrence of depressive episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

Several traditional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and tobacco smoking) are more prevalent among adolescents with major depression compared with the general pediatric population. Based upon available data, the American Heart Association proposed in a 2015 statement that major depression be positioned alongside other pediatric diseases (chronic inflammatory disease, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, Kawasaki disease, and nephrotic syndrome) that are considered moderate risk conditions for early cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].
