The kidneys are organs in the urinary tract that make urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). Each kidney has 2 parts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A part that filters the blood and removes waste and excess salt and water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A part that collects the urine</p><p/><p>In hydronephrosis, the part of the kidney that collects the urine gets too much urine in it. This makes it swell and get bigger than normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26485896\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes hydronephrosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydronephrosis happens when the urinary tract gets blocked. Then the urine can't drain, and it backs up into the kidney. Different conditions can cause a blockage in the urinary tract.</p><p>In adults, the most common causes of a blockage are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or &quot;BPH&quot; &ndash; This is the medical term for an enlarged prostate. The prostate is an organ (in men) that surrounds the urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65675 \">figure 2</a>). The urethra is the tube the urine goes through before leaving the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer of the prostate or cancer of other organs in the lower belly &ndash; Cancer growths can push on the urinary tract to block the flow of urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Stones&quot; in the urinary tract &ndash; Small &quot;stones&quot; can form from the salts and minerals that are normally in the urine. These stones can block the urinary tract.</p><p/><p>Blockages can happen suddenly or slowly over time. They can affect one or both kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26485910\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hydronephrosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with hydronephrosis have no symptoms, especially if the blockage happened slowly over time. They might find out they have hydronephrosis when their doctor does a test for another reason.</p><p>When people do have symptoms, they usually include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain &ndash; People can have pain in their lower belly, genital area, sides, or lower back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in urination &ndash; Hydronephrosis usually makes people urinate less than usual. But this doesn't always happen.</p><p/><p>People can have other symptoms, too, depending on what's causing the blockage. For example, if the hydronephrosis is caused by BPH, symptoms might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needing to urinate often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having trouble starting to urinate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a weak urine stream, or leaking or dribbling urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling as though the bladder is not empty after urinating</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26485925\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have the symptoms listed above, call your doctor or nurse. If you are not able to make any urine at all, call him or her right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26485940\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will also do tests to check for the cause of your hydronephrosis and see how serious your condition is. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different types of imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26485955\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hydronephrosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might not need any treatment if you have no symptoms, your blood test results are normal, and your kidneys are working normally.</p><p>If you do need treatment, it will depend on your individual situation.</p><p>To help urine drain out of your urinary tract, your doctor might put tubes in different parts of your urinary tract.</p><p>If your blockage has caused an infection in your urinary tract, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.</p><p>Your doctor will also remove the blockage in your urinary tract. How your doctor does this will depend on what's causing the blockage. For example, BPH that causes hydronephrosis is usually treated with surgery to remove some of the prostate or shrink the prostate.</p><p>If cancer is causing your hydronephrosis, your doctor will talk with you about your treatment options. Cancer can be treated in different ways, depending on the type of cancer.</p><p>Stones in the urinary tract can be treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A machine that uses sound waves to break up the stones</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the stones</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;ureteroscopy&quot; in which a doctor puts a thin tube into the urethra. The tube has special tools on the end that the doctor can use to break up or remove the stones.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26486010\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-enlarged-prostate-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prostate cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-bph-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-treatment-stage-i-to-iii-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Prostate cancer treatment; stage I to III cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-advanced-prostate-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Treatment for advanced prostate cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
