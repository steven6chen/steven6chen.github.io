The Fontan operation originally was described for patients with tricuspid atresia in 1971 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the past 40 years, the types of malformations for which the Fontan operation is utilized has expanded considerably, and it has become the most common operation performed for patients with any type of single ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Following the Fontan procedure, patients face substantial morbidity and mortality risk and require lifelong follow-up with a cardiologist experienced in the care of patients with complex congenital heart disease (pediatric cardiologist or adult congenital heart disease specialist). </p><p>This topic will discuss management of patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure.

Depending on the underlying anatomy, this chamber could be either a left or right ventricle. This functionally single ventricle must supply blood to the higher resistance, systemic circulation, as well as provide blood flow to the pulmonary circulation (which typically has lower resistance) in order to support long-term survival. This balance of the circulations occurs spontaneously only rarely, and surgical modification of the circulation is usually required. As a result, there is no systolic pump for the systemic venous blood to get to the lungs. </p><p>The Fontan procedure, in its varied forms, effectively diverts systemic venous return to the lungs without a pump. Pulmonary blood flow is driven by central venous pressure and is augmented by changes in intrathoracic pressure; active relaxation of the systemic ventricle (drawing blood forward) as well the peripheral skeletal muscle pump contribute to pulmonary blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For this circulation to be effective, the patient must have a low pulmonary arteriolar resistance, relatively normal systolic and diastolic function of the single ventricle, and sufficiently large pulmonary arteries to avoid any mechanical resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108726893\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITERIA FOR FONTAN PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accepted criteria for the Fontan procedure are similar to the original requirements Fontan and colleagues considered necessary for an &quot;ideal&quot; Fontan candidate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], though some criteria such as age and pulmonary artery anatomy requirements are frequently modified in current practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Common criteria for the Fontan procedure include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age. The Fontan operation is currently typically performed between two and five years of age, with a weight of around 10 to 15 kg, depending on the specific clinical presentation, surgical history, and center preference. While some centers perform the Fontan between two and three years of age in an attempt to limit the amount of time the patient is cyanosed, others wait until there is physiologic need (decreasing oxygen saturations, symptoms), often between three and five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although the Fontan operation in early childhood is preferred, the Fontan operation is an option in carefully selected adults with functional single ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The current flexibility in age criteria contrasts with the original commandments, which specified ages 4 to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus rhythm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal drainage of the venae cavae. While normal drainage of the venae cavae was one of the original commandments, modifications of the Fontan have been published for use in patients with an interrupted inferior vena cava. The most popular of these is the Kawashima procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal right atrial volume</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low pulmonary artery pressure (&lt;15 mmHg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low pulmonary resistance (&lt;4 Woods <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate pulmonary artery size (PA to aorta ratio &gt;0.75)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal ventricular function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">No/minimal</span> atrioventricular valve regurgitation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal pulmonary artery anatomy without distortion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108726786\"><span class=\"h1\">FONTAN &quot;PHYSIOLOGY&quot;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following Fontan procedure, since there is no ventricular pump to propel blood into the pulmonary arterial circulation, systemic venous pressures remain elevated compared with those of a normal biventricular circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95254 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Many of the common problems seen post-Fontan are directly or indirectly related to this chronic elevation of central venous pressure.</p><p>Cardiac output is also typically lowered compared with pre-Fontan.</p><p>Of note, after the Fontan procedure (particularly using an extracardiac conduit), the coronary sinus is typically left draining to the systemic circulation. As such, a post-Fontan baseline oxygen saturation of 100 percent is rare, since deoxygenated coronary sinus blood enters into the systemic circulation. (See <a href=\"#H13723584\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13723564\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON SURGERIES PRIOR TO THE FONTAN PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When evaluating a patient who has had a Fontan procedure, taking a detailed surgical history is critically important, including a review of all past operative notes, as this enhances insight into the specific physiology of the individual Fontan patient. While some patients may not require surgeries prior to a Fontan, the vast majority of patients (particularly for those having the Fontan procedure since 1990) will have had at least one prior palliative procedure. The following are surgeries that patients may have received prior to the Fontan procedure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (bidirectional Glenn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95319\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95319 \">figure 2</a>)).

This includes staged reconstruction to allow unobstructed flow from the systemic right ventricle to aortic arch and coronary arteries; thus, the stages include aortic arch repair, relief of obstruction to pulmonary venous return (if present), and shunt placement from either right ventricle to pulmonary artery or a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome#H1474255318\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Stage I'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure (performed for hypoplastic left heart syndrome or other forms of single ventricle physiology with systemic outflow obstruction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starnes procedure (performed for severe Ebstein&rsquo;s anomaly; the procedure includes patch closure of the tricuspid valve annulus, atrial septectomy, and placement of a systemic-pulmonary shunt).

The un-fenestrated Fontan returns the patient to near normal oxygen saturations by fully separating the pulmonary and systemic circulations, and aims to return the systemic ventricle to a near-normal workload. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13723576\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13723584\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common forms of the Fontan procedures are demonstrated in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95320 \">figure 5</a>).<strong> </strong>The two most prevalent forms seen in pediatric and adult cardiology clinics are the atriopulmonary (or &quot;classic&quot;) connection and the cavopulmonary connection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95320 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the atriopulmonary Fontan, the right atrial appendage is directly anastomosed to the main pulmonary artery, providing a pathway for blood from the inferior and superior venae cavae to get to the pulmonary circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95320 \">figure 5</a>). The atrial septum is left intact (or repaired), and there should be no shunting between the right atrium (deoxygenated blood) and the left atrium (oxygenated blood). In some of the very first versions of the Fontan operation, artificial valves were placed in the circuit; however, this was quickly abandoned due to high compliance, associated dilation of the right atrium, and calcific obstruction of the valves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cavopulmonary connection was first described by de Leval in 1988 and uses either an intra-atrial conduit, lateral tunnel (incorporating part of the native right atrium in the pathway), or extracardiac conduit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95320 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]; the last was first described by Marcelletti [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This completes the &quot;total cavopulmonary connection&quot; and can be done as the initial operation or after a bidirectional Glenn anastomosis.</p><p/><p>Since the year 2000, the majority of patients undergoing a Fontan procedure have an extracardiac conduit placed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95320 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]; the surgical procedure, and material used for the conduit, varies among institutions. These extracardiac conduits typically vary in size from 18 to 22 mm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13723590\"><span class=\"h2\">Fenestration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In selected cases, a fenestration in the Fontan is either left or created, functioning as a small residual atrial septal defect. This allows a small right-to-left shunt to persist between the Fontan connection and the left atrium. Given the potential benefits and risks of fenestration, some centers have moved towards using fenestration only in &quot;high-risk&quot; patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. This commonly includes patients with mildly elevated pulmonary pressure or vascular resistance, those with abnormal pulmonary artery anatomy, and patients with other risks for protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). The decision remains largely center-specific. Management of patients with PLE is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H13723709\" class=\"local\">'Protein-losing enteropathy'</a> below.)</p><p>A fenestration eases the transition to the Fontan circulation for patients by providing a consistent source of systemic ventricular preload. Secondary benefits of fenestration include reported decreased duration of postoperative pleural effusions and diminished postoperative hospital length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>Potential risks include paradoxical embolization (thus anticoagulation is suggested for Fontan patients with fenestration), desaturation from right-to-left shunting, and the potential need for future percutaneous procedures to close the fenestration. </p><p>Spontaneous fenestration closure occurs frequently. If the patient has acceptable post-Fontan hemodynamics, spontaneous fenestration closure may not result in any sequelae and may be found during routine follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13723596\"><span class=\"h2\">Conversion surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In selected patients with a history of atriopulmonary Fontan, surgical conversion to an extracardiac conduit (or intracardiac lateral tunnel or intra-atrial conduit) may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/1,8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,20</a>]. In patients who present with symptomatic arrhythmias,<strong> </strong>Fontan conversion in conjunction with arrhythmia surgery (Maze procedure) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>) has been shown to reduce the arrhythmia burden and improve exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Systemic anticoagulation is recommended for all Fontan patients with atrial arrhythmias. Due to absence of data on direct oral anticoagulants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is currently the preferred therapy.</p><p>Sustained arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic compromise is a medical emergency; electrical cardioversion is the treatment of choice and is usually effective. Transesophageal echocardiography is generally recommended for all Fontan patients undergoing elective cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias, even when on anticoagulation, due to a high risk of atrial thrombus. The most common sites for thrombus are right atrium, Fontan conduit, left atrial appendage, and pulmonary vein orifices.</p><p>Patients with infrequent (&lt;once per year), promptly recognized, and well-tolerated intra-atrial tachycardia may be treated with a chronic atrioventricular node blocking agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, beta blocker, or calcium channel blocker) to limit the rate of ventricular response, anticoagulation, and periodic cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In this model, the primary insult is the chronic low cardiac output that occurs in many patients after the Fontan operation, resulting in poor perfusion of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Mesenteric vascular impedance is markedly increased in patients with PLE, which in combination with vascular congestion due to elevated venous pressures, results in abnormal enterocyte function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

Random &quot;single sample&quot; analysis of stool for alpha-1-antitrypsin level is not as accurate as the formal 24-hour clearance study.

Hepatic fibrosis was first reported in the 1980s in patients with a history of Fontan operation, with reports of progression to high-grade cirrhosis. The degree of cirrhosis can be heterogeneous within the liver. Most concerning is the report of patients being diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, all of whom had cardiac cirrhosis due to Fontan operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. </p><p>A retrospective study evaluated 195 patients who had liver imaging or liver biopsy after Fontan operation. Of these, <span class=\"nowrap\">40/195</span> (21 percent) had a diagnosis of cirrhosis. The mean duration from Fontan operation to a diagnosis of cirrhosis was 23&plusmn;6 years. The freedom from cirrhosis in this cohort was 99, 94, and 57 percent at 10, 20, and 30 years, respectively. However, these data should be interpreted cautiously, as this is a retrospective cohort with a high degree of selection bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>After a patient has a Fontan, the liver is subjected to a chronic low-cardiac output state combined with increased mesenteric resistance and chronic venous congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/81,84,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,84,98</a>].<strong> </strong>As a substantial amount of blood flow to the liver is dependent on the mesenteric circulation, the elevated central venous pressure and mesenteric resistance seen in Fontan patients may result in further abnormalities of blood supply to the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. </p><p>Patients post-Fontan with liver disease are most often asymptomatic, with abnormalities found on screening blood work such as elevated liver enzymes or radiologic abnormalities on liver ultrasound, MRI, or CT.</p><p>The most effective method of surveillance for liver disease in Fontan patients is uncertain. We suggest routine liver imaging (MRI or CT) every three to five years in patients who are five or more years out from their Fontan operation. Patients with features of cirrhosis require close monitoring, including twice annual laboratory surveillance (alpha-fetoprotein level) and annual imaging due to a higher risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Routine laboratory markers such as liver enzymes are rarely helpful for screening this cohort of patients since blood tests do not adequately distinguish patients with normal, noncirrhotic changes and cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]. </p><p>Routine liver biopsy has been proposed for all patients 10 years after Fontan operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. However, the sensitivity of liver biopsy in these patients with heterogeneous liver findings is unclear, as is the availability of treatment modifications based on results. In the event of abnormal findings on ultrasound, MRI, or CT, however, biopsy remains the gold standard to investigate a specific lesion. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) or ultrasound-based elastography of the liver appear promising for the noninvasive screening of patients after Fontan for liver pathology; however, further research is required before these become the standard screening tools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].</p><p>Consultation with a hepatologist who has experience in hepato-cardiac cirrhosis and patients with Fontan operation is recommended for those with evidence of liver disease. Non-cardiac causes of cirrhosis (hepatitis, inherited or autoimmune disorders) should be excluded. MRE or ultrasound-based elastography or liver biopsy should be considered to confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis and assess severity. Patients with cirrhosis should be referred for upper endoscopy to identify esophageal varices. Prognostic stratification can be performed by assessing patients for features of portal hypertension using modifications of current criteria such as MELD-XI score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>].

A review of patient medications should be performed, including discussion of need and options for anticoagulation and discontinuation of medications that are harmful during pregnancy such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

(See <a href=\"#H108726621\" class=\"local\">'Lesions treated by the Fontan procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Fontan procedure was developed to divert systemic venous return to the lungs in patients with an effective single ventricle. For this circulation to be effective, the patients must have a low pulmonary arteriolar resistance, relatively normal systolic and diastolic function of the single ventricle, and sufficiently large pulmonary arteries to avoid any component of mechanical resistance. (See <a href=\"#H108726512\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for the Fontan procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H108726893\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for Fontan procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following Fontan procedure, systemic venous pressures are elevated compared with those with a normal biventricular circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95254 \">figure 1</a>), which leads to many of the common problems seen post-Fontan. (See <a href=\"#H108726786\" class=\"local\">'Fontan &quot;physiology&quot;'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common forms of Fontan procedure are the atriopulmonary connection and the cavopulmonary connection. A cavopulmonary connection with an extracardiac conduit has been the dominant Fontan procedure since the year 2000. (See <a href=\"#H13723584\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversion from atriopulmonary Fontan to an extracardiac conduit is considered in selected patients with symptomatic refractory arrhythmias, Fontan pathway obstruction, exercise intolerance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> refractory cyanosis. (See <a href=\"#H13723596\" class=\"local\">'Conversion surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival rates 15 to 20 years after Fontan procedure range from 60 to 85 percent. (See <a href=\"#H13723608\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis after Fontan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with prior Fontan operation require lifelong follow-up with a cardiologist experienced in the care of patients with complex congenital heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H13723620\" class=\"local\">'Long-term follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common issues and complications post-Fontan include arrhythmias, cyanosis, functional and developmental disorders, ventricular dysfunction, atrioventricular valve regurgitation, kidney disease, venovenous fistulae, thromboembolic events, protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), liver disease, lung disease, and venous insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H13723654\" class=\"local\">'Common issues post-Fontan and their management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of thromboembolic risk in Fontan patients includes anticoagulation, maintenance of sinus rhythm, and <span class=\"nowrap\">recognition/treatment</span> of Fontan obstruction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulation is recommended for all Fontan patients with history of thromboembolism, atrial thrombus, right atrial blood stasis, fenestration, atrial arrhythmias, and for those with ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 percent. (See <a href=\"#H13723701\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PLE can present weeks to years after Fontan procedure. Five-year survival after PLE diagnosis is around 50 percent. Management should include exclusion of reversible mechanical causes of elevated central venous pressure, medical therapy, and in select cases catheter-based or surgical intervention, including heart transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H13723709\" class=\"local\">'Protein-losing enteropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients post-Fontan are at risk for liver disease, although the overall incidence is unknown. The most effective method of surveillance for liver disease in Fontan patients is uncertain. We suggest routine liver imaging (MRI or CT) every three to five years in patients who are five or more years out from their Fontan operation. Patients with features of cirrhosis require close monitoring, due to high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
