This system incorporates the anatomic extent of disease, including the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), distant metastases (M), and margin status (R). In addition, the baseline serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and histologic grade group (based upon the Gleason score) are incorporated to divide patients into prognostic stage groupings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81673\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81673 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

For patients whose initial treatment includes radical prostatectomy, additional information is obtained from the histopathologic examination of the prostatectomy specimen, and this forms the basis for the pathologic (&quot;p&quot;) stage.</p><p>Clinical staging may underestimate or overestimate the anatomic extent of disease. Patients with cT1 or cT2 N0 disease may be reclassified as pT3 or N1 based upon these results. Conversely, patients thought to have more extensive (cT3) disease may be reclassified as pT2. If surgical margins are positive for tumor (residual microscopic disease), staging is modified by an &quot;R1&quot; descriptor, while negative margins are designated &quot;R0.&quot;</p><p>Pathologic T3 involvement is defined by the presence of extraprostatic disease. Pathologic stage T3 is subdivided into pT3a, which includes extraprostatic extension, sometimes also called &quot;extracapsular&quot; extension, or microscopic invasion of the bladder neck, and pT3b, which includes those cases with seminal vesicle invasion.

With extraprostatic extension (pT3a), local control tends to be more of a problem, particularly in the presence of positive margins. In contrast, men with seminal vesicle invasion (pT3b) are at higher risk for distant disease recurrence, regardless of the status of the surgical margins. The effectiveness of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) may differ in patients with pT3a disease as compared with those with pT3b disease. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant RT'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of men with positive resection margins (R1) after radical prostatectomy is variable. Even when multiple positive margins are present, not all men recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. </p><p>The variable natural history is illustrated by a contemporary multicenter analysis in which positive surgical margins were identified in 2607 of 11,521 men (23 percent) who had undergone radical prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. At a median follow-up of 56 months, the 15-year cancer recurrence rate was significantly increased compared with those with negative margins (10 versus 6 percent). However, in a multivariable analysis that incorporated factors such as Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion, and the use of postoperative RT, the effect of positive surgical margins was not statistically significant. An understanding of the impact of positive surgical margins and adjuvant therapy requires recognition of factors that are modifiable and those that are not. Non-modifiable risk factors are largely due to the inherent biology of the disease and will drive both recurrence rates and the impact adjuvant therapy has on the course of the disease.</p><p>Multiple factors have been identified that influence the risk of recurrence when a positive margin is identified in the surgical specimen.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk classification of the patient at presentation influences the likelihood of recurrence in those with a positive surgical margin. In a single institution series of 1268 patients, 21 percent of cases had positive surgical margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. At a median follow-up of over six years, the risk of biochemical recurrence was increased in all risk groups at presentation:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low risk (PSA &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> Gleason score &le;6, or T1-T2a) &ndash; the risk of recurrence in those with positive and negative margins was 5.1 and 0.4 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intermediate risk (PSA 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> Gleason score 7, or <span class=\"nowrap\">T2b/T2c)</span> &ndash; the risk of recurrence was 17 and 6.5 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High risk (PSA &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> Gleason score &ge;8, or T3) &ndash; the risk of recurrence was 43 and 21.5 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On multivariate analysis, these differences were significant for those with intermediate- and high-risk disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number and location of positive margins influences the risk of recurrence. In a series of 1667 evaluable men who underwent radical prostatectomy, the overall three-year frequency of biochemical recurrence was 5.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this series, 1295 had negative margins, 96 had a solitary positive apical margin, 82 had a solitary nonapical margin, and 194 had multiple positive margins (78, 6, 5, and 12 percent, respectively). Among those with a solitary positive apical margin, a solitary positive nonapical margin, and multiple positive margins, the three-year rates of biochemical recurrence were 13, 18.6, and 27 percent, respectively. However, late relapses may be seen for many years after radical prostatectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary Gleason score at the positive surgical margin also influences the likelihood of systemic progression and cancer-specific survival. In a series of 1036 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy, 338 (33 percent) had positive margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At a median follow-up of 13 years, primary Gleason grade 4 at the resection margin was associated with a worse systemic disease-free survival compared with those with a primary Gleason grade 3 or negative surgical margins (74 versus 90 versus 93 percent, respectively). Similarly, cancer-specific survival was worse in this group (86 versus 96 versus 97 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255203697\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with adverse pathologic findings, including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, and extraprostatic extension, should be informed that adjuvant radiation therapy (RT), compared with radical prostatectomy only, reduces the risk of biochemical (prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) recurrence, local recurrence, and clinical progression of cancer. This approach is based upon the results of completed clinical trials discussed below and is consistent with current American Urological Association (AUA) and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with limited, focally positive surgical margins and no other high-risk factors are at lower risk for biochemical or clinical recurrence. Although there is no evidence from randomized trials limited to this patient subset, we often suggest careful observation with immediate salvage RT when the PSA becomes detectable, since adjuvant radiation appears to adversely affect urinary continence. This approach avoids RT complications in those who will never require additional treatment and may minimize RT toxicity, since adjuvant radiation appears to adversely affect urinary continence. (See <a href=\"#H3024802534\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant RT versus early salvage RT'</a> below.)</p><p>We do not routinely recommend using androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in conjunction with adjuvant RT following prostatectomy. However, this approach can be considered in men with multiple features of high-risk disease (eg, Gleason &ge;8, positive seminal vesicles, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positive margins).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) decreases the risk of biochemical relapse, but it requires administering RT to some patients who would otherwise never require treatment (ie, over-treatment). In contrast, postoperative surveillance without treatment followed by salvage RT at the first evidence of a rising serum PSA entails the risk that distant metastases might develop in some men who would have been rendered disease-free with immediate adjuvant RT.</p><p>For men with extensively positive surgical margins, pathologic stage T3 disease, or other high risk factors, we recommend adjuvant external beam RT following radical prostatectomy. For patients choosing not to receive postoperative RT, we recommend careful monitoring for evidence of a biochemical recurrence, followed by salvage RT when the PSA becomes detectable.</p><p>Extended follow-up from large clinical trials provides evidence that adjuvant RT is well tolerated and that it improves the biochemical and local control rates in men who are found to have pT3 disease or diffusely positive resection margins at radical prostatectomy. There is also increasing evidence that postoperative RT improves metastasis-free and overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>Consistent with quality of life data from the prospective randomized Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) trial 8794 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], there are retrospective data that suggest that patients who are treated with adjuvant RT following radical prostatectomy may have a lower rate of urinary continence recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, such observations may simply reflect differences in the populations given such adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, data from the SWOG trial suggest that overall quality of life five years following surgery for patients receiving adjuvant RT is superior to that for those patients undergoing surgery alone. This finding may be attributed to fewer patients requiring salvage androgen deprivation in the adjuvant RT arm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative RT in men with pT3 or margin-positive disease has been compared with observation in several randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/17-19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19,21,22</a>]. The results of the two largest trials with extended follow-up illustrate the outcomes with this approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial 22911 randomly assigned 1005 men with pT3 disease or positive margins following radical prostatectomy to postoperative external beam RT (60 Gy) to the surgical bed or to observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At a median follow-up of 10.6 years, 198 of 502 men (39.4 percent) who received adjuvant RT had biochemical or clinical progression, compared with 311 of 503 (61.8 percent) managed with a wait-and-see policy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.41-0.59).

At a longer median follow-up than the EORTC trial (12.6 years), adjuvant RT significantly improved both metastasis-free and overall survival compared with observation (median 14.7 versus 12.9 years, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.94 and median 15.2 versus 13.3 years, HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subset analyses found that the benefits in metastasis-free and overall survival were independent of the Gleason score and included men with either detectable or undetectable postprostatectomy PSA levels and those with positive margins or seminal vesicle involvement. Adverse effects were more common in men receiving adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These included rectal complications (3.3 versus 0 percent without adjuvant RT), urethral strictures (17.8 versus 9.5 percent), and total urinary incontinence (6.5 versus 2.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In this trial, only one-third of the patients originally assigned to observation received salvage RT at the time of a biochemical recurrence, and these results cannot be used to compare a strategy of adjuvant RT with observation followed by salvage RT at the first sign of PSA recurrence.</p><p/><p>Both the EORTC 22911 and SWOG 8794 trials were initiated before the widespread use of sensitive assays to detect PSA recurrence, and patients in the observation group had no further treatment until clinical relapse. Current practice often involves salvage RT at the first sign of biochemical relapse (PSA &gt;0.10), and these trials thus did not adequately address the question of whether early salvage therapy is as effective as immediate adjuvant therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our practice is to recommend a dose of 60 to 64 Gy in the adjuvant setting, although the optimal dose of radiation has not been determined in randomized trials.

At least one observational study, which included 334 men who received adjuvant RT following radical prostatectomy and a negative lymph node dissection, found improved biochemical relapse-free survival when doses greater than 70 Gy were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the applicability of this observation is limited by the nonrandomized design of this study and the improvements in RT techniques during the study period.</p><p>Additional trials will be required before higher doses can be recommended.
