MEN2 is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and primary parathyroid hyperplasia. The genetic defect in MEN2 involves the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene on chromosome 10. As expected from its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, men and women with MEN type 2A (MEN2A) are affected in equal proportions.</p><p>Although MEN2 is rare, recognition is important both for treatment and for evaluation of family members. MEN2 is often first suspected when a patient is found to have one or more of the tumors, but molecular DNA testing is now available for detecting asymptomatic patients with MEN2.</p><p>This topic will review the classification and genetics of the MEN2 syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101551 \">table 1</a>).

It is a heritable predisposition to medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and primary parathyroid hyperplasia. The respective frequency of these tumors in classical MEN2A is over 90 percent for MTC, approximately 10 to 50 percent for pheochromocytoma, and 10 to 20 percent for multigland parathyroid hyperplasia. The frequency of the development of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia depends upon the specific <em>RET</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The diagnosis of CLA may precede the onset of clinically evident MTC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65753%7EENDO%2F69450\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65753 graphicRef69450 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Patients with this variant develop pheochromocytomas and parathyroid hyperplasia with a similar frequency as those with classical MEN2A.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606938\"><span class=\"h3\">MEN2A with Hirschsprung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HD is a motor disorder of the gut that is caused by the failure of neural crest cells (precursors of enteric ganglion cells) to migrate completely during intestinal development. The resulting aganglionic segment of the colon fails to relax, causing a functional obstruction. At least eight genetic mutations have been identified in patients with HD. The predominant gene affected is the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene. <em>RET</em> malfunction accounts for at least 50 percent of familial and 20 percent of sporadic cases of HD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;, section on 'Genes'</a>.)</p><p>In one study, the prevalence of HD in MEN2 was 7.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The frequency of HD in MEN2A depends upon the specific <em>RET</em> mutation. The co-occurrence of HD and MEN2A is predominantly associated with <em>RET</em> mutations involving codons 609, 611, 618, and 620 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In such patients, HD may be the first presentation of MEN2A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with this variant of MEN2A develop MTC, pheochromocytomas, and parathyroid hyperplasia with a similar frequency as those with classical MEN2A.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606757\"><span class=\"h3\">Familial medullary thyroid cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FMTC is a variant of MEN2A in which there is a strong predisposition to MTC but not the other clinical manifestations of MEN2A (or 2B). The clinical distinction of FMTC from MEN2A may be difficult on statistical grounds in small families; even in some large kindreds, the clinical designation of FMTC has been changed to MEN2A after the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism in a family member. Because FMTC is the most limited variant of MEN2, making the wrong diagnosis of FMTC could result in missing a pheochromocytoma in a patient with MEN2. Therefore, an FMTC kindred should be defined using the following rigorous criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 10 carriers in the kindred</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple carriers or affected members over the age of 50 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An adequate medical history, particularly in older family members</p><p/><p>Why pheochromocytomas and hyperparathyroidism infrequently develop in these families is still unknown since many FMTC and MEN2A families carry identical <em>RET</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In rare families, both HD and FMTC appear to segregate.</p><p>In a report summarizing data from 250 Italian kindreds with hereditary MTC, the prevalence of the FMTC phenotype among <em>RET</em> mutation carriers was higher than MEN2A and MEN2B (57 versus 34 and 6.8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This may be related to the introduction of <em>RET</em> screening in the work-up of apparently sporadic MTC and the more extensive search for <em>RET</em> mutations in non-hot spot regions of the gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of MEN2B has been estimated at roughly 6 percent of all MEN2 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. MEN2B shares the inherited predisposition to MTC and pheochromocytoma that occurs in MEN2A. On the other hand, parathyroid hyperplasia is not a feature of this disorder. There are additional important clinical differences. Patients with MEN2B tend to have mucosal neuromas, typically involving the lips and tongue, and intestinal ganglioneuromas. Disturbances of colonic function are common, including chronic constipation and megacolon. Many of these patients have development abnormalities, a Marfanoid habitus, and myelinated corneal nerves.</p><p>MTC is the most common component of the MEN2B syndrome. Furthermore, the tumor is often more aggressive and of earlier onset than in MEN2A; as a result, early diagnosis and prevention are particularly critical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A (MEN2A) and 2B (MEN2B) are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with very high penetrance. The genetic defect in these disorders involves the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene on chromosome 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/9,10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392452\"><span class=\"h2\">Structure and function of the normal RET proto-oncogene and its product</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RET protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase that appears to transduce growth and differentiation signals in several developing tissues, including those derived from the neural crest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The protein consists of an extracellular part with a ligand-binding domain, a cadherin (calcium-dependent cell adhesion)-like domain, and a cysteine-rich domain close to the cell membrane. It has a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular part with two tyrosine kinase subdomains, TK1 and TK2.</p><p>Activation of RET occurs by the binding of one of its four ligands, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (TNT), artemin, or persephin, which require their specific co-receptors GDNF-receptor-family-a-1 (GFR-a-1), GFR-a-2, GFR-a-3, and GFR-a-4, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Interaction of these molecules results in dimerization of RET, cross-autophosphorylation, and subsequent phosphorylation of intracellular substrates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75557 \">figure 1</a>). <em>RET</em> is expressed in the C-cells of the thyroid gland, adrenal medulla, neurons, and in other tissues. In mice, GDNF or RET play crucial roles in the differentiation and survival of central nervous system neurons, the development of the peripheral nervous system, and the development of the kidneys and ureters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392467\"><span class=\"h2\">Structure and function of the mutated RET proto-oncogene and its product</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are differences but much overlap in the specific <em>RET</em> gene mutations underlying the MEN2A variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/9,10,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,24,25</a>]; however, MEN2B is caused by specific <em>RET</em> mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71594 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/13,24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24,26</a>]. Several studies, including one from the International RET Mutation Consortium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], have described the relationships between the site of mutation and the type of disease.

This is different from many other inherited predispositions to neoplasia which are due to heritable &quot;loss-of-function&quot; mutations that inactivate tumor suppressor proteins. The functional constraints for such activating lesions are probably responsible for the small number of sites at which <em>RET</em> mutations are found, a limitation that is of great benefit for molecular diagnosis in this disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Germline mutations in the extracellular domain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of mutations in MEN2A kindreds involve one of six cysteine residues in the cysteine-rich region of the RET protein's extracellular domain encoded in <em>RET</em> exons 10 (codons 609, 611, 618, and 620) or 11 (codons 630 or 634) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71594 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These extracellular <span class=\"nowrap\">MEN2A/familial</span> medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC) cysteine mutations lead to a ligand-independent dimerization of receptor molecules and constitutive activation of intracellular signaling pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52243\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52243 \">figure 3</a>). A mutation in codon 634 in exon 11 is associated with hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma in MEN2A and is the most common genetic defect in this disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71594 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The penetrance of hyperparathyroidism in those with mutations at this site is approximately 20 percent.

Specific <em>RET</em> mutations have been detected in sporadic medullary thyroid cancers (MTCs) and pheochromocytomas, whereas such mutations have not been detected in sporadically occurring parathyroid adenomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Germline mutations in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Germline mutations in codons 768 (exon 13), 804 (exon 14), and 891 (exon 15) are predominantly associated with FMTC, but they account for only a minority of cases of this disorder.

A single 918 Met to Thr mutation in exon 16 is responsible for over 95 percent of cases of MEN2B and is found only in this disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52243\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52243 \">figure 3</a>). Met 918 is a critical component of the substrate recognition pocket in the tyrosine kinase catalytic core of the RET protein. In more than 50 percent of cases of MEN2B with codon 918 affected, mutations occur as new (de novo) germline mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The genetic defect in MEN2 involves the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene on chromosome 10. Although MEN2 is rare, recognition is important both for treatment and for evaluation of family members. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MEN2 is subclassified into two distinct syndromes: types 2A (MEN2A) and 2B (MEN2B) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101551 \">table 1</a>). Within MEN2A, there are four variants. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classical MEN2A is a heritable predisposition to medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and primary parathyroid hyperplasia. The respective frequency of these tumors in classical MEN2A is over 90 percent for MTC, approximately 40 to 50 percent for pheochromocytoma, and 10 to 20 percent for multigland parathyroid hyperplasia. The frequency of the development of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia depends upon the specific <em>RET</em> mutation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MEN2B shares the inherited predisposition to MTC and pheochromocytoma that occurs in MEN2A. Patients with MEN2B also tend to have mucosal neuromas, intestinal ganglioneuromas, and, in some instances, a Marfanoid habitus; on the other hand, parathyroid hyperplasia is not a feature of this disorder. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The germline <em>RET</em> mutations in MEN2 result in a <strong>gain</strong> of function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52243\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52243 \">figure 3</a>). This is different from many other inherited predispositions to neoplasia, which are due to heritable &quot;loss-of-function&quot; mutations that inactivate tumor suppressor proteins. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Germline mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of mutations in MEN2A kindreds involve one of five cysteine residues in the cysteine-rich region of the RET protein's extracellular domain encoded in <em>RET</em> exons 10 (codons 609, 611, 618, and 620) or 11 (codon 634) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71594 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Germline mutations in the extracellular domain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single Met to Thr mutation in exon 16 (codon 918) is responsible for over 95 percent of cases of MEN2B and is found only in this disorder. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Germline mutations in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The distinct clinical course of the disease in a family (frequency of pheochromocytoma and parathyroid gland adenoma, and life expectancy) primarily depends upon the specific <em>RET</em> gene germline mutation that is present. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Genotype-phenotype correlation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advances in the molecular genetics underlying the MEN2 syndromes have resulted in DNA testing becoming the optimal test for their detection.
