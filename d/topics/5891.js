Doctors use the term &quot;elbow tendinopathy&quot; when people have a problem with a tendon in the elbow. Tendons are strong bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Depending on which elbow tendon is injured, the condition is also known as &quot;tennis elbow&quot; or &quot;golf elbow.&quot;</p><p>In most people with elbow tendinopathy, the tendons are not inflamed or swollen. If they do get inflamed or swollen, doctors call it &quot;tendinitis.&quot;</p><p>Tendinitis usually starts suddenly. Tendinopathy usually happens over a longer period of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22903294\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes elbow tendinopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This condition can happen as people get older, especially if they do a lot of work or activity using their elbow and forearm. Tendinitis can happen when people get hurt or do the same movements over and over.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22903301\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of elbow tendinopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elbow pain &ndash; The pain can start slowly or suddenly. It can spread to the upper arm or forearm.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness of the forearm muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling (if people have tendinitis)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22903308\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for elbow tendinopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by talking with you and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22903315\"><span class=\"h1\">How is elbow tendinopathy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, this condition will get better on its own, but it can take months to heal completely. To help get better, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your elbow and arm &ndash; Ask your doctor about wearing an arm brace.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine &ndash; Your doctor might recommend that you take a medicine such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22903322\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can do different exercises to help with your symptoms. The right exercises for you will depend on which elbow tendon is injured. The following exercises can help stretch the lower arm muscles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tennis elbow stretch &ndash; Hold your injured arm straight out, and point your fingers down to the ground. Use your other hand (with the thumb pressing on the palm) to grab this hand. Then press down on the back of the hand to bend the wrist more (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65485\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65485 \">picture 1</a>). Hold this position for 30 seconds. Repeat the stretch 3 times. Do this exercise 1 time a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Golf elbow stretch &ndash; Stand an arm's length away from the wall, with the injured arm closest to the wall. Put your palm on the wall, with your fingers pointing down. Press gently against the wall to stretch your muscles. Hold this position for 30 seconds. Repeat the stretch 3 times. Do this exercise 1 time a day.</p><p/><p>Other types of exercises can help make the forearm muscles stronger. Your doctor, nurse, or physical therapist (exercise expert) can show you how to do these types of exercises. He or she will tell you when to start them and how often to do them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22903329\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my symptoms don't get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your symptoms don't get better, talk with your doctor or nurse.

To help prevent elbow tendinopathy, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take breaks when you do activities in which you move your elbow and wrist a lot.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your elbows slightly bent when you exercise or lift things.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear gloves or use 2 hands when using tools.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a 2-handed backhand swing in tennis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use grip tape or padding on your golf clubs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22903343\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=biceps-tendinopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Biceps tendinopathy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rotator cuff injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbow-tendinopathy-tennis-and-golf-elbow-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Elbow tendinopathy (tennis and golf elbow) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=biceps-tendinitis-or-tendinopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Biceps tendinitis or tendinopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinitis-and-tear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rotator cuff tendinitis and tear (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
