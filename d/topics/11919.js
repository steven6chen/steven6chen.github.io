This complex series of physical transitions is known as puberty, and these changes may impact psychosocial factors.</p><p>The most visible changes during puberty are growth in stature and development of secondary sexual characteristics. Equally profound are changes in body composition; the achievement of fertility; and changes in most body systems, such as bone, with increased growth and mineralization, brain development, and the cardiovascular system, with greater aerobic power reserve, electrocardiographic changes, and blood pressure changes.</p><p>The normal sequence of pubertal events and potential perils of puberty are reviewed here. Precocious and delayed puberty are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puberty is the general term for the transition from sexual immaturity to sexual maturity. There are two main physiological events in puberty:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gonadarche</strong> is the activation of the gonads by the pituitary hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adrenarche</strong> is the increase in production of androgens by the adrenal cortex. </p><p/><p>While puberty encompasses changes due to both gonadarche and adrenarche, the term &quot;puberty&quot; is often used to refer specifically to gonadarche and associated changes, particularly in the phrases &quot;precocious puberty&quot; and &quot;delayed puberty.&quot; Adrenarche is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-adrenarche\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal adrenarche&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=premature-adrenarche\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Premature adrenarche&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A number of other terms describe specific components of puberty:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thelarche</strong> is the appearance of breast tissue, which is primarily due to the action of estradiol from the ovaries. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Menarche</strong> is the time of first menstrual bleed. The first menstrual bleed is often not associated with ovulation; it typically is caused solely by the effects of estradiol on the endometrial lining. Menstrual bleeding in regular menstrual cycles after maturity is caused by the interplay of estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spermarche</strong> is the time of the first sperm production (heralded by nocturnal sperm emissions and appearance of sperm in the urine), which is due to the effects of FSH and LH, via testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pubarche</strong> is the appearance of pubic hair, which is primarily due to the effects of androgens from the adrenal gland. The term is also applied to first appearance of axillary hair, apocrine body odor, and acne.</p><p/><p><strong>Precocious puberty</strong> (more accurately, precocious gonadarche) is defined as pubertal onset at an age 2 to 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean age of onset of puberty. In the United States, this has led to a traditional definition of precocious puberty as the appearance of breast development before the age of eight years in girls, and testicular enlargement before the age of nine years in boys. However, the age threshold for undertaking a clinical evaluation for early puberty remains a subject of ongoing discussion. For girls who develop signs of puberty between six and eight years of age, the need for clinical evaluation depends on the degree and rate of maturation as well as the family history of pubertal timing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a>.) </p><p><strong>Delayed puberty</strong> is defined as the absence of signs of puberty by an age 2 to 3 SD above the mean age of onset of puberty, ie, by an age at which 95 to 98 percent of children of that sex and culture have initiated sexual maturation. In the United States, this corresponds to an upper limit of 12 to 13 years for girls (for breast development) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>], and of 13 to 14 years for boys (for testicular enlargement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1402198082\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY AND ENDOCRINOLOGY OF PUBERTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonadarche is driven by an increase in the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, resulting in increases in both frequency and amplitude of pulses of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a>). GnRH stimulates the gonadotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland to secrete follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH, which in turn stimulate sex-steroidogenesis and eventually gametogenesis in the gonads. </p><p>In girls, FSH stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles and, in conjunction with LH, stimulates production of estradiol by the ovaries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98701\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98701 \">figure 1A</a>). Early in puberty, estradiol stimulates breast development and growth of the skeleton, leading to pubertal growth acceleration. Later in puberty, the interplay between pituitary secretion of FSH and LH, and secretion of estradiol by ovarian follicles leads to ovulation and menstrual cycles (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>). Estradiol also induces maturation of the skeleton, eventually resulting in fusion of the growth plates and cessation of linear growth. </p><p>In boys, LH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to produce testosterone, the high local concentration of which stimulates the growth of the seminiferous tubules, leading to an increase in testicular volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98702\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98702 \">figure 1B</a>). FSH stimulates further growth of seminiferous tubules and increases in testicular volume. Testosterone also induces growth of the penis, deepening of the voice, growth of hair, and increases in muscularity. Some testosterone is converted to estradiol, which has the same effects on growth and skeletal maturation as in girls (and can also lead to some breast development in males, as it does in females). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Gynecomastia'</a> below.) </p><p>Though temporally correlated, gonadarche and adrenarche are physiologically distinct events. Individuals with defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can still undergo adrenarche. Similarly, individuals with no adrenal function can achieve gonadarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Adrenarche begins when the zona reticularis of the adrenal gland begins to synthesize the adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. Though less potent than testosterone, these induce androgenic changes including growth of pubic and axillary hair, maturation of the apocrine sweat glands (leading to adult-type body odor), and development of acne. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-adrenarche\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal adrenarche&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PUBERTAL CHANGES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual maturity rating (Tanner stages)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puberty consists of a series of events that usually proceed in a predictable pattern with some variation in timing of onset, sequence, and tempo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52047%7EPEDS%2F72046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52047 graphicRef72046 \">figure 2A-B</a>). </p><p>The staging system utilized most frequently is that of sexual maturity ratings (SMR). These are also known as &quot;Tanner stages&quot; because they were initially published by Marshall and Tanner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. These consist of systematized descriptions of the development of secondary sexual characteristics, consisting of breast changes in females, genital changes in males, and pubic hair changes in both males and females. SMR for pubic hair, breast, and genitalia consists of five stages, with stage 1 representing prepuberty and stage 5 representing adult development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55329 \">table 1</a>). The stages are illustrated by the figure in girls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038%7EPEDS%2F79782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 graphicRef79782 \">picture 1A-B</a>) and boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>As is discussed below, the timing of pubertal maturation has an important influence on self-esteem, behavior, growth, and weight. As an example, early maturation is associated with slightly shorter adult stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] and with greater adult ponderosity and adiposity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Details of the physiologic changes expected during puberty are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Sequence of pubertal maturation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth spurt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 17 to 18 percent of adult height accrues during puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The timing of the growth spurt (peak height velocity) varies by sex, occurring approximately two years earlier in girls than in boys. The increase in height affects both axial (trunk) and appendicular (limb) components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The limbs accelerate before the trunk, with the distal portions of the limbs accelerating before the proximal portions; thus, the adolescent in early puberty is &quot;all hands and feet.&quot; In later puberty, however, the growth spurt is primarily truncal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Height velocity can be plotted and compared with norms using height velocity growth charts. The most commonly used charts are those published by Tanner and Davies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96367%7EPEDS%2F96366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96367 graphicRef96366 \">figure 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although these are used for longitudinal tracking and acknowledge the variation between early, average, and late maturers, their accuracy is limited because they were prepared from cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data. Other growth charts were generated from longitudinal data, such as the series of charts published by the Harvard Six-Cities study, but are less widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The disparity in mean adult height between men and women results from the timing and magnitude of the growth spurt in boys and girls. In girls, peak height velocity occurs, on average, 0.5 years prior to menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Because the pubertal growth spurt starts approximately two years later in boys than in girls, boys have an additional two years of prepubertal growth (at a rate of 3 to 8 cm per year) compared with girls at the time the growth spurt starts. Furthermore, boys experience a greater peak height velocity than do girls (10.3 versus 9.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96367%7EPEDS%2F96366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96367 graphicRef96366 \">figure 3A-B</a>). The growth spurt typically lasts for about two years in both sexes. Modest seasonal variations in growth have been reported even in well-nourished populations, with greater growth typically occurring in the spring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Extremely early onset of puberty (precocious puberty) results in earlier peak height velocity, which often leads to a transient period of tall stature, but is associated with reduced adult height due to early epiphyseal closure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-precocious-puberty#H23809000\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'Decision to treat'</a>). Whether pubertal onset that is early but within the normal range is also associated with reduced adult stature is less clear. In one study in girls, early menarche was associated with greater peak height velocity but shorter adult stature, while early thelarche had no effect on adult stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a study in boys, those who mature relatively early but within the normal range had a modest reduction in adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The diminished adult height was attributable to shorter leg length; sitting height was not reduced. Body weight appears to influence these results: in the same study, boys who were underweight during childhood tended to have longer leg length and no change in adult height. It is probably not appropriate to extrapolate these results to girls because obesity is sometimes associated with earlier onset of puberty in girls, and obesity may have the opposite effect in boys. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities and complications of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Growth and puberty'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82698138\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone growth accelerates during puberty, in concert with height velocity, but bone mineralization lags behind. Bone growth occurs first in length, followed by width, then mineral content, and then bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The rate of bone mineral accrual peaks around the age of menarche in girls, which occurs approximately 9 to 12 months later than peak height velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The disparity in the timing of bone growth and mineralization may place the growing adolescent at increased risk for fracture. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal injuries'</a> below.) </p><p>Approximately one-half of total body calcium is laid down during puberty in females, and one-half to two-thirds in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>]. By the end of puberty, males have nearly 50 percent more total body calcium than do females. The increase in bone density during puberty is greater in African-American females than in Caucasian females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>The risk for osteoporosis during adulthood may be related to both specific &quot;insults&quot; and the timing of factors impacting bone deposition during puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These data suggest that the window of opportunity to maximize peak bone mass may be limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Possible effects of certain hormonal contraceptives on peak bone mass are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-osteoporosis#H9840736\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Maximizing peak bone mass'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraception-issues-specific-to-adolescents#H1127198982\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraception: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;, section on 'Depot medroxyprogesterone'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight and body composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puberty is associated with significant changes in body weight and alterations in body composition, especially in lean body mass and the proportion of body fat (adiposity), with different patterns in girls as compared with boys. Growth curves for body mass index (BMI) describe the typical increase in body mass that occurs during puberty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60784%7EPEDS%2F68478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60784 graphicRef68478 \">figure 4A-B</a>), but do not reflect the differences between early-maturing and late-maturing children, nor do they distinguish between changes in lean body mass versus adipose tissue.</p><p>In early puberty, the annual increase in BMI is driven primarily by changes in lean body mass. Later, the increase in BMI tends to be driven by increases in fat mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This general pattern diverges between the genders: boys tend to have a decrease in body fat in early puberty and then proceed to a substantial increase in lean body mass. Girls tend to have a higher proportion of fat mass than boys at each phase, and after 16 years of age, the annual increase in BMI is largely because of increases in fat mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. These general patterns are altered by the individual's nutritional status; either boys or girls who gain excessive weight during puberty may experience an ongoing increase in body fat, regardless of gender or pubertal stage. Obesity tracks from adolescence to adulthood and earlier onset of obesity is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-and-complications-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities and complications of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SEQUENCE OF PUBERTAL MATURATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some variability occurs between individuals with regard to the timing, sequence, and tempo of pubertal maturation. However, most adolescents follow a predictable path through pubertal maturation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Girls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest detectable secondary sexual characteristic on physical examination in most girls is <span class=\"nowrap\">breast/areolar</span> development (thelarche) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 \">picture 1A</a>), although about 15 percent have pubic hair as the initial manifestation (pubarche) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79782 \">picture 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Ovarian enlargement and growth acceleration typically precede breast development but are not apparent on a single physical examination. Estrogen stimulation of the vaginal mucosa causes a physiologic leukorrhea, which is a thin, white, non-foul-smelling vaginal discharge that typically begins 6 to 12 months before menarche. Menarche occurs, on average, 2 to 2.5 years after the onset of puberty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52047\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52047 \">figure 2A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/11,19,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: The perineum&quot;, section on 'Preadolescent and adolescent females'</a>.)</p><p>The likelihood of pubarche as the initial manifestation of puberty increases threefold with maternal preeclampsia; the likelihood is directly related to the severity of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The initial manifestation predicts body morphology and composition throughout pubertal maturation into early adulthood. As an example, girls with breast development as the initial manifestation of puberty have both an earlier age of menarche and greater body mass index (BMI) throughout puberty and as adults, as compared with girls who exhibit pubarche first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Earlier menarche (before 12 years of age) is associated with higher BMI during adulthood as compared with later menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/15,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,38-40</a>]. Most of this effect may be attributable to the influence of childhood obesity on both menarcheal age and adult obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Boys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest stage of male maturation that is detectable on physical examination is an increase in testicular volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60225\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60225 \">figure 5</a>). Almost all boys have an increase in testicular size (volume &ge;4 mL and length &ge;2.5 cm) approximately six months prior to the appearance of penile growth and pubic hair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/34,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,42</a>]. The appearance of sperm in the urine and the onset of nocturnal sperm emissions occur shortly after the attainment of peak height velocity; many consider these events the male equivalent of menarche (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72046 \">figure 2B</a>). </p><p>Testicular volume is typically measured using the Prader orchidometer, a series of three-dimensional ellipsoids with a volume from 1 to 25 mL or more. </p><p>Penile length is measured using a straight edge on the dorsal surface in the non-erect state from the pubic ramus to the tip of the glans while compressing the suprapubic fat pad and applying gentle traction. Mean stretched penile length is approximately 3.75 cm (&plusmn; 0.54 cm) at one year of age and gradually increases to 4.84 cm by late childhood, then increases sharply to about 9.5 cm (&plusmn; 1.12 cm) by late puberty (according to measurements from a predominantly white population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This measurement is rarely used for monitoring of pubertal progress because penile growth is not an early event in puberty, accurate measurement is difficult and may be awkward for the adolescent boy, and there is not as clear of a &quot;pubertal threshold&quot; for penile stretched length as there is for testicular volume. </p><p>Although there is some temporal variation in the appearance and progression of testicular volume, penile growth, and pubic hair development, a clear discrepancy between these physical findings may indicate a pathological condition. For example, a finding of small testicular volumes in a fully virilized adolescent boy may be a sign of Klinefelter syndrome or inappropriate use of exogenous testosterone. The following figure provides a guide for the clinician to evaluate the relationship between testicular volume and pubic hair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60225\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60225 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H334358183\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF PUBERTAL EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the timing of pubertal onset varies widely among individuals of a given sex and ethnic background (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above). Demographic studies over the past 15 to 20 years have indicated a trend towards earlier pubertal timing in girls and likely boys as well (a trend that has captured the attention of the lay press, which often exaggerates the findings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conflates early pubertal and late pubertal events, such as thelarche and menarche).

In a 1997 study of over 18,000 females from the United States and Puerto Rico, Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS), the earliest signs of puberty were at ages considerably younger than had been reported previously, and striking racial differences in timing were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The mean ages for the onset of breast development were 8.87 years in African-American girls and 9.96 years in white girls, and the mean age for pubic hair growth was 8.78 years in African American girls and 10.51 years in white girls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72226 \">figure 6</a>). In a subsequent longitudinal study of over 1200 girls conducted a decade later, white participants began to mature earlier than white participants in the PROS study (9.62 years contrasted with 9.96 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, participants with body mass index (BMI) &gt;85<sup>th</sup> percentile matured before those &lt;85<sup>th</sup> percentile (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, studies comparing the timing of menarche between African American and white girls have reported smaller differences. </p><p>Pubertal onset in boys also appears to be occurring earlier in the United States. In a study including more than 4000 healthy boys, the mean age for entering puberty (sexual maturity rating [SMR] for genital development stage 2) was 10.14 years for white boys, 10.04 years for Hispanic boys, and 9.14 years for African American boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These thresholds are 1.5 to 2 years earlier than historical norms. Similar trends have been reported from several European and Scandinavian countries and China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>]. The relationship between pubertal onset and obesity in boys is not clear, with some studies suggesting report that increased BMI and fat mass is associated with earlier puberty in boys, similar to findings in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/6,44,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,44,49,50</a>], while others suggest the opposite association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/42,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,51-53</a>]. A possible explanation for these disparate findings comes from a study that found a non-linear relationship between body weight and pubertal onset in boys, with earlier onset of puberty in boys with increasing BMI except for the most obese boys, who instead exhibited later pubertal timing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These results are consistent with an earlier study that reported earlier onset of puberty in boys with increasing BMI until a high mass of adipose tissue mass was attained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] (see <a href=\"#H457304473\" class=\"local\">'Body fat and leptin'</a> below). Potential mechanisms include peripheral aromatization of adrenal androgens in adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], or environmental exposures with estrogenic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiandrogenic effects, which also act as obesogens. </p><p>The earlier onset of puberty has had important implications for the diagnosis of precocious puberty. Precocious puberty usually has been defined as breast development prior to eight years of age in girls and testicular enlargement before the age of nine years in boys. Because of the earlier onset of puberty in the United States, it has been suggested that a threshold of seven years in white girls and six years in African American girls be used for evaluation for precocious puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Following these suggestions may lead to under-diagnosis of endocrine disorders, and the appropriate threshold for evaluation remains controversial and probably varies among populations; the need for evaluation depends not only on age but also on the degree and rate of maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82698679\"><span class=\"h2\">Determinants of pubertal timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetics accounts for the majority of the variability in the timing of pubertal onset in developed countries. The timing of puberty and menarche in a girl is best predicted by the timing of menarche in her mother (see <a href=\"#H1402198752\" class=\"local\">'Physiology of pubertal onset'</a> below). Other factors that influence pubertal onset include overall health (with poor health associated with delayed pubertal onset), and social environment (such as family stress or the presence of an adult nonbiologically-related male in the household, which are associated with earlier pubertal onset) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/57-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-61</a>]. Studies have suggested an interaction between genetics and the environment. As an example, age of menarche is generally earlier in African American as compared with white girls, but the difference between the groups decreased between the 1970s and the 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The influence of environmental factors, including endocrine disruptors, on timing of pubertal maturation is a subject of active research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H334357397\" class=\"local\">'Trends in pubertal timing'</a> above.)</p><p>Pubertal timing varies substantially between <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnic</span> groups. In a 2001 study in the United States, the rates of early maturation (defined as menarche &le;11 years) were 7.8 percent for white, 12.3 percent for black, 13.6 percent for Hispanic, and 5.2 percent for Asian girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The frequency of late maturation (menarche &ge;14 years) ranged from 15.2 percent among white girls to 27 percent among Asian girls. This relationship appears to be primarily mediated by differences in rates of overweight; within each <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnic</span> group, early maturing girls were approximately twice as likely to be overweight as compared with those maturing at an average age. The data in this study did not establish whether the relationship between age of menarche and obesity varies among racial and ethnic groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457304473\"><span class=\"h3\">Body fat and leptin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been proposed that a critical body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] or percent body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] is the primary determinant of the development and maintenance of pubertal events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/38,64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,64-66</a>]. However, body weight or composition alone probably is not a sufficient explanation. The overall earlier onset of puberty among the general population has been attributed to the increasing prevalence of obesity, but again it is unclear whether it is sufficient to explain this trend. (See <a href=\"#H334357397\" class=\"local\">'Trends in pubertal timing'</a> above.)</p><p>Leptin has been proposed as the hormone responsible for the initiation and progression of puberty. Leptin is produced largely in adipocytes; large fat cells produce more leptin than do small ones, and serum leptin concentrations are highly correlated with body fat content. The potential importance of leptin is illustrated by observations that mice or humans deficient in leptin fail to undergo pubertal development and that the administration of leptin to these animals or individuals results in pubertal onset, but only at a normal age; administration of leptin does not induce precocious puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. Furthermore, higher serum leptin concentrations in girls are associated with increased body fat and an earlier onset of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In one study, a 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> increase in serum leptin was associated with earlier menarche by one month, and a 1 kg increase in body fat was associated with earlier menarche by 13 days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-leptin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of leptin&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Leptin appears to be one of several factors that influence the activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator, probably as a signal of the availability of metabolic fuel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. One study of eight boys showed that serum leptin concentrations increased immediately before puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], but this was not observed in other studies, which have suggested that changes in serum leptin are a result of changes in body composition with puberty rather than a trigger of pubertal onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. </p><p>Overall, leptin appears to be a permissive signal that is required for normal reproductive endocrine function and puberty, but not the instructive signal that initiates the onset of puberty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1402198752\"><span class=\"h3\">Physiology of pubertal onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A critical hormonal event in puberty is an increase in the pulsatile secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus. The question, &quot;What triggers puberty?&quot; can therefore be reframed as, &quot;What triggers the increase in GnRH secretion at puberty?&quot;. These questions remain fundamentally unanswered, but research over the decades has started to shed light on this mysterious phenomenon.</p><p>Theoretically, puberty can start as the result of the emergence of activators of GnRH secretion or the suppression of inhibitors of GnRH secretion. Evidence suggests that both mechanisms are involved in the onset of puberty.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activators of GnRH secretion &ndash; Glutamate has long been known to stimulate GnRH neuronal activity in animal models, but whether glutamate is directly involved in determining pubertal timing remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Similarly, while the hormone leptin is required for normal pubertal onset in humans, it seems unlikely to play a role in determining pubertal timing, as discussed in detail above. (See <a href=\"#H457304473\" class=\"local\">'Body fat and leptin'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another stimulatory factor, kisspeptin, appears to have an important role in the initiation of puberty in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Kisspeptin is secreted by neurons in the hypothalamus and potently stimulates hypothalamic GnRH secretion. In humans, loss-of-function mutations in <em>KISS1</em>, which encodes the kisspeptin preprohormone, or in <em>KISS1R</em> (formerly <em>GPR54</em>), which encodes the kisspeptin receptor, cause lack of pubertal development due to idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Expressions of hypothalamic <em>KISS1 </em>mRNA and kisspeptin peptide appear to increase across the pubertal transition in animal models, suggesting that kisspeptin may be a key instructive signal in the initiation of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], but raises a new question: &quot;What triggers the increased expression of <em>KISS1</em> at puberty?&quot; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Signaling by neurokinin B also appears to be an important stimulus for pubertal onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In humans, mutations in <em>TAC3</em>, which encodes the neurokinin B preprohormone, and <em>TACR3</em>, which encodes the primary neurokinin B receptor, also cause idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. A unique feature of patients with mutations in <em>TAC3</em> or <em>TACR3</em> is that they have a propensity for &quot;reversal&quot; of their hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, that is, recovery of reproductive endocrine function in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Furthermore, mutations in <em>TAC3</em> and <em>TACR3</em> have been found in patients with delayed puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], and common genetic variants near <em>TACR3</em> have been found to influence the timing of normal puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that signaling by neurokinin B may have a specific role in activation of the reproductive endocrine system at the time of puberty but may have a less important role in maintaining reproductive endocrine function in adulthood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibitors of GnRH secretion &ndash; Patients with precocious puberty provide insight into potential inhibitors of GnRH secretion. It has long been recognized that lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) can cause precocious puberty (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a>). This implies that pathways within the CNS suppress GnRH neuronal activity during childhood, such that disruption of these pathways results in precocious puberty, though the precise identity of these pathways remains obscure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) appears to play an important role in these inhibitory pathways. In rhesus monkeys, secretion of GABA in the hypothalamus decreases across the pubertal transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], and pharmacological disruption of signaling through the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor induces early puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Loss-of-function mutations in the gene <em>MKRN3</em> have been found to be a genetic cause of precocious puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. <em>MKRN3</em> is maternally imprinted, ie, only the paternal allele is expressed; mutations in <em>MKRN3</em> therefore cause precocious puberty only if inherited from the father. <em>MKRN3</em> encodes makorin ring finger protein 3, a protein that may have a role in ubiquitination (addition of the protein ubiquitin to target proteins, which have yet to be identified). In mice, <em>MKRN3</em> expression decreases around the time of sexual maturation, suggesting that <em>Mkrn3</em> has a role in suppressing reproductive endocrine function prior to puberty. Mutations in <em>MKRN3</em> have been found in about one-third of familial cases of precocious puberty and about 3 percent of sporadic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>].</p><p/><p>Overall, genetic factors have been estimated to account for 50 to 75 percent of the variation in normal pubertal timing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/89-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-92</a>]. Several genetic loci have now been identified that are associated with age of pubertal onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/83,89-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,89-93</a>]. A large genome-wide study including more than 370,000 women identified common variants or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 389 genetic loci that were associated with age at menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Several of these loci have also been shown to be associated with the timing of pubertal events in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/83,92,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,92,94</a>]. </p><p>Some of the genes near these loci have known roles in reproduction, such as <em>ESR1</em>, which encodes the estrogen receptor alpha, <em>TACR3</em>, which encodes the neurokinin B receptor, and <em>MKRN3</em>, which encodes makorin ring finger protein 3. Furthermore, some of the genetic variants associated with age at menarche have also been associated with variation in adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>]. These observations suggest a genetic basis for previously observed associations between age at menarche and height; in some cases, this association might be mediated by earlier epiphyseal closure caused by earlier exposure to estrogens. Similarly, several genes that are associated with childhood obesity were also associated with earlier age at menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity#H1161052685\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic contribution and pathophysiology of obesity&quot;, section on 'Common obesity'</a>). However, it is unclear how most of the loci may regulate menarchal timing. As an example, one of the strongest associations is with <em>LIN28B </em>(<em>Caenorhabditis&nbsp;elegans,</em> homolog of B), which is a regulator of microRNA processing involved in developmental timing in <em>C. elegans</em> but whose role in human reproduction is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/83,90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,90-92</a>]. </p><p>Despite these significant advances in understanding the genetics of pubertal timing, most of the genetic basis remains unexplained, as the variants described in these studies account for only 2.7 percent of the variation in pubertal timing. Collectively, these findings provide glimpses into the physiological mechanisms that determine pubertal timing, but an integrated model for the onset of puberty remains elusive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ISSUES ARISING WITH PUBERTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puberty is associated with a number of complications that present challenges to the patient and family.

Although the underlying diagnosis usually is &quot;idiopathic pubertal gynecomastia,&quot; a variety of other etiologies including drugs, medications, hypogonadism (most notably due to Klinefelter syndrome), testicular tumors, and hyperthyroidism must be considered. The underlying mechanisms presumably reflect an imbalance in the effective estrogenic-to-androgenic stimulation because of an increase in the production or action of estrogens or estrogen-like compounds, a decrease in the production or action of androgens, or enhanced breast tissue sensitivity to estrogens or estrogen-like compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

If the opening of the comedone is widely dilated, oxidation of keratinous material leads to the development of a blackhead without inflammatory acne. With a small opening, a closed comedo (whitehead) forms and may lead to inflammatory acne if the comedo ruptures into the dermis. With pubertal maturation in both boys and girls, the number of acne lesions increases, with a greater number of comedones than inflammatory lesions at all stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. In girls, the severity of acne in later puberty is associated with higher serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and a greater number of acne lesions in early puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Although acne is common during puberty, moderate or severe acne in early puberty, usually with other signs of androgen excess, should alert the clinician to the possibility of an endocrinologic disorder, such as non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia or polycystic ovary syndrome.

As puberty progresses, boys develop a more positive self-image and mood.

In a large cross-sectional study, girls who were early-maturing and boys who were late-maturing were more likely to have psychopathology. Girls who matured early were more likely to have a lifetime history of disruptive behavior (attention-deficit, hyperactivity, oppositional, or conduct disorders) and suicide attempts, whereas boys who were late-maturing were more likely to have internalizing behaviors and emotional reliance on others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. In a separate study, higher rates of depression and antisocial behaviors among early-maturing girls persisted into early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Girls with early maturation are more likely to have older friends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>] and to be more vulnerable to peer pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. </p><p>Certain cognitive characteristics have long been observed in adolescents, in which they make very different decisions when under the influence of strong emotions (&quot;hot&quot; cognition) as compared with decisions made under conditions of low emotional arousal (&quot;cool&quot; cognition) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Adolescents may display these cognitive characteristics because the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain involved in impulse control, matures later than the remainder of the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. Thus, in times of stress, the brain of the adolescent may be less able to modulate the affective component as compared with adults. Multiple studies have documented an association between early pubertal maturation in girls and increased engagement in risk-taking behaviors. This association could be mediated by peer associations, mismatch of chronologic age and physical appearance, or other factors. In addition, studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have suggested that brain development is impacted by both pubertal stage and timing of puberty, and may provide a neurodevelopmental predilection for risk-taking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pubertal status may help predict the specific type of musculoskeletal injuries that adolescents may encounter during participation in sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. The greatest risk of damage to epiphyseal growth plates occurs during periods of peak height velocity, which also is the time of greatest change in bone mineral content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Similarly, the age of peak incidence of distal radius fractures matches the age of peak height velocity in both boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>] (see <a href=\"#H82698138\" class=\"local\">'Bone growth'</a> above). The asynchronous growth of body parts may result in a limited range of motion of some joints; when combined with the increase in muscle mass that occurs shortly after peak height velocity, the limited range of motion may lead to sprains or strains.

Girls with later onset of menarche progress more slowly to regular ovulatory cycles; when menarche occurs after the age of 13, only one-half will ovulate regularly within 4.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-puberty/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p>Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) refers to excessive, prolonged, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irregular endometrial bleeding. In adolescents, anovulation accounts for approximately 80 percent of cases of AUB. With anovulatory cycles, unopposed estrogen stimulates the endometrium, leading to a sustained proliferative phase rather than maturing to a secretory endometrium. Estrogen levels ultimately cannot sustain the hyperplastic endometrial lining, leading to irregular, sometimes heavy, menstrual bleeding.

In boys, the mean age of pubertal onset is about 11.5 years, with a range from about 9 to 13 years, with some racial variation. However, these figures may not reflect an observed trend towards earlier pubertal timing. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H334358183\" class=\"local\">'Timing of pubertal events'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical age thresholds for evaluating children for precocious puberty are signs of breast development before eight years in girls and testicular enlargement before nine years in boys. Given the increasing frequency of earlier pubertal onset, some authorities suggest that these thresholds are too high. In clinical practice, the need for clinical evaluation of girls who develop signs of puberty between six and eight years of age depends on the degree and rate of maturation. (See <a href=\"#H334357397\" class=\"local\">'Trends in pubertal timing'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual maturity ratings (Tanner stages) for pubic hair, breast, and male genitalia consist of five categories, with stage 1 representing prepuberty and stage 5 representing adult development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55329 \">table 1</a>). These stages are illustrated by the figure in boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005 \">picture 2</a>) and in girls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038%7EPEDS%2F79782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 graphicRef79782 \">picture 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Sexual maturity rating (Tanner stages)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In most girls, the earliest secondary sexual characteristic is <span class=\"nowrap\">breast/areolar</span> development (thelarche) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 \">picture 1A</a>), although about 15 percent have pubic hair as the initial manifestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79782 \">picture 1B</a>). Menarche occurs, on average, 2.6 years after the onset of puberty and 0.5 years after peak height velocity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52047\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52047 \">figure 2A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Girls'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In boys, the earliest stage of maturation is almost always an increase in testicular volume, followed by penile growth and the appearance of pubic hair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005 \">picture 2</a>). The appearance of sperm in the urine and the onset of nocturnal sperm emissions occur shortly after the attainment of peak height velocity; many consider these events the male equivalent of menarche (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72046 \">figure 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Boys'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of the growth spurt (peak height velocity) occurs approximately two years earlier in girls than in boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52047%7EPEDS%2F72046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52047 graphicRef72046 \">figure 2A-B</a>). Extremely early onset of puberty (precocious puberty) and earlier peak height velocity are associated with reduced adult height due to early epiphyseal closure. Whether pubertal onset that is early but within the normal range is associated with reduced adult stature is less clear. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Growth spurt'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States and most other developed countries, the average age of onset of puberty has declined during the past four decades. Between 5 and 12 percent of girls have menarche younger than 11 years of age; this rate varies by <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnic</span> group and weight status. (See <a href=\"#H334357397\" class=\"local\">'Trends in pubertal timing'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age at onset of puberty and the age at menarche are influenced by several factors. Genetics account for most of the variability; other factors include overall health, obesity, and possibly other environmental factors that are yet to be identified. (See <a href=\"#H457304473\" class=\"local\">'Body fat and leptin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1402198752\" class=\"local\">'Physiology of pubertal onset'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the hormonal changes that drive pubertal development are well described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98701%7EPEDS%2F98702\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98701 graphicRef98702 \">figure 1A-B</a>), the physiologic mechanisms that determine pubertal timing remain poorly understood. (See <a href=\"#H1402198752\" class=\"local\">'Physiology of pubertal onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Puberty is associated with a variety of physiologic changes which may come to medical attention, including acne and scoliosis, gynecomastia in boys, and anemia and dysfunctional uterine bleeding in girls. Psychologic and emotional changes are common, with increased rates of depression and risk-taking behaviors.
