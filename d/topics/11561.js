Surgical cricothyroidotomy and cricothyroidotomy using the Seldinger technique are discussed separately.

For the purposes of this review, definitions are as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle cricothyroidotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Needle cricothyroidotomy involves passing an over-the-needle catheter through the cricothyroid membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73518 \">figure 1</a>). This procedure provides a temporary secure airway to oxygenate and ventilate a patient in severe respiratory distress in whom less invasive techniques (eg, bag-valve-mask ventilation, laryngeal mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation) have failed or are not likely to be successful (ie, &quot;can't intubate, can't ventilate&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>Needle cricothyroidotomy may be performed on patients of any age but is considered to be preferable to surgical cricothyroidotomy in infants and children up to 10 to 12 years of age because it is anatomically easier to perform with less potential damage to the larynx and surrounding structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical cricothyroidotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical cricothyroidotomy is an emergent airway approach in which the clinician makes an incision in the cricothyroid membrane and passes a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube into the trachea. The standard, four step, and Seldinger techniques are common methods of surgical cricothyroidotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical cricothyroidotomy provides more effective ventilation than needle cricothyroidotomy because of the larger diameter tube used and is typically chosen instead of needle cricothyroidotomy in adults and children over 10 to 12 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous transtracheal ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (PTV) involves oxygenation and ventilation via a needle or surgical cricothyroidotomy using an improvised ventilation device. PTV is considered a form of conventional ventilation. However, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;jet ventilation&quot; when a high pressure source is used to deliver oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. For this topic, PTV refers to use of a bag-valve mask or wall oxygen as the delivery source. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Bag-valve-mask connector options'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen tubing connector options'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transtracheal jet ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transtracheal jet ventilation refers to high frequency, low tidal volume ventilation provided via a laryngeal catheter by specialized ventilators that are usually only available in the operating room or intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Thus, transtracheal jet ventilation is <strong>not</strong> considered a type of conventional ventilation. This procedure is occasionally employed in the operating room when a difficult airway is anticipated (eg, Treacher Collins syndrome, Robin sequence, head and neck surgery with supraglottic or glottic obstruction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H666922917\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cricothyroid membrane, as the name implies, is bound by the cricoid cartilage inferiorly and the thyroid cartilage superiorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73518 \">figure 1</a>). The key anatomic landmarks are (from cephalad to caudad): hyoid cartilage, thyroid cartilage, cricothyroid membrane, cricoid cartilage, and the tracheal rings.</p><p>In older children and adolescents, the laryngeal prominence at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage is easily felt. The thyroid cartilage can then be followed inferiorly to locate the cricothyroid membrane.</p><p>In infants and younger children, the laryngeal prominence is not developed, making it difficult to identify the thyroid cartilage. Instead, it is easier to follow the tracheal rings superiorly to locate the prominence of the cricoid cartilage. The cricothyroid membrane is located just superior to the cricoid cartilage. If the cricothyroid membrane cannot be located with certainty in an infant or a young child, percutaneous transtracheal ventilation can be safely performed by introducing the needle between the tracheal cartilages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The cricothyroid arteries and veins usually overlie the apical portion of the membrane and come from the sides, anastomosing in the midline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, needle cricothyroidotomy should be attempted in the central, lower portion of the membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73518 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In fresh adult cadavers, the size of the cricothyroid membrane was found to vary from 8 to 19 mm (mean 13.7 mm) in the vertical dimension, and from 9 to 19 mm (mean 12.4 mm) in the transverse dimension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A more recent study in the United Kingdom trauma population, using electronic calipers on 482 reformatted computed tomography scans, found the mean height to be much smaller at 8 mm in males and 6 mm in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These data suggest that catheters up to 13-gauge can be safely used in a patient with a fully developed airway. The cricothyroid membrane has a mean height of 2.6 mm (SD: 0.7) and width of 3 mm (SD: 0.6) in neonatal cadavers (mean height of 44.9 cm and a mean weight of 2 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The clinician should place the largest catheter possible using this limited information and palpation of the cricothyroid membrane as a guide. The mean depth of tissue overlying cricothyroid membrane in adults is about 2.3 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H666923073\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Needle cricothyroidotomy was originally used for passive transtracheal oxygenation in the 1950s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Eventually, needle cricothyroidotomy with percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (PTV) emerged as the invasive rescue method of choice because it provided oxygenation as well as clearance of carbon dioxide. This approach could sustain life for a longer period of time than passive transtracheal oxygenation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/1,13,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,23-25</a>]. Successful use of needle cricothyroidotomy with PTV in infants and children was first performed in the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/13,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26</a>].</p><p>Delivered tidal volume during PTV is affected by multiple factors, including inspiratory pressure, duration of inspiration, airway resistance, size of catheter, and lung compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>]. PTV is less efficient than ventilation through endotracheal intubation because up to one-third of oxygen flow delivered to the catheter tip passes up through the glottic opening and out the nose and mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. High pressure oxygen delivery systems are optimal to provide effective ventilation through the relatively narrow catheters used for PTV. However, low pressure systems (eg, self-inflating bag connected to the cricothyroidotomy catheter via a 3.0 mm internal diameter endotracheal tube adapter, 7.0 mm ID ETT adapter connected through a 3 cc syringe, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52559\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52559 \">figure 2</a>)) are sufficient in most patients if a high flow oxygen system is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/2,11,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,28,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> below.)</p><p>In adults, PTV is typically accomplished using a 50 pounds per square inch (psi) (350 kPa) oxygen source and a 13- to 16-gauge over-the-needle catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/3,24,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24,30</a>]. The catheter size (13- to 16-gauge) does not appear to substantially affect gas flow rates when using wall outlet oxygen because gas flows in a turbulent fashion under high pressure through these narrow catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Large cannula (&gt;4 mm), inserted via the Seldinger technique, enable ventilation with lower pressures in adults but require either a cuff or upper airway obstruction to prevent gas from escaping through the upper airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Lower driving pressures (25 to 35 psi [172 to 241 kPa]) are used in infants and younger children (under 12 years of age) in order to prevent barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Smaller catheters (16- to 18-gauge) are typically placed due to the anatomic limitation posed by the cricothyroid membrane in the pediatric population. (See <a href=\"#H666922917\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Once ventilation is established, exhalation through the transtracheal catheter is insufficient to prevent hyperinflation of the lungs. However, in most instances where PTV is used, the patient's airway remains sufficiently patent to permit exhalation through the nose and mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/3,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31</a>]. In situations where complete airway obstruction exists, the clinician should use longer expiratory time and lower oxygen delivery pressure. In addition, chest rise and fall with inspiration and expiration should be carefully monitored. Diminished chest fall with expiration should lead to further reduction in respiratory rate, prolongation of expiratory time, and emergent chest radiography to look for signs for pulmonary barotrauma. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Performing transtracheal ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p>PTV provides less efficient ventilation than endotracheal intubation. Because of the concern for carbon dioxide retention with PTV, the traditional approach has been to use it as a short term (eg, less than 45 minutes) temporizing airway measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, when oxygenation is well maintained, even relatively high levels of hypercarbia may be well tolerated, thus permitting its use for many hours at a time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/2,12,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,32</a>]. Regardless, the clinician should still rapidly seek to definitively secure the airway in most patients who require PTV, especially in settings complicated by increased intracranial pressure (because hypercarbia worsens intracranial pressure) or complete upper airway obstruction (increased risk of barotrauma).</p><p>There is no risk of gastric dilatation with needle cricothyroidotomy and PTV. The flow of gas up the airway aids in the expulsion of secretions, minimizing the need for suction and preventing pulmonary aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/24,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,33</a>].</p><p>Using a canine model, researchers showed that it is not necessary to induce paralysis when using PTV for emergency ventilation of a sedated patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary indication is inability to maintain the airway with noninvasive standard airway procedures (eg, bag-valve-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation) or rescue procedures (eg, laryngeal mask airway).</p><p>The typical setting involves patients with pathologic processes that cause distortion of the upper airway anatomy, for example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/3,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,35-37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway obstruction by uncontrolled bleeding into the oral cavity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe maxillofacial trauma - blunt, penetrating, or associated with mandibular fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngeal foreign body that cannot be removed expeditiously</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of upper airway structures, examples include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection, like epiglottitis or Ludwig's angina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Allergic or immunologic reaction, as from food allergy or hereditary angioedema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chemical or thermal burns to the epiglottis and upper airway</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Post-extubation glottic edema</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Absolute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Needle cricothyroidotomy with percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (PTV) is absolutely contraindicated when the airway is maintainable through noninvasive means.</p><p>In addition, needle cricothyroidotomy with PTV should <strong>not</strong> be performed when damage to the larynx, cricoid cartilage, or trachea preclude successful oxygenation and ventilation via a transtracheal catheter, for example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngeal injury with known damage to cricoid cartilage (laryngeal fracture)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheal rupture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheal transection with distal tracheal retraction into the mediastinum</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several relative contraindications arise in situations where anatomic distortion increases the risk of airway complications or where excessive bleeding may be encountered during needle cricothyroidotomy and PTV as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior neck swelling (eg, angioedema, hematoma) that obscures anatomical landmarks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic anomalies or distortion of the larynx and trachea (eg, repaired tracheal anomalies, Hurler syndrome) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Hurler syndrome'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding disorder</p><p/><p>However, in most instances, the benefit of securing an airway will outweigh the risk of performing needle cricothyroidotomy in these circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PRECAUTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete upper airway obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In routine use of percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (PTV) through a catheter, much of the expired air comes out of the mouth and nose. Thus, with complete upper airway obstruction, egress of expired air is difficult. Initial studies in animals suggested that PTV in the setting of complete upper airway obstruction led to development of massive distension of lungs, severe barotrauma, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Subsequent studies have shown successful use of PTV in settings of complete upper airway obstruction using modified techniques that consist of prolonged expiratory time, larger internal diameter catheters, and lower oxygen flow rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>PTV may be used successfully in partial laryngeal obstruction as the &quot;ball-valve&quot; effect, while constraining natural inspiration, adequately permits exhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/15,30,31,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,30,31,42</a>]. For infants and young children with complete upper airway obstruction and where other methods have been unsuccessful, it is reasonable to use PTV. Ventilatory methods should use a longer expiratory time (eg, I:E ratio of 1:8 to 1:10), lower oxygen delivery pressure and flow rate, and as large a catheter as possible. In addition, the clinician should carefully monitor for chest rise and fall with inspiration and expiration. Diminished chest fall with expiration should lead to further reduction in respiratory rate, longer expiratory time, and emergent chest radiography to look for signs of pulmonary barotrauma.

Thus, proper patient selection is essential. The key indication consists of inability to maintain a patient's airway utilizing noninvasive means (eg, bag-valve-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, laryngeal mask airway). These patients cannot be intubated and cannot be ventilated.</p><p>Proposed criteria include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to maintain adequate oxygenation with bag-valve-mask ventilation using 100 percent oxygen</p><p/><p>AND</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to place or utilize a laryngeal mask airway</p><p/><p>AND</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to endotracheally intubate (eg, three or more failed attempts or failure to intubate after 10 minutes in a patient who cannot be maintained with bag-valve-mask ventilation or other noninvasive device)</p><p/><p>Pathologic processes that cause distortion of the upper airway anatomy comprise the typical scenarios.
