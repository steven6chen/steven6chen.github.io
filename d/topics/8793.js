The degree of active or chronic changes helps determine prognosis and likelihood of response to treatment. In addition, kidney biopsy can be performed to help assess genetic diseases.</p><p>It is important to recognize that prognostication based upon renal pathology alone may be affected by the sample size (particularly in lesions that are focal in nature) and may not be very accurate in biopsies with few glomeruli (ie, &le;5). The findings in renal biopsy always need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical and laboratory features. Chronic changes (interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy), for example, are a sign of the magnitude and duration of prior injury.</p><p>The following topic review provides an overview of issues relating to percutaneous renal biopsy. Nonpercutaneous renal biopsy techniques are also discussed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine evaluation of a percutaneous renal biopsy involves examination of the tissue under light, immunofluorescence (and immunoperoxidase in some laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]), and electron microscopy. Each component of the evaluation can provide important diagnostic information (see appropriate topic reviews for discussions concerning pathologic findings in individual disorders). The routine immunofluorescence examination of biopsy specimens should include (at a minimum) evaluation of IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C1q, albumin, fibrin, and kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains. Special studies, including evaluation of serum amyloid A deposits, IgG subclasses (IgG1-4), phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), and collagen chains (alpha 3.4 and 5), may be helpful in some cases where available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thin basement membrane nephropathy (benign familial hematuria)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, pathogenesis, and pathology of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Justification for the routine application of electron microscopy comes largely from studies in the 1960s and 1970s, which showed that this technique provided substantive diagnostic information beyond that obtained from light microscopy in nearly 50 percent of cases. However, most of these studies were performed at a time when immunofluorescence microscopy was not widely available.</p><p>To assess the utility of electron microscopy, a study of 288 native renal biopsies performed over a six-month period in 1997 examined the diagnostic findings provided by light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. When viewed in combination with the results from light and immunofluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy provided:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Required diagnostic information in 50 cases &ndash; 21 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important confirmatory data in 48 &ndash; 21 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional unrelated findings in eight &ndash; 3 percent</p><p/><p>These findings are consistent with the results from earlier studies and support the continued use of routine electron microscopy. Diagnoses that commonly require electron microscopy included minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, thin basement membrane disease and Alport syndrome, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, HIV-associated nephropathy, amyloidosis, immunoglobulin deposition diseases, and fibrillary (immunotactoid) glomerulopathy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications and when biopsy may not be necessary'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND WHEN BIOPSY MAY NOT BE NECESSARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for performing a renal biopsy vary among nephrologists, determined in large part by the presenting signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/1,2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5-7</a>]. This is an important issue since the following discussion will include a number of settings in which renal biopsy is <strong>not indicated</strong>, which will avoid the potential risk of bleeding and other complications associated with renal biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>The overall rate of native kidney biopsy (in number of procedures per million population [pmp]) varies from over 250 pmp in Australia to less than 75 pmp in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The renal biopsy rate is higher in adults than in children. These differences in renal biopsy rate are not driven by differences in the spectrum of renal pathology, but rather by opinions regarding the value of the procedure in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. In many academic medical centers, biopsies of the transplanted kidney exceed those performed to diagnose disease in the native kidney. </p><p>The results of the renal biopsy impact patient care in up to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/5,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-12</a>]. However, the utility of the biopsy may differ considerably based upon the indication. Older age is not a contraindication to renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The following discussion will review the indications for renal biopsy according to the clinical presentation. A review of the causes of the major clinical patterns (eg, nephrotic and nephritic) is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated glomerular hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (ie, persistent microscopic hematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells, negative &quot;dipstick&quot; for proteinuria, normal serum creatinine concentration, and normal blood pressure), the renal biopsy may not alter therapy, as such patients generally have a good prognosis. When biopsies are performed, they typically demonstrate either a normal kidney biopsy or one of three disorders: IgA nephropathy, hereditary nephritis (Alport syndrome), or thin basement membrane disease. Most patients with IgA nephropathy and thin basement membrane disease without proteinuria have a good long-term prognosis and, other than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, there is no clear effective therapy for any of these conditions. However, some patients (such as those with Alport syndrome) may desire a histologic diagnosis for genetic counseling purposes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isolated-and-persistent-glomerular-hematuria-iga-alport-thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isolated and persistent glomerular hematuria: IgA; Alport; thin basement membrane nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a result, a renal biopsy is not routinely performed to establish a specific diagnosis, at least in the United States, unless there is coexisting proteinuria or evidence of renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a prospective study of 276 native renal biopsies, for example, biopsy for isolated hematuria changed a management decision in only 1 of 36 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>If a biopsy is not performed, ongoing follow-up to monitor for the development of proteinuria or disease progression is warranted. This is particularly true with IgA nephropathy since the majority of patients who are first seen with isolated hematuria have progressive disease (eg, development of proteinuria, hypertension, or renal insufficiency) over many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Renal biopsies are not indicated in patients with persistent nonglomerular hematuria; such patients need a thorough urologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A renal biopsy is generally <strong>not</strong> performed in a patient who presents with low-grade proteinuria (less than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> absence of glomerular hematuria, normal renal function, and an absence of clinical or serologic evidence of a systemic disease that can cause glomerulonephritis (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, or a paraproteinemia) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;</a>). Some of these patients will have mild primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, or membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; however, immunosuppressive therapy would not be indicated in this setting, since the prognosis with non-nephrotic proteinuria is often excellent. Other patients will have secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis as a response to ischemic injury (as in nephrosclerosis) or to nephron loss (as in reflux nephropathy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many nephrologists routinely perform a renal biopsy in patients with somewhat higher degrees of non-nephrotic proteinuria (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> except in the setting where this may be explained by conditions, such as longstanding diabetes mellitus or hypertension. If such a patient is reluctant to undergo biopsy, indications for further encouragement of the patient to consent to the procedure include increasing proteinuria or serum creatinine concentrations, or the new onset of hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephrotic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal biopsy is performed in most adults and older children with apparently idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (ie, no apparent underlying disease). In this setting, it is likely that one of the three major causes of the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is present: minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or membranous nephropathy. The findings on renal biopsy frequently influence therapy in older children and adults. In one report, for example, renal biopsy for nephrotic syndrome in adults influenced the management decision in 86 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This is due in part to the presence of an unexpected diagnosis, such as primary (AL) amyloidosis, fibrillary (immunotactoid) glomerulonephritis, or membranous nephropathy with signs of underlying lupus that may occur in the absence of the typical serologic changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Renal biopsy is also often indicated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus since a proliferative glomerulonephritis may also be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for renal biopsy in patients with lupus nephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to these indications, there are a variety of patients with the nephrotic syndrome in whom renal biopsy is usually <strong>not</strong> performed at diagnosis. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with diabetes mellitus for many years in whom the initial manifestation is moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called microalbuminuria) that slowly progresses to overt proteinuria over many years. However, nondiabetic renal disease can occur and there are a variety of clinical clues that suggest nondiabetic disease. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Nondiabetic renal disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with nephrotic syndrome that seems, from the history and presence of extrarenal involvement, to be due to primary or secondary amyloidosis, which can be diagnosed by less invasive tissue biopsy (such as abdominal fat pad or rectal biopsy).

However, there are situations in which the initiation of therapy is required while awaiting the renal biopsy. Examples include microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or anti-GBM antibody disease. These are disorders that are associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and, in the appropriate clinical setting, are suggested serologically by the presence of circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) or anti-GBM antibodies.

Patients with acute renal insufficiency and an active urine sediment may have any number of lesions and require a renal biopsy to establish a diagnosis, determine prognosis, and guide therapy. A repeat biopsy may also be performed for late progression of the disease to distinguish between active lupus (which may require immunosuppressive therapy) and scarring of previous inflammatory injury (which may warrant antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Resolution of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is usually rapid if there is resolution of the infection. A diuresis typically begins within one week and the serum creatinine returns to the previous baseline in three to four weeks. Other causes of glomerulonephritis should be considered and renal biopsy performed if there are recurrent episodes of hematuria, which is suggestive of IgA nephropathy, persistent hypocomplementemia at six weeks after appropriate therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a progressive increase in serum creatinine.

A position paper from the college of American Pathologists and American Society of Clinical Pathologists reported that the bleeding time lacked clinical benefit to predict surgical bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, extrapolation of the use of the bleeding time for an open surgical procedure, in which direct hemostasis can be achieved, to a closed procedure, such as the percutaneous renal biopsy, is unclear. This is an important issue because patients with chronic kidney disease may have an elevated bleeding time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] and, therefore, the bleeding time may be of value in this population. Although there are no randomized prospective studies evaluating the use of the bleeding time in the setting of a percutaneous renal biopsy, observational studies have demonstrated a bleeding complication rate that is three to five times higher in those patients with abnormal bleeding times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. In a large cohort of more than 1000 biopsies, for example, minor complications (eg, gross hematuria, perinephric hematoma) occurred in 8.1 percent, and major complications (eg, need for a blood transfusion or other intervention) occurred in 6.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, patients with a bleeding time longer than 7.5 minutes had higher rates of minor and major complications (10.1 and 9.4 percent, respectively). Other series, however, report no increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/18,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27</a>].

A full discussion of the relevant issues is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following is a general guide concerning the management of such patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> to allow the INR to drift below 1.5, or reverse it with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> if the biopsy must be performed urgently. Whether heparin is required prior to the biopsy once the INR falls below 2, and after the biopsy until oral anticoagulation is restarted, depends upon the perceived risk of thrombosis or embolism (eg, type of event, and frequency and remoteness of prior events). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'Estimating thromboembolic risk'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require intravenous heparin, it should be stopped for at least six hours pre-biopsy to allow the PTT to normalize, and if possible, should not be resumed for at least 12 to 24 hours. In our opinion, withholding heparin for a more prolonged period of up to one week is preferred, unless the thrombotic risk outweighs the bleeding risk. Although most clinically significant bleeding is recognized in the first 12 to 24 hours post-biopsy, bleeding may occur up to several days after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

A surgically performed, open renal biopsy has been the procedure of choice in this setting.</p><p>Percutaneous renal biopsy of a solitary kidney has been performed successfully in a few selected cases, and it has been suggested that the risk of surgery and nephrectomy with percutaneous biopsy is, as noted below, so low that it may be less than the risk of general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/1,32,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32,44,45</a>]. We therefore agree that having a solitary kidney is not an absolute contraindication to undergoing percutaneous kidney biopsy. However, the experience with this practice is too limited to recommend it safely for widespread practice. Thus, we recommend the use of nonpercutaneous techniques in patients with solitary kidneys who require biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Nonpercutaneous renal biopsy techniques'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should provide informed consent for the biopsy. Possible allergy to local anesthetics and iodine containing solutions should be elicited. Just prior to the procedure, peripheral intravenous access is placed and the patient is usually placed prone with a pillow under the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. If the patient is pregnant or very obese, the biopsy can be performed in the seated, lateral decubitus, or supine anterolateral position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/37,38,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,46</a>]. Some anxious patients may require mild sedation, but when prescribing sedatives, caution should be taken and side effects considered.</p><p>Percutaneous renal biopsy is usually performed under ultrasonic guidance with local anesthesia (usually 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> hydrochloride) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. Ultrasonography can localize the desired lower pole site (at which the risk of puncturing a major vessel is minimized), determine renal size, and detect the unexpected presence of cysts that might necessitate using the contralateral kidney.</p><p>After the lower pole is localized, a skin mark is made to identify where the biopsy needle will be inserted. The site is subsequently prepped and anesthetized. Under ultrasound guidance, a spinal needle is then used to locate the capsule of the lower pole and to provide anesthesia for the biopsy needle tract.</p><p>After a small skin incision is made to facilitate passage, real-time ultrasonography is most commonly used to guide the biopsy needle directly into the lower pole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/16,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,47</a>]. This somewhat more cumbersome procedure has the advantage of direct visualization of the location of the needle as the core of tissue is obtained.</p><p>The use of real-time ultrasound has been compared to the &quot;blind&quot; approach (using ultrasound for localization only). A retrospective study demonstrated a higher diagnostic yield (100 percent versus 84 percent) as well as a lower major hemorrhagic complication rate (0 percent versus 11 percent) in the group using real-time ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A second retrospective study in 2138 patients reported similar findings; diagnostic yield was higher with ultrasound guidance, and the rate of major complications was lower (2.1 versus 6.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. We therefore suggest the use of real-time ultrasonography rather than ultrasonography for localization only.</p><p>A CT scan is an alternative when the kidneys cannot be well visualized, as with marked obesity or small echogenic kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A variety of different biopsy needles are available, including manual needles (TruCut disposable, Franklin-Silverman, Vim-Silverman) and automated spring-loaded biopsy needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/1,2,4,47,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,47,50-52</a>]. The choice of biopsy needle is largely one of individual preference.</p><p>Several studies have compared the adequacy and safety of different needle gauges and types. The automated needles and larger gauge needles (14 and 16 gauge compared as compared with 18 gauge) have provided more glomeruli per core and per biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/50,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,53-55</a>]. There is no difference in complication rate between a manual needle and an automatic needle of the same gauge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Two different prospective single-center studies have reported no difference in frequency of complications or number of glomeruli obtained between automated needles of 14 gauge compared with 16 gauge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/27,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,56</a>]. In addition, a nationwide registry study in Norway of 9288 biopsies revealed no difference in complications between 14 and 16 gauge needles, although there was a higher rate of complications with 18 gauge needles. In addition, there were more glomeruli per biopsy with use of either of the larger needles (14 or 16 gauge) as compared with 18 gauge needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, a meta-analysis of 34 retrospective (n = 21) and prospective (n = 13) studies, including 9474 biopsies, revealed an increased need for erythrocyte transfusion in studies using a 14 gauge as compared with either 16 or 18 gauge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>In patients with kidney transplants, a prospective randomized study evaluated automated needles of varying sizes: 14 gauge, 16 gauge, and 18 gauge. The diagnostic yield was the greatest with the 14 gauge needle.

However, the quantity of tissue required varies with the likely diagnosis. As an example, the distinction of focal (arbitrarily defined as fewer than 50 percent of glomeruli affected on light microscopy) from diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis may require up to 100 glomeruli to make the diagnosis with a reasonable degree of statistical certainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; obtaining this quantity of renal tissue is rare with percutaneous biopsy and sampling error may therefore explain the seeming variability in clinical outcome in patients with focal disease.

A large core or wedge of renal cortex can usually be obtained, the incidence of severe bleeding is very low, and mortality is rare. Other relatively minor postoperative complications can occur, including fever, atelectasis, and ileus. In addition, an open biopsy under general anesthesia is associated with a longer hospital stay and a larger surgical scar.</p><p>Open renal biopsy has also been suggested in intensive care unit patients who are being mechanically ventilated. Even in this setting, however, it is possible to perform a percutaneous renal biopsy with portable ultrasonic guidance and the patient prone and being ventilated manually with an ambu bag [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic renal biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic renal biopsy is advocated by some investigators as a viable alternative to open renal biopsy among patients unable or unwilling to undergo percutaneous renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>].

The routine evaluation of a percutaneous renal biopsy involves examination of the tissue under light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for performing a renal biopsy vary among nephrologists, being determined in part by the presenting signs and symptoms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among patients with the nephrotic syndrome, a biopsy is usually performed in those with lupus nephritis to determine the type of disease that is present. We also usually perform a biopsy in patients with the nephrotic syndrome and no evidence of systemic disease both to determine treatment and to occasionally make an unexpected diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The acute nephritic syndrome is often caused by a systemic disease that requires a renal biopsy to establish the diagnosis and guide treatment. Even in the absence of a systemic disease, the acute nephritic syndrome often requires a biopsy to ascertain a diagnosis and direct treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among patients with unexplained acute renal failure, a biopsy is indicated in those settings in which the diagnosis is uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with isolated glomerular hematuria, a renal biopsy is <strong>not</strong> routinely performed to establish a specific diagnosis, at least in the United States, unless there is evidence of progressive disease such as increasing proteinuria or a rising serum creatinine concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A renal biopsy is also generally <strong>not</strong> performed in a patient who presents with low-grade proteinuria (less than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> the absence of glomerular hematuria, usually normal renal function, and an absence of clinical or serologic evidence of a systemic disease that can cause glomerulonephritis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications and when biopsy may not be necessary'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to a percutaneous renal biopsy, a history, physical examination, and selected laboratory tests should be performed. Recommended laboratory tests include a complete biochemical profile, complete blood count, platelet count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and bleeding time, if available. There are a number of relative contraindications to the performance of a percutaneous renal biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pre-biopsy evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Relative contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous renal biopsy is usually performed under ultrasonic guidance with local anesthesia. We suggest the use of real-time ultrasonography rather than the blind approach in which ultrasound is used for localization only (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). To optimize safety, adequacy, and patient comfort, we recommend the use of a spring-loaded needle for native kidney biopsies rather than a manual needle (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For native kidney biopsies, we usually use a 14 or 16 gauge spring-loaded needle and try to obtain two cores of renal tissue. Bleeding is the primary complication of renal biopsy.

(See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Post-procedure observation and timing of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpercutaneous renal biopsies are indicated in settings in which a percutaneous renal biopsy cannot be performed.
