However, these signs also occur in many common disorders such as sepsis, organ failure, and metabolic dysfunction. If these latter conditions can be excluded, hypotonia probably is caused by a primary neuromuscular disorder.</p><p>Assessment of the infant with hypotonia and weakness is reviewed here. The causes of hypotonia and weakness caused by peripheral nerve and muscle diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66572 \">table 1</a>) and the evaluation of specific neuromuscular disorders are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disorders-causing-hypotonia-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve and muscle disorders causing hypotonia in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The obstetric and perinatal history may provide information that supports the diagnosis of a neuromuscular disorder. Affected infants frequently have a history of polyhydramnios (caused by decreased fetal swallowing), fetal akinesia (paucity of movement), and malpresentation (often in the breech position).</p><p>Delivery may be complicated by birth trauma or perinatal depression. Although these complications can occur in normal infants, infants with congenital neuromuscular disorders may be less able to tolerate the stress associated with labor and delivery and, thus, be more susceptible to birth depression.</p><p>A family history of neuromuscular abnormalities may be informative because many disorders are inherited. Examples of familial neuromuscular diseases are congenital myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, metabolic disorders (eg, mitochondrial disease, acid maltase deficiency, defects of creatine synthesis), and familial dysautonomia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination begins with an assessment of the infant's general health. Dysmorphic features and congenital defects should be identified. Weight, length, and head circumference should be measured and the data obtained plotted against standard measurements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: General principles and standard measurements&quot;, section on 'Standard measurements'</a>.)</p><p>Certain physical findings may be helpful in making the diagnosis of a specific neuromuscular disorder. These findings, and examples of specific conditions, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin pallor, bruising, petechiae, or evidence of trauma (eg, traumatic myelopathy).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the infant with atypical genitalia (disorder of sex development)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Defects in cholesterol biochemistry'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contractures or laxity of the hips or other joints (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disorders-causing-hypotonia-in-the-newborn#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve and muscle disorders causing hypotonia in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete neurologic examination should be performed with particular attention given to the extent of hypotonia and weakness and the possible presence of other findings that may indicate a specific disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-with-hypotonia-and-weakness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-examination-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic examination of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The assessment should include the infant's posture and level of alertness. Spontaneous activity should be observed, noting whether limb movement is greater proximally or distally and opposes gravity (eg, lifting an extremity).</p><p>Eye movements are assessed as part of the cranial nerve examination. Spontaneous movements, such as fixation on objects and following them, can be observed in response to the examiner's face or a red ball. Eye movements also can be induced by gentle rotation of the head (oculocephalogyric reflex). Absent fixation or following with a positive oculocephalogyric reflex suggests a lesion above the level of the brainstem.</p><p>Facial diplegia occurs in some neuromuscular disorders (eg, congenital myotonic dystrophy). It also can be associated with severe acute basal ganglia damage (eg, mitochondrial disease, Leigh disease). The infant's ability to suck and swallow should be assessed; difficulty with swallowing may lead to pooling of secretions.</p><p>The character of the cry should be noted, and the tongue should be examined for fasciculations, which typically are associated with spinal muscular atrophy. However, they also are seen with hypoglossal motor nerve damage that occurs in conditions including glycogen storage diseases, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and infantile neuronal degeneration.</p><p>The degree of hypotonia should be evaluated (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of muscle tone'</a> below). Passive movement of the joints is done to test the power and tone of the extremities. Tone also is evaluated by the resistance to gentle shaking of an arm or leg (eg, passive response). Spontaneous fisting or an abnormal primitive reflex in response to handling may suggest cerebral dysfunction.</p><p>Deep tendon reflexes may help distinguish between upper and lower motor neuron lesions. Abnormally brisk reflexes with clonus suggest involvement of the upper tract, whereas absent reflexes are consistent with a neuropathic lesion or severe myopathy. Primary neonatal reflexes, including the Moro reflex, tonic neck response, palmar grasp, and placing and stepping reactions, should be evaluated.</p><p>Sensation should be tested by the withdrawal to a stimulus such as touching the patient with a small brush. Abnormalities in sensation associated with neonatal hypotonia can result from conditions such as hereditary sensory neuropathy (eg, familial dysautonomia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-with-hypotonia-and-weakness/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF MUSCLE TONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of muscle tone is performed as part of the complete physical examination (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: Back, extremities, nervous system, skin, and lymph nodes&quot;, section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>). The patient with hypotonia is distinguished readily from an infant with normal muscle tone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal muscle tone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the normal term infant, both the upper and lower limbs have predominantly flexor tone. Normal posture in the supine position includes flexion of the hips at approximately 70&ordm; to 90&ordm; and abduction at 10&ordm; to 20&ordm;, and the child has active movement of the limbs. Maneuvers to test muscle tone and normal responses include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Holding the infant under the arms &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">He/she</span> will assume a sitting position; truncal resistance allows the infant to be easily supported without slipping through the examiner's hands</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Holding the infant in horizontal suspension &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">He/she</span> flexes the limbs, straightens the back, and maintains the head in the midline for a few seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passive extension of the legs at the knees &ndash; Resistance is met at approximately 90&ordm;.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulling the infant from the supine to sitting position &ndash; Only a slight head lag is expected; the head should wobble in the midline for a few seconds when the sitting position is reached.</p><p/><p>Normal muscle tone is decreased in preterm compared with term infants. Flexor tone in preterm infants diminishes with decreasing gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-with-hypotonia-and-weakness/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

Spontaneous activity is decreased. The resistance of muscles to stretch is decreased, as illustrated by the following movements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Holding the infant under the arms &ndash; the legs will be extended; decreased tone of the shoulder girdle allows the infant to slip through the examiner's hands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Holding the infant in horizontal suspension &ndash; the back hangs over the examiner's hand, and the limbs and head hang loosely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passive extension of the legs at the knees &ndash; no resistance is met.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulling the infant from the supine to sitting position &ndash; the head lags and continues to lag when the sitting position is reached.</p><p/><p>These maneuvers should not be performed when cervical spine injury is present or the infant is in severe distress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinguishing among disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative changes in tone, muscle strength, and antigravity activity may help distinguish among neuromuscular disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66572 \">table 1</a>). In general, in a central nervous system disorder (eg, Leigh syndrome), tone is reduced relatively more than muscle strength, and the limbs retain antigravity power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-with-hypotonia-and-weakness/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, absent, or extremely reduced antigravity movements can be reliable indicators of a neuromuscular disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-infant-with-hypotonia-and-weakness/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, numerous exceptions occur as illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some disorders that are primarily central may present with both profound hypotonia and weakness.
