The following causes are due to either end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or treatment with hemodialysis: uremic encephalopathy, dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome (DDS), intradialytic hemodynamic instability, aluminum-associated dialysis dementia, air embolism, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia.</p><p>Other causes of seizures among hemodialysis patients are similar to the general population but may be more common among hemodialysis patients. Cerebrovascular disease (infarction, hemorrhage and subdural hematoma) is of particular concern in the hemodialysis population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;, section on 'Causes of seizure'</a>.)</p><p>Compared with nondialysis patients, hemodialysis patients are more vulnerable to drug-induced seizures with certain drugs such as carbapenem and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a> because of their markedly decreased clearance.</p><p>The following paragraphs discuss the more common causes of seizures that are specific for the dialysis population. Some are independent of dialysis, whereas others are a direct complication of the procedure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uremic encephalopathy &ndash;</strong> Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction is observed among patients with severe, untreated uremia but generally not among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis unless patients miss multiple treatments. Symptoms range from irritability and restlessness to seizures, coma, and death. Seizures are most often generalized and occur prior to dialysis, often provoking initiation of emergent dialysis. CNS dysfunction abates within days to weeks after the initiation of adequate renal replacement therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome &ndash;</strong> DDS may be observed among severely uremic patients who undergo hemodialysis for the first time but generally does not occur among patients who are on maintenance hemodialysis. DDS is characterized by neurologic symptoms of varying severity. Typically, symptoms develop during or immediately after hemodialysis. Early findings include headache, nausea, disorientation, restlessness, blurred vision, and asterixis. More severely affected patients progress to confusion, seizures, coma, and even death. However, DDS also includes many milder signs and symptoms associated with dialysis, such as muscle cramps and dizziness that develop near the end of a dialysis treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-undergoing-hemodialysis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Other predisposing factors include severe metabolic acidosis, older age, and the presence of other CNS disease, such as a pre-existing seizure disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-undergoing-hemodialysis/abstract/2,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents &ndash;</strong> A rapid rise in blood pressure due to the administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may result in hypertensive encephalopathy accompanied by seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-undergoing-hemodialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The reported incidence ranges from 2 to 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-undergoing-hemodialysis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, most studies that have reported on seizure incidence are from the early 1990s, when ESA doses and hemoglobin targets were higher than are typically used today.

A 2004 meta-analysis showed no increase in the incidence of seizures among patients treated with an ESA compared with those not treated with an ESA; however, studies included both predialysis and dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, which may have resulted in an underestimate of incidence among dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-in-patients-undergoing-hemodialysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is little evidence of increased incidence of seizures in normotensive patients treated with an ESA.

When these drugs are utilized in the hemodialysis patient population, the patient should receive additional medication immediately following hemodialysis to prevent subtherapeutic blood levels. An alternative approach is to time the doses such that the medication is given at the end of each dialysis treatment.
