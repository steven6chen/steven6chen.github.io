Nail psoriasis results from psoriatic involvement of the nail bed or nail matrix. </p><p>Patients with nail psoriasis can develop a wide variety of nail changes, such as pitting, onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, and nail discoloration. Patients may find the appearance of psoriatic nails psychologically distressing, and extensive cases may confer significant morbidity and functional impairments. Therefore, managing nail psoriasis is an integral part of psoriasis therapy.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of nail psoriasis will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and treatment of other manifestations of psoriasis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psoriasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058810432\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nail psoriasis occurs in both adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The prevalence of nail psoriasis among patients with psoriasis is estimated to be 10 and 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In most patients, nail involvement follows or is concurrent with the onset of cutaneous psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Occasionally, nail psoriasis is the sole manifestation of psoriasis at the time of clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Nail psoriasis is also strongly associated with psoriatic arthritis. It has been estimated that 80 to 90 percent of patients with psoriatic arthritis develop nail involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This finding may be related to the proximity of the nail to the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, a site of predilection of psoriatic arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79872\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79872 \">picture 1A</a>). The enthesis of extensor tendon crossing the DIP joint is linked to the nail root and nail matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some studies suggest that psoriatic arthritis is more tightly associated with psoriatic nail involvement than cutaneous psoriasis alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, not all studies have corroborated this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058810438\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nail psoriasis results from psoriatic inflammation involving the nail matrix or nail bed. The nail matrix is responsible for the formation of the nail plate and is located primarily beneath the proximal nail fold, with the distal one-third visible as the lunula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85578\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85578 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85616 \">figure 1</a>). The proximal nail matrix forms the superficial portion of the nail plate. More distal portions of the nail matrix (intermediate and ventral portions) form the deeper portion of the nail plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85617 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The nail bed lies directly beneath the nail plate and extends from the distal end of the lunula to the hyponychium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85578\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85578 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85616 \">figure 1</a>). The nail bed contributes epithelial cells to the ventral portion of the nail plate and plays an important role in the adherence of the nail plate to the nail bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Nail anatomy and physiology is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nail-disorders#H176463643\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nail disorders&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and physiology of the nail unit'</a>.)</p><p>The site of psoriasis in the nail apparatus leads to specific effects on nail formation and determines the clinical manifestations.

The HLA-Cw6 allele is strongly associated with cutaneous psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, psoriatic nail disease may align closer to dysregulation in innate immunity. Therefore, psoriatic nail disease may have a different contribution from innate immunity and adaptive immunity compared with skin-limited disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058810444\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nail psoriasis may present with involvement of a single nail, multiple nails, both fingernails and toenails, fingernails only, or toenails only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In addition, nails affected by nail psoriasis may be predisposed to secondary fungal infection. A nail plate clipping for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, or fungal culture is usually performed to assess the possibility of primary or secondary onychomycosis.

Other manifestations, such as nail pitting, oil drop discoloration, and onycholysis, are more common in nail psoriasis than in onychomycosis. A periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain on a nail clipping, fungal culture, or potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can identify onychomycosis. Of note, secondary fungal infection can occur in a psoriatic nail.

To identify the NAPSI score, individual nails are divided into four quadrants and each quadrant is assigned a score of 1 for the presence of signs of nail matrix psoriasis and a score of 1 for the presence of signs of nail bed psoriasis. Therefore, the maximum total NAPSI score per nail is 8, and the maximum total score for all nails is 160. Alternatively, each quadrant of a single target nail can be assessed.</p><p>A modified version of the NAPSI has also been validated and used for assessment of a single target nail.

Data from two similar phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of apremilast for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2) indicate that apremilast also improves nail psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-psoriasis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In the trials, a total of 1255 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomly assigned to either apremilast (30 mg twice daily) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Approximately two-thirds of the trial patients had associated nail psoriasis. At week 16, a 23 percent reduction in the mean target nail NAPSI score was detected in the apremilast group in ESTEEM 1 compared with a 7 percent increase in the placebo group. In ESTEEM 2, there were 29 and 7 percent mean reductions in target nail NAPSI scores in the apremilast and placebo groups at 16 weeks, respectively. A limitation of the trials is that baseline randomization was not stratified for nail psoriasis.

Nail psoriasis is common in patients with psoriatic arthritis or cutaneous psoriasis. Proximity to the distal interphalangeal joint may contribute to the relationship between nail psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H1058810432\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1058810438\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The location of psoriasis in the nail apparatus influences the clinical presentation. Psoriasis involving the nail matrix results in pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, or nail plate crumbling. Nail bed involvement results in oil drop discoloration, onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, or splinter hemorrhages. (See <a href=\"#H1058810444\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of nail psoriasis can usually be made based upon recognition of the characteristic clinical features, particularly if concomitant psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis is present. Onychomycosis can closely resemble nail psoriasis and an evaluation for fungal infection is often necessary. Of note, psoriatic nails may develop concomitant fungal infection. (See <a href=\"#H1058810462\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of nail psoriasis influences the approach to treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102334\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102334 \">algorithm 1</a>). For patients with mild nail psoriasis (psoriasis limited to two or fewer nails without significant symptoms or functional impairment) we recommend topical therapy, rather than systemic therapy, as initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We typically prescribe combination therapy with a high-potency topical corticosteroid and topical vitamin D analog (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcipotriol-calcipotriene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcipotriol</a>). Monotherapy with a high-potency topical corticosteroid and monotherapy with a topical vitamin D analog are alternative first-line treatments. (See <a href=\"#H1058810475\" class=\"local\">'Mild nail psoriasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (nail psoriasis associated with marked nail dystrophy involving more than two nails, significant symptoms, or functional impairment) often require systemic therapy to achieve satisfactory improvement. For these patients, we suggest treatment with a biologic TNF-alpha inhibitor or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>).
