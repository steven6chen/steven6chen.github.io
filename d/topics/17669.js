The eighth edition of the tumor, node, metastases (TNM) staging system, stage IV has now become harmonized with the one previously proposed by the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT), given its superior prognostic stratification with the restriction of stage IV tumors to those having distant metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110639 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83901 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of adrenocortical tumors&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>A modification has been proposed for the ENSAT staging system that incorporates histologic grade of differentiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F86178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86178 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one report, incorporating patient age (&gt;55 years) into available staging systems appeared to better predict overall survival in patients with stage I and II ACC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For patients with potentially resectable stage I to III disease who are surgical candidates, we recommend complete surgical resection as initial therapy.</p><p>Before proceeding to a surgical excision, all patients must undergo a complete hormonal assessment to determine the secretory activity of the tumor. It is particularly important to identify those with cortisol-producing tumors. These patients, even those with mild hypercortisolism, have some degree of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and require glucocorticoid coverage to prevent postoperative adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of adrenocortical tumors&quot;, section on 'Hormonal evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The surgery should be performed in a specialized referral center by teams of surgeons with specific expertise to avoid tumor spillage and incomplete resection, which is associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H581131967\" class=\"local\">'Stage and margin status'</a> below.)</p><p>The preoperative preparation for and techniques of surgical adrenalectomy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenalectomy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenalectomy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For potentially resectable tumors invading adjacent organs, surgery often needs to be extensive, with en bloc resection of involved organs such as kidney, liver, spleen, pancreas, stomach, and colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Intracaval extension or tumor thrombus is not a contraindication to surgery; resection may be facilitated by cardiopulmonary bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Suspicious lymph nodes should be resected, but the benefit of routine lymphadenectomy has not yet been established. ACCs often spread via lymphatic drainage. A benefit for routine lymphadenectomy during adrenalectomy was suggested in a report from the German ACC Study Group of 283 patients with completely resected ACC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There was a significantly reduced risk for tumor recurrence and disease-related death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-0.99) in patients who underwent lymphadenectomy versus those who did not. In a second study, peritumoral lymph node resection was associated with improved overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Although resection is technically possible for most patients with stage I to III disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110639 \">table 1</a>), it is not curative for many, presumably because occult micrometastases are present at the time of initial presentation, even with stage I disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. As an example, in a single center report of 202 consecutive cases of ACC, 40 percent of patients with stage I to III disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110639 \">table 1</a>) had developed distant metastasis two years after diagnosis (27, 46, and 63 percent of patients with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>However, there is some evidence that outcomes are improving over time. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Even if the tumor cannot be removed entirely, some clinicians advocate maximal debulking as a means of improving survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/11,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17-20</a>], although others disagree as to the survival benefit of this strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Data to support routine debulking of nonresectable tumors are lacking, and decision making must be individualized, taking into account the underlying tumor biology, rate of progression, and the histologic grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For patients with advanced functioning tumors, debulking may help to control hormone hypersecretion and increase the efficacy of further therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/3,6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,23</a>]. Overall, however, patients with unresectable disease have a poor prognosis, particularly with high-grade disease, often surviving only three to nine months, and they are often better palliated with medical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent or advanced adrenocortical cancer'</a> below.)</p><p>The role of neoadjuvant systemic therapy prior to surgery for patients with locally advanced disease is not defined, and this is not considered a standard approach. The value of neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is being addressed in a clinical trial from the Children's Oncology Group that is enrolling individuals up to age 21 years with ACC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In adults, one retrospective study suggested that patients with locoregionally advanced tumors might benefit from cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, definitive evidence is still lacking, and therapeutic decisions should be individualized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4164554\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic versus open resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest open rather than laparoscopic adrenalectomy for patients with ACC. Laparoscopic surgery has largely replaced the open technique for management of benign adrenal pathology, and laparoscopic removal of even large adrenal tumors can be performed safely by experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenalectomy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenalectomy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the role of laparoscopic resection for ACCs is controversial, and open surgery remains the standard approach at least in our centers, despite the European clinical practice guideline on adrenal incidentaloma, which recommends laparoscopic resection for tumors less than 6 cm even when ACC is suspected in the absence of local tumor invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Several retrospective studies have shown more frequent or earlier recurrences and a shorter disease-free survival when this technique is used for management of ACC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/5,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31-33</a>]. This is not a universal finding, however, and others have shown comparable outcomes from laparoscopic and open adrenalectomy, particularly for tumors up to 10 cm in size in specialized centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. Nonetheless, this is not a widely accepted approach, and we and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] suggest open rather than laparoscopic resection for known or highly suspected ACC, regardless of size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/5,31,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31,39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581131945\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognostic factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581131967\"><span class=\"h4\">Stage and margin status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important clinical factors that determine prognosis of ACC are disease stage and completeness of resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/12,16,17,24,41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,17,24,41-44</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of adrenocortical tumors&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>). In the previously cited series of 253 patients from the French Association of Endocrine Surgeons Study Group, five-year overall survival was 66, 58, 24, and 0 percent for stage I, II, III, and IV (metastatic) disease, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>However, survival differs widely for any given tumor stage, and many other factors influence outcomes. Regardless of stage, incomplete resection is associated with a poor prognosis (median survival generally less than one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The influence of margin status on prognosis was shown in a report from the National Cancer Database, in which five-year overall survival rates for patients with ACC and uninvolved, microscopically involved, and macroscopically involved margins were 46, 21, and 10 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581132236\"><span class=\"h4\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to stage and completeness of resection, the biologic behavior of ACCs is also influenced by <span class=\"nowrap\">pathologic/morphologic</span> factors. Histologically, the appearance of ACCs ranges from mild atypia to wildly anaplastic tumors composed of monstrous giant cells. The widely applied multifactorial scoring system of Weiss is based upon nine histopathologic features (nuclear grade, mitotic rate, atypical mitoses, clear cell component, diffuse architecture, tumor necrosis, invasion of venous or sinus structures, or tumor capsule); tumors with less than three features are usually considered as benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of adrenocortical tumors&quot;, section on 'Fine-needle aspiration biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>These criteria have been validated as prognostic factors in more contemporary series both in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/12,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,43,44</a>]. As an example, in one study of 124 patients with ACC, significant predictors of disease progression included distant metastasis at presentation; tumor invasion of vessels, tumor capsule, or adjacent organs; tumor necrosis; a high mitotic rate; the presence of atypical mitosis; and overexpression of mdm-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Five-year disease-free survival was significantly different for patients with one or two, three or four, or more than four adverse features (84, 37, and 9 percent, respectively).</p><p>Several studies confirm the prognostic value of markers of proliferation, including mitotic rate, and Ki67 expression (as detected by a monoclonal antibody against Ki67, MIB1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/12,47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,47-51</a>]. The importance of proliferative rate in prognostication was shown in an analysis of 124 patients with ACC, in whom the five-year disease-specific survival rates for individuals with tumor mitotic rates of &le;5, 6 to 10, 21 to 50, and &gt;50 per 50 high-power fields [HPF] were 63, 50, 25, and 0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The combined utility of tumor stage and mitotic rate to assess prognosis was addressed in a study of 92 patients with malignant ACC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Three risk groups were identified (low [stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II,</span> mitoses <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;9/50</span> HPF], intermediate [stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> plus &gt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mitoses/50</span> HPF or stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> plus mitotic rate <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;9/50</span> HPF], and high [stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> and mitotic rate <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;9/50</span> HPF]) that had significantly different rates of mean disease-free survival (62, 17, and 12 months, respectively) and overall survival (not attained, 66, and 26 months, respectively).</p><p>The Ki67 labeling index (LI) has been used to select patients for adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a>. While the absolute value of Ki67 LI that permits the differentiation of a &quot;high-risk&quot; from low- or intermediate-risk ACC is not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/4,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,52</a>], a high-grade ACC, which is defined in part by a high mitotic rate <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> Ki67 score &gt;20 percent), is at a higher risk of recurrence than a low-grade ACC.

The distribution by stage was as follows: stage I, 16; stage II, 126; stage III (locoregionally advanced disease), 57; stage IV (distant metastases only), 54 patients. Potentially curative surgery was performed in 182 (72 percent), and postoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> was administered to 135 (54 percent) patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Five-year survival rates were 38 percent overall and 50 percent in the curatively treated group.

Despite no significant difference in the numbers of patients undergoing potentially curative surgery, outcomes were significantly better among those treated after 1988.</p><p/><p>The reasons for the improved outcomes from treatment of ACC over time are not clear. Although the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> increased over the 20-year time period, this had a significant impact on prognosis in multivariate analysis only for those patients who did not undergo potentially curative resection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">ACC IN CHILDREN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis in children who have adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) appears to be better than that of adults, at least for early-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/42,182-186\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,182-186</a>]. In a series of 228 individuals with ACC under the age of 20 years, the estimated five-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 54 percent overall; for those with stage I or II disease, it was 91 and 53 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Stage I disease (completely excised nonmetastatic tumors &le;200 g), presenting signs of virilization alone, and age less than three years were all associated with significantly better survival, while the prognosis was poor for patients with metastatic or residual disease or larger resected tumors (weighing more than 200 grams).</p><p>Similar results were seen in an analysis of 85 patients with ACC under age 20 years reported to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1973 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/187\" class=\"abstract_t\">187</a>]. Younger patients (&le;4 years old) were more likely to have favorable features than older patients (4 to 19 years), including local disease (76 versus 31 percent), tumor size &lt;10 cm (69 versus 31 percent), and better five-year survival (91 versus 30 percent, p&lt;0.001). In multivariate analysis, the most significant independent predictors of disease-specific death were age greater than four years and distant disease. After accounting for tumor size, the only significant predictor of cancer-specific death was age 5 to 19 years.</p><p>There are other differences between ACCs presenting in childhood and those arising in adults:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children with adrenocortical tumors have associated familial cancer syndromes (mainly Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/188\" class=\"abstract_t\">188</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histopathologic characteristics and molecular mechanisms of ACC in children differ from those in adults.

Secondly, 50 percent or more of pediatric ACCs in North America are associated with germline mutations in the <em>TP53 </em>gene (which encodes the p53 tumor protein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/189,190\" class=\"abstract_t\">189,190</a>]. In adults, loss of heterozygosity for 17p13 (the cytogenetic location of the <em>TP53</em> gene) occurs in 25 to 70 percent of sporadic ACCs, but germline mutations in <em>TP53</em> are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma/abstract/191-194\" class=\"abstract_t\">191-194</a>].</p><p/><p>Because of these distinct pathogenic and prognostic characteristics of pediatric patients, extrapolation of clinical management from studies in adults is unreliable.

However, some contemporary series suggest that patients with ACC are living longer. The reasons for the possible improvement in prognosis are unclear, but adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> therapy appears to be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progress in treating advanced ACC has been severely limited by the rarity of the disease. However, multicenter clinical trials for recurrent and advanced disease, several of which are studying molecularly targeted therapy, are in progress. (See <a href=\"#H4164879\" class=\"local\">'Newer and investigational approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>Initial treatment, potentially resectable disease:</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The only potentially curative treatment for ACC is surgical resection. Although resection is technically possible in most patients with stage I to III disease, it is not curative for many, presumably because occult micrometastases are present at the time of initial presentation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initial surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with potentially resectable stage I to III adrenocortical cancer who are surgical candidates, we recommend complete surgical resection as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest open rather than laparoscopic resection regardless of tumor size (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Suspicious lymph nodes should be resected, but the benefit of routine lymphadenectomy has not been fully established yet. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initial surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> therapy for all patients who have a high risk of disease recurrence after complete resection, including all those with high-grade disease (Ki67 &gt;10 percent or mitotic rate greater than 20 per 50 high-power fields [HPF]), incompletely resected disease, intraoperative tumor spillage or fracture, and some large tumors that are low grade but have vascular or capsular invasion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Although there are no high-quality data to support this practice, a cisplatin-based adjuvant regimen might be considered in conjunction with mitotane in patients who are thought to be at high risk for an early recurrence, eg, very high Ki67 staining (&gt;20 percent) and extensive vascular <span class=\"nowrap\">invasion/vena</span> cava thrombus. (See <a href=\"#H15861690\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemotherapy with or without mitotane'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal duration of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> therapy is not established. We treat high-risk patients for five years. For those with a lower risk of recurrence, we prefer five years of therapy but aim for at least two to three years, as tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H957045\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If available, serum monitoring during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> therapy should be used to achieve therapeutic levels and avoid toxicity. Mitotane levels should be maintained between 14 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Suggested regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid replacement is necessary following resection of cortisol-secreting ACC. It should also be started in patients with non-cortisol-secreting tumors when adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> therapy is initiated because the drug's adrenolytic activity will result in adrenal insufficiency in most patients. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> for glucocorticoid coverage. Supraphysiologic doses become indicated because mitotane progressively accelerates cortisol metabolism by induction of the P450 system. (See <a href=\"#H1762852265\" class=\"local\">'Adrenal insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mitotane</a> can also eventually cause aldosterone deficiency.

When clinical and biochemical signs of aldosterone deficiency become present, addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> (0.1 to 0.3 mg daily) is initiated and adjusted to restore normal clinical and biochemical parameters. (See <a href=\"#H1762852265\" class=\"local\">'Adrenal insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the addition of postoperative radiation therapy (RT) for all patients with incompletely resected ACC, stage III disease, those who have tumor spillage at the time of resection, and for all patients with high-grade ACC (&gt;20 mitotic figures per 50 HPF) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is disagreement as to the role of adjuvant RT in patients who have undergone laparoscopic resection for an ACC that otherwise does not meet criteria for postoperative RT. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Posttreatment surveillance includes computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen every three months for two years, then every six months for five years. The benefit of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) in the posttreatment surveillance strategy is controversial, and practice is variable. (See <a href=\"#H68910287\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with a completely resected, steroid-producing ACC, some groups monitor patients every three months for two years with steroid tumor markers such as cortisol (measured in the morning before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> dose), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol, or mineralocorticoid based on the steroid profile in the initial tumor. Other groups do not routinely screen for recurrent hormone excess unless or until there is evidence of recurrent disease. (See <a href=\"#H68910294\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>Unresectable, recurrent, or advanced disease:</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with isolated, locally recurrent ACC that is surgically accessible, we suggest complete surgical resection followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Local therapy'</a> above). Resection may also be considered in the rare patient who presents with limited, potentially resectable hepatic or pulmonary metastases and for selected patients with uncontrollable symptomatic hormone excess.

However, for most patients, we suggest combined mitotane plus chemotherapy rather than mitotane or chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients receiving combined therapy, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a> in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (EDP) rather than streptozotocin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>).
