The nomenclature for the species of <em>Pneumocystis</em> that infects humans has been changed from <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em> to <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>; this was done to distinguish it from the species that infects rats.</p><p>HIV-infected patients with a low CD4 count are at the highest risk of PCP. Others at substantial risk include hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients, those with cancer (particularly hematologic malignancies), and those receiving glucocorticoids, chemotherapeutic agents, and other immunosuppressive medications.</p><p>The treatment and prophylaxis of PCP in patients without HIV infection will be reviewed here. PCP in HIV-infected patients and the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of PCP in HIV-uninfected patients are discussed separately.

The dose of TMP-SMX for patients with normal renal function is 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (dosing is based upon the TMP component and expressed as <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of TMP) intravenously or orally daily in three or four divided doses. For renal dose adjustment recommendations, see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> drug information. Because TMP-SMX has excellent bioavailability, oral administration is appropriate for all patients who have a functioning gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>For patients with allergy to TMP-SMX, desensitization should ideally be performed since TMP-SMX is the most effective regimen. However, if the patient has a history of a severe allergy (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), TMP-SMX should be avoided and desensitization should <strong>not</strong> be performed.

Accordingly, we recommend monitoring potassium levels before and periodically after the institution of TMP-SMX therapy. Other adverse effects are discussed in greater detail separately.

These recommendations have been extrapolated from the recommended duration of therapy for patients with HIV infection, who have a greater risk of relapse with 14 than 21 days of therapy, and who have a greater organism burden and slower clinical response than HIV-uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

A clinician with expertise in the management of PCP (eg, an infectious diseases specialist) should be consulted to assist with the management of patients with severe or protracted illness despite appropriate therapy.</p><p>After completing the course of treatment, patients should continue to receive antimicrobial therapy at a reduced dose to prevent recurrent infection (ie, secondary prophylaxis). The antimicrobial regimens used for secondary prophylaxis are the same as those used to prevent initial infection and are described below.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) as the preferred medication for the treatment of PCP in patients without HIV infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61052 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The dose of TMP-SMX for patients with normal renal function is 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (dosing is based upon the TMP component and expressed as <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of TMP) intravenously or orally daily in three or four divided doses. The usual duration of therapy is 21 days. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with allergy to TMP-SMX, desensitization should ideally be performed since TMP-SMX is the most effective regimen. However, if the patient has a history of a severe allergy (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), TMP-SMX should be avoided and desensitization should <strong>not</strong> be performed. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative regimens are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Alternative agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest using adjunctive glucocorticoids in HIV-uninfected patients who, while breathing room air, have an arterial blood gas measurement that shows a partial pressure of oxygen &le;70 mmHg or an alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient &ge;35 mmHg or hypoxemia on pulse oximetry (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcomes for immunocompromised patients without HIV infection treated for PCP are generally worse than in those with HIV infection; mortality from PCP in patients with HIV is approximately 10 to 20 percent compared with 35 to 50 percent in those without HIV. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection control</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalized patients with PCP should be assigned to standard precautions, although they should not be placed in the same room with other immunocompromised individuals due to the potential for person-to-person spread.

(See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest PCP prophylaxis for patients taking a purine analog in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest PCP prophylaxis for patients with rheumatologic diseases who are treated with significant doses of glucocorticoids (eg, &ge;20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> daily for one month or longer) in combination with a second immunosuppressive drug, particularly a cytotoxic agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>), as is commonly used in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener&rsquo;s) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients who require PCP prophylaxis, we recommend TMP-SMX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79988\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79988 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For patients with normal renal function, TMP-SMX may be given as one double-strength tablet daily or three times per week or as one single-strength tablet daily.
