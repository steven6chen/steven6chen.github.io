INH also disrupts DNA, lipid, carbohydrate, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6642420\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectrum of activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>INH is active against intracellular and extracellular <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. The organism is considered most susceptible to INH during its logarithmic phase of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isoniazid-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <em>M. tuberculosis </em>for INH ranges from 0.01 to 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for the organism are equivalent for most isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isoniazid-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Of the atypical mycobacteria spp, <em>M. kansasii</em> and <em>M. xenopi </em>are considered the most susceptible, while <em>M. avium</em> complex is generally resistant to INH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6642064\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>INH is well absorbed after oral administration (approximately 90 percent). Peak serum concentrations occurring 0.5 to 2 hours after an oral dose range from 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> after a 300 mg dose and from 9 to 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> after a 900 mg dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isoniazid-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Absorption following oral therapy may be delayed or reduced by food and antacids. Limited evidence is available to suggest that patients with HIV infection may exhibit malabsorption of antituberculous agents, including INH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isoniazid-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>INH is widely distributed in the body (including cerebrospinal fluid and breast milk), with a volume of distribution ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg</span>. Protein binding is low (&lt;10 percent).</p><p>Acetylation is the main route of INH metabolism, which is genetically determined and differs among ethnic groups. Approximately 50 percent of Caucasians and African-Americans are rapid acetylators and 80 to 90 percent of Asians and Eskimos are rapid acetylators. As a consequence, rapid acetylators may exhibit lower peak serum concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isoniazid-an-overview/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The elimination half-life ranges from 1 to 1.8 hours in fast acetylators to 3 to 4 hours in slow acetylators. </p><p>The major route of elimination is the kidney, with 75 to 96 percent of the dose excreted in urine as unchanged drug or metabolites. Slow acetylators excrete a higher percentage as unchanged drug compared with rapid acetylators (30 to 35 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isoniazid-an-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Acetylator status does not appear to influence the clinical outcome of most treatment regimens for tuberculosis. The one exception is the use of once-weekly regimens in rapid acetylators, which are associated with higher treatment failure rates. However, testing for acetylator status at initiation of therapy is not performed routinely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6642318\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug interactions result from the ability of INH to inhibit the cytochrome (CYP) hepatic enzyme system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isoniazid-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Higher single doses (ie, 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> rounded to the nearest 50 mg or 100 mg; 900 mg maximum) are used for once-, twice-, or three-times weekly regimens. Oral INH should be administered one hour before or two hours after meals. The risk of peripheral neuropathy can be reduced by concomitant administration of pyridoxine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a>).</p><p>INH is available in tablet (100 and 300 mg), liquid (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL),</span> and injectable forms. The liquid formulation in the United States is available in a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> base and often in combination with pyridoxine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a>). The sorbitol in this preparation may induce diarrhea, especially at higher doses. The intramuscular preparation should be administered at the same dose as oral therapy. It has been given intravenously, although it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this route. INH is also available in combination preparations, which may include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a>.
