Body temperature is normally around 98.6&ordm;F (37&ordm;C). Hypothermia is when it drops below 95&ordm;F (35&ordm;C).</p><p>Hypothermia can happen after being in cold air or water for too long. Young children and elderly people are more likely to get hypothermia.</p><p>Hypothermia can cause serious problems, or even death, if it is not treated quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175117924\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hypothermia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83975 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shivering (but if hypothermia becomes severe, the person might actually <strong>stop</strong> shivering)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clumsiness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble speaking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing faster than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating more than usual</p><p/><p>Because hypothermia can happen slowly and cause confusion, a person might not realize that he or she has it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175117939\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I help a person who might have hypothermia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think someone might be in danger of hypothermia, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move the person to a warmer place as soon as possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take off any wet clothing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cover the person with blankets</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offer warm beverages if the person is able to drink</p><p/><p>If you think you or another person might have frostbite (damage to a body part caused by cold), do <strong>not</strong> rub or massage the affected skin. This can cause worse damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175117954\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call for help?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a person shows signs of moderate or severe hypothermia, get medical care right away. Signs include passing out, trouble speaking or thinking clearly, clumsiness, loss of shivering, and trouble breathing. Waiting to get treatment could cause serious health problems or even death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175117969\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hypothermia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on how serious it is. In many cases, getting out of the cold and warming up with blankets can prevent the need for medical care.</p><p>Severe hypothermia needs to be treated in the hospital. Doctors will check the person's temperature. They will also try to make sure the person keeps breathing and that his or her heart keeps beating.</p><p>Hospital treatment of hypothermia might include any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blankets, heating pads, warm baths, or heaters that blow warm air &ndash; These can all be used to help bring a person's body temperature back up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm fluids through IV (a thin tube that goes into a vein)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm oxygen to breathe, or a breathing tube if needed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warming the inside of the body with water &ndash; Warm salt water can be used to bring heat to the organs. The water goes into the body through a small tube, then back out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Sometimes medicines are needed to treat related issues like low blood pressure or heart problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood rewarming &ndash; This is done with a special machine that draws blood out of the body, warms it up, and then puts it back in.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175117984\"><span class=\"h1\">Can hypothermia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. In most cases, you can prevent hypothermia by being careful not to stay out in the cold for too long. Be sure to dress warmly enough, and wear layers. Change out of wet clothes as quickly as possible.</p><p>Babies and young children are more likely than adults to get hypothermia. That's because their bodies have a harder time keeping warm, and they might not always notice when they are getting too cold. Make sure that children are dressed warmly and wear hats and mittens in cold weather. Don't let them play outside in the cold for too long without taking a break to warm up.</p><p>Elderly people also have a harder time than younger adults keeping warm, and they are more likely to have health issues or take medicines that can affect body temperature. You can help older people by making sure that their homes are kept warm enough, especially in winter.</p><p>People who have problems with alcohol also have a higher risk of getting hypothermia. That's because alcohol can make it harder to notice when your body is getting too cold. Drinking too much can also cause you to pass out, which can lead to hypothermia in cold weather. If you think you or someone you know might have a drinking problem, talk to a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H336862244\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=frostbite-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Frostbite (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
