The anterior rectus fascia (ie, pubovaginal sling) and pubic bone are the most common superior attachments for bladder neck slings; however, the superior rectus fascia is preferred as most high-quality outcome data use the rectus fascia. In addition, bone anchors, used to attach the sling to the pubic bone, are associated with osteitis pubis and osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and offer no improvement in outcomes.</p><p>Sling materials include autografts (rectus fascia or fascia lata), allografts (fascia lata), xenografts (porcine dermis), and synthetic meshes (mersilene or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene).

It likely provides direct compression to the proximal urethra or provides a hammock against which the urethra is compressed during increases in abdominal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415856625\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder neck slings are reserved for women in whom midurethral slings are contraindicated or were unsuccessful, or who decline to have a synthetic sling. A position statement notes that the midurethral sling is the standard of care for SUI, largely due to the decreases in morbidity and voiding dysfunction associated with midurethral slings as compared with bladder neck slings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

While treatment of SUI was similar for both procedures, the bladder next slings had an increased length of stay, operating time, perioperative complication rate, and detrusor overactivity. However, the study group consisted of five randomized controlled trials, and the evidence was felt to be of low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20186378\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All women undergoing bladder neck slings should <strong>at a minimum</strong>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Report bothersome SUI <strong>symptoms</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstrate <strong>signs</strong> of SUI (ie, transurethral urine loss with increase in intraabdominal pressure prior to surgery). </p><p/><p>Office evaluation is adequate for women with predominant SUI symptoms planning to undergo a bladder neck sling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. If the urinalysis, cough stress test, and postvoid residual urine volume are consistent with uncomplicated SUI, then urodynamic testing can be avoided. The additional information provided from urodynamic testing may be warranted in women who have failed prior incontinence surgery, who have complicated urinary tract histories, who have urethral incompetence, or who have symptoms of mixed urinary incontinence.

Rectus fascial sling is typically classified as a &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; procedure for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A retrospective analysis of VTE in women undergoing urogynecologic surgery who were treated with sequential compression devices reported a VTE incidence of 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415856770\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autologous bladder neck slings are constructed from abdominal rectus fascia or fascia lata. Rectus fascia was used in the earliest reported slings as it was in the operative field, and it continues to be the best studied sling graft material. Fascia lata is a reasonable alternative if the rectus fascia is insufficient or there is a large pannus. Rectus fascia and fascia lata share the benefits of being autologous materials with low rates of graft-related complications and failures when compared with allografts, xenografts, and synthetic meshes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The harvested fascia is placed transvaginally at the level of the proximal urethra, adjacent to the bladder neck. Permanent sutures are attached to the corners of the sling, passed retropubically, then secured superiorly above the rectus fascia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The technique varies somewhat based on the sling material (autologous fascia, allograft, xenograft, or synthetic); however, the most high-quality outcome data exist using rectus fascia as the sling material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Our technique for autologous rectus fascial sling is described in more detail below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthesia &ndash; Rectus fascial sling procedures are performed in the operating room under regional or general anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positioning &ndash; The patient is positioned in dorsal lithotomy position to allow for combined access to the lower abdomen and vagina. A bladder catheter is inserted and kept for the remainder of the case.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Harvesting fascia and preparing sling &ndash; A small 4 to 5 cm transverse suprapubic incision is made and a rectangular piece of rectus fascia (approximately 2 x 8 cm) harvested. The harvest site is closed in a tension-free fashion using a delayed absorbable suture. Permanent sutures are affixed to the four corners of the harvested rectus fascia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal dissection &ndash; A midline incision is made in the anterior vaginal wall at the level of the urethrovesical junction. The urethrovesical junction is easily identified by applying gentle downward traction on the bladder catheter so the balloon resides at the bladder neck, and thus identifies the urethrovesical junction. Using a combination of blunt and sharp dissection, the surgeon creates peri-urethral and retropubic tunnels bilaterally; the tunnels start in the vaginal dissection and extend into the retropubic space. Once the surgeon can feel the bottom of the pubic symphysis in the peri-urethral tunnel, she advances her finger into the retropubic space (aiming towards the ipsilateral shoulder), while gently swiping the bladder medially to prevent perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing sling &ndash; A long instrument (eg, uterine packing forceps or Stamey needle) is passed through the rectus fascia, behind the pubic bone, into the retropubic space and exits through the vaginal incision described in the paragraph above. The sling suture arms are grasped with the clamp and then passed from the vaginal to the abdominal fields. This is repeated on both sides, so that the sling lay under the urethrovesical junction or proximal urethra. Several fine absorbable sutures are placed to fix the sling to the periurethral tissues. Although surgeons have used bone anchors in the pubic symphysis as the superior sling attachment site, rectus fascia is preferred because bone anchors are associated with complications such as osteomyelitis pubis and do not improve the continence outcome. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystoscopy &ndash; Cystoscopy is performed with a 70-degree cystoscope to ensure the sling and dissection have not perforated the bladder and both ureters efflux briskly. The urothelium should also be assessed for any abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tensioning sling &ndash; The sling suture arms are then pulled up and tied above the rectus fascia, so the sling lays at the proximal urethra under no tension. A small curved clamp can be placed between the sling and the urethra; the clamp prevents overtightening the sling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incision closure &ndash; The vaginal skin incisions using a running fine absorbable suture; the skin incision is closed in a subcuticular fashion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20186444\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER SLING MATERIALS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261417131\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous slings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fascia lata and rectus fascia share the benefits of being autologous materials with low rates of graft-related complications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failures when compared with allografts, xenografts, and synthetic meshes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. While no comparative data exist, most surgeons prefer rectus fascia to fascia lata because it is done through the same suprapubic incision that is used to secure the sling arms to the rectus fascia. Fascia lata harvesting requires patient repositioning during the surgery to allow access to the leg, and a leg incision. However, fascia lata is an alternative for patients with contraindications to harvesting rectus fascia (eg, prior low ventral hernia repair with mesh).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415857289\"><span class=\"h2\">Allograft slings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allograft<em> </em>slings (cadaveric fascia lata or lyophilized dura mater) have been used to decrease the morbidity associated with harvesting autologous grafts (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reconstructive materials used in surgery: Classification and host response&quot;, section on 'Allografts'</a>). However, allograft bladder neck slings are less effective when compared with autologous bladder neck slings. In a 2011 meta-analysis of six trials, patient-reported improvement rates within one year of surgery favored autologous rectus fascia over other biological materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In general, allografts are reserved for patients who are not candidates for mesh and who decline the use of autografts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415857295\"><span class=\"h2\">Xenograft slings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xenograft bladder neck slings are generally not used secondary to high SUI recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The rationale for xenograft use was to minimize morbidity associated with harvesting allografts and complications associated with mesh.

At six months postoperatively, SUI improvement rates in the porcine dermis arm were significantly lower than autologous fascial and mesh slings (73 versus 95 versus 92 percent, respectively). Similarly, a case series using porcine dermis bladder neck slings reported SUI success rates of 43 percent, with a mean time to recurrence of 10.4 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415857301\"><span class=\"h2\">Synthetic slings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder neck and midurethral slings are synthetic type I meshes constructed of polypropylene (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reconstructive materials used in surgery: Classification and host response&quot;, section on 'Synthetic materials'</a>). The majority of incontinence slings are midurethral polypropylene slings. The use of other synthetic material for bladder neck slings (polyethylene and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) has been associated with urethral erosion rates of 8 and 12.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164574928\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor complications or adverse events after autologous fascia bladder neck sling can range from 29 to 63 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>], while serious adverse events in one randomized trial occurred in only 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

A commonly used protocol includes retrograde filling the bladder with 300 mL of sterile saline or water through the patient&rsquo;s catheter. The catheter should be immediately removed and the patient asked to void on the toilet with a collection device to measure the voided volume. If the patient voids at least 150 mL, the catheter does not need to be replaced. Women with elevated postvoid residual urine volumes (&gt;150 ml) should have some type of ongoing bladder drainage (intermittent self-catheterization, indwelling transurethral catheter, or suprapubic catheter) until urinary retention resolves (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-urinary-retention#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute urinary retention&quot;, section on 'Acute management'</a>). In women undergoing midurethral sling, no patient who met these criteria required additional catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; however, given the higher retention rates after bladder neck slings, the false positive rate may be higher. Occasionally, if urinary retention persists, additional surgery may be necessary to loosen the sling. The timing for facial sling release varies by surgeon and ratio of voided to postvoid residual urine volumes over time. If the patient requires catheterization beyond four to six weeks, we recommend loosening of the sling to minimize risks of developing urinary urgency and urgency incontinence. Pelvic floor physical therapy with mobilization of the vaginal and abdominal incisions can hasten resumption of normal voiding in some women. </p><p>Incisional pain is typically well controlled with oral antiinflammatory agents and narcotics. Patients can expect pain resolution in the first few weeks after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients are counseled to expect some vaginal spotting from the vaginal incision and refrain from placing anything in the vagina or having vaginal intercourse for four to six weeks while the incision heals.

The same review compared six trials of bladder neck slings using biologic material and determined that patient-reported improvement rates within one year of surgery favored autologous fascial sling over other biological materials (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21-0.98).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20187243\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder neck slings are reserved for rare women in whom midurethral slings are contraindicated or for women who were unsuccessful or decline to have a synthetic sling. Midurethral slings are preferred because of similar efficacy with decreased morbidity, urinary tract infection, and voiding dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H415856625\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women undergoing bladder neck slings should, at a minimum, report bothersome SUI symptoms, demonstrate signs of SUI, and have a normal postvoid residual urine volume and a negative urinalysis. (See <a href=\"#H20186378\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Office evaluation is adequate for women with predominant SUI symptoms planning to undergo a bladder neck sling. If the urinalysis, cough stress test, and postvoid residual urine volume are consistent with uncomplicated SUI, then urodynamic testing can be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H20186378\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative prophylactic antibiotics and thromboembolism prevention should be given to women undergoing bladder neck slings. (See <a href=\"#H20186378\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectus fascia harvested from the patient (autologous graft) is the preferred non-mesh graft material because it has the highest success rate for treating SUI and minimizes the number of surgical sites. (See <a href=\"#H415856770\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allografts are reserved for patients who are not candidates for mesh or autologous graft, but the continence failure rates are higher than for mesh and autologous graft. We do not use xenografts because of the high rate of SUI recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H20186444\" class=\"local\">'Other sling materials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder neck fascial slings are placed at the level of the proximal urethra or bladder neck. The superior attachment of the sling arms is to the rectus fascia. We do not use bone anchors because of higher risk of failure and complication. (See <a href=\"#H415856770\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common complications of bladder neck slings include cystitis, urinary retention, and voiding dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H164574928\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All women should undergo a standardized voiding trial after placement of a bladder neck sling. A common protocol includes retrograde filling the bladder with 300 mL of sterile saline or water through the patient&rsquo;s catheter. The catheter should be immediately removed and the patient asked to void on the toilet with a collection device to measure the voided volume. If the patient voids at least 150 mL, the catheter does not need to be replaced. Women with elevated postvoid residual urine volumes (&gt;150 ml) should have some type of ongoing bladder drainage (intermittent self-catheterization, indwelling transurethral catheter, or suprapubic catheter) until urinary retention resolves. (See <a href=\"#H415856891\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continence rates after bladder neck slings vary by comparator but are generally acceptable with high patient satisfaction rates. (See <a href=\"#H20186456\" class=\"local\">'Continence rate'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-bladder-neck-fascial-sling-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Oliphant SS, Wang L, Bunker CH, Lowder JL.
