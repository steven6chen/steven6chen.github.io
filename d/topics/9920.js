Nearly all patients with SCLC are current or former smokers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SCLC is distinguished from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by its rapid doubling time and high growth fraction, and the early development of metastases. SCLC usually presents with disseminated disease, and treatment strategies have focused on systemic therapy. For patients with limited-stage disease, treatment also includes radiation therapy directed toward thoracic disease, as well as prophylactic treatment of the brain. </p><p>The initial management of patients with limited-stage SCLC is reviewed here.

However, both the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) recommend Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging for SCLC as well as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>)). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193052398\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited-stage disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LS-SCLC is defined as disease that is limited to the ipsilateral hemithorax and regional lymph nodes and can be encompassed in a safe radiotherapy field. Most patients with LS-SCLC will have clinical or pathologic evidence of mediastinal lymph node involvement. Thorough staging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, is indicated for all patients. For patients with clinical stage I (T1 to 2, N0) disease, invasive staging of mediastinal lymph nodes is also indicated to identify the small fraction of patients who do not have lymph node involvement or other metastatic disease. The general approach for evaluating patients with SCLC is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F100443\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100443 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with stage I (T1 to 2, N0) LS-SCLC who have no evidence of distant metastases or hilar or mediastinal lymph node involvement, and no other contraindications to surgery, resection of the primary tumor with lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node sampling or dissection is indicated. This should then be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with four cycles of cisplatin-based therapy. For patients in whom surgery identifies lymph node involvement in the pathologic specimen, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is generally indicated. (See <a href=\"#H193051647\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer#H31490992\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of surgery in multimodality therapy for small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Postoperative radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with LS-SCLC who have clinical or pathologic evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymph node involvement, chemoradiotherapy is indicated as the initial treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1147048869\" class=\"local\">'Benefit of treatment'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Four cycles of chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with SCLC because of the high frequency of early dissemination. Considerable effort is being devoted to the development of more effective chemotherapy strategies to control systemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H193051647\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to chemotherapy, there is a significant role for radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of LS-SCLC. Local tumor progression occurs in up to 80 percent of such patients treated with chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The high local recurrence rate can be significantly reduced by the addition of thoracic RT, and survival is improved when thoracic RT is added to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1147047671\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic cranial irradiation is indicated for patients with a complete or partial response to their initial chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with SCLC and symptoms of superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, initial chemotherapy is the treatment of choice, rather than RT. The clinical response to chemotherapy alone is usually rapid. RT may be required for patients in extreme distress due to SVC obstruction or in those who do not respond to chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy for lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and germ cell tumors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193052406\"><span class=\"h2\">Extensive-stage disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with SCLC present with ES disease, with distant metastases, malignant pericardial or pleural effusions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> contralateral supraclavicular and contralateral hilar lymph node involvement. Some patients with contralateral supraclavicular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> contralateral hilar lymph node involvement may be candidates for concurrent or sequential definitive chemoradiotherapy if the disease burden is low and all disease can be safely encompassed by a tolerable RT field. The management of patients with ES-SCLC is discussed separately.

However, SCLC is highly responsive to both multiple chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation therapy (RT). The results with treatment vary significantly depending upon the extent of disease. </p><p>For patients with LS-SCLC treated with contemporary chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation, overall response rates of 80 to 90 percent, including 50 to 60 percent complete response rates, are typically reported. Median survival is around 17 months, and the five-year survival rate is about 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The impact of treatment on patients with extensive-stage (ES)-SCLC is discussed separately.

Subsequent studies used EP in a similar sequential approach and demonstrated favorable response and survival rates with relatively tolerable toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>These regimens were compared in a trial in which patients with either LS- or ES-SCLC were randomly assigned to CAV, EP, or CAV alternating with EP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The 146 patients with LS-SCLC received thoracic RT to 40 to 50 Gy after four cycles of chemotherapy. For patients with LS-SCLC, response rates to initial chemotherapy were significantly higher with EP (77 percent) and <span class=\"nowrap\">CAV/EP</span> (88 percent) compared with CAV (51 percent); overall survival was similar in all three treatment arms (EP 11.7 months; <span class=\"nowrap\">CAV/EP</span> 11.8 months; CAV 12.4 months). Based on these early studies, many oncologists adopted EP as the standard-of-care since it resulted in less myelotoxicity and was easier to combine with thoracic RT in patients with LS-SCLC due to a lower risk of mucosal and pulmonary toxicity.</p><p>More recently, EP was compared with another alkylator-based regimen, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epirubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epirubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> (CEV), in 214 patients with LS-SCLC; thoracic RT (42 Gy) was given between the third and fourth cycles of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Overall survival was significantly better in patients assigned to EP, with a median survival of 14.5 months versus 9.7 months and two-year survival rates of 25 versus 8 percent in the EP and CEV arms, respectively. There was no difference between arms in the number of patients who received definitive thoracic radiotherapy, PCI, or second-line chemotherapy for relapse. These results in favor of EP are consistent with the findings of two meta-analyses that demonstrated a modest survival advantage in studies evaluating etoposide-based or cisplatin-based therapy in patients with both LS- and ES-SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Overall, these studies should confirm EP as the preferred regimen for the treatment of patients with LS-SCLC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445795472\"><span class=\"h3\">Carboplatin versus cisplatin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Carboplatin</a> is frequently substituted for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> to reduce the risk of nonhematologic toxicities, such as nausea, vomiting, ototoxicity, neuropathy, and nephropathy. However, due to the potential curability of LS-SCLC and the relatively small number of LS-SCLC patients evaluated thus far, cisplatin remains the standard agent, with carboplatin restricted to patients with contraindications to or poor tolerance of cisplatin.</p><p>A meta-analysis that included 663 patients in four trials compared the efficacy of cisplatin-based versus carboplatin-based regimens in SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Only 32 percent of patients in the meta-analysis had LS-SCLC, since only two of the trials enrolled patients with LS disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Overall, response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival were similar with cisplatin-based and carboplatin-based regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The findings appeared to be the same for patients with LS and ES disease.

After induction, 256 patients without progression were randomly assigned to consolidation with either irinotecan plus cisplatin or etoposide plus cisplatin. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, between the two treatment arms (median 2.8 years with irinotecan plus cisplatin versus 3.2 years with etoposide plus cisplatin, hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.80-1.46).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193051706\"><span class=\"h3\">Paclitaxel-containing regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The addition of a third drug to a standard platinum plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> regimen has been evaluated in an effort to improve the overall outcome of patients with SCLC.

One meta-analysis, which included 11 randomized studies, found that the addition of thoracic RT was associated with an absolute improvement in local control of 23 percent (two-year local control rate 47 versus 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The chemotherapy regimens differed among the studies, as did the thoracic RT doses and delivery schedules. Another meta-analysis of 13 randomized trials (including the same 11) found that the use of combined chemotherapy and thoracic RT resulted in an absolute survival benefit of 5.4 percent at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The survival benefit associated with the use of thoracic RT outside of clinical trials was confirmed in a more recent review from the National Cancer Data Base [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC), the five-year survival rate for the 6752 patients diagnosed in 2000 was significantly higher in patients treated with thoracic RT plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone (13.3 versus 5.7 percent).</p><p>While the benefit of radiation in one of the meta-analyses was greatest for patients younger than 55 years old, with a trend towards detriment in patients age 70 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], modern radiation techniques and supportive care have improved such that the benefits may outweigh toxicities for the older population as well. A retrospective analysis of approximately 8600 patients age 70 years and older treated between 2003 and 2011 found that the addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy was associated with improved overall survival rates (15.7 percent absolute overall survival benefit at three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies of thoracic RT for SCLC provide evidence of a dose-response effect. Most thoracic RT regimens that employ conventional (once daily) fractionation use doses of approximately 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Regimens of accelerated hyperfractionation typically administer 45 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions.</p><p>In a retrospective analysis of SCLC patients treated with once daily fractionation, improved local control rates were observed as the total dose delivered increased from 30 Gy to 50 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Reported 2.5-year local control rates were 16 percent for patients who received 30 Gy, compared with 63 percent for patients who received 50 Gy. A third study showed a local control rate of 96 percent for 26 patients with LS-SCLC who received 60 Gy thoracic RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for once daily RT delivered in 2 Gy fractions and for twice daily RT delivered in 1.5 Gy fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The MTD for once daily RT was not reached and was therefore considered to be &gt;70 Gy, and the MTD for twice daily RT was 45 Gy. The follow-up phase II study demonstrated the safety of 70 Gy in 35 once daily fractions delivered over seven weeks concurrently with chemotherapy in patients with LS-SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite some uncertainty, the use of limited field thoracic RT is the current standard of care. Specifically, the treatment volume should include all gross disease present at the time of radiation planning (postchemotherapy volume), and all nodal regions involved at the time of initial diagnosis (prechemotherapy volume). PET scans should be obtained for staging if RT is planned for patients with suspected LS-SCLC. </p><p>Treatment with these smaller fields is associated with a reduction in the severity of toxicity from combined modality therapy, and it does not appear to jeopardize local control rates. Such toxicity issues will have increasing importance as both radiation and chemotherapy doses are intensified and agents with potential lung toxicity are added to chemotherapy regimens.</p><p>Historically, thoracic RT treatment volumes included all gross disease present at the time of initial diagnosis (prechemotherapy volume), as well as prophylactic inclusion of adjacent uninvolved nodal regions. Several lines of evidence support the use of more limited thoracic RT fields to include only the postchemotherapy tumor volume and prechemotherapy nodal volume:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performed a randomized trial, in which 191 patients with LS-SCLC who had a partial response or stable disease following induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned to thoracic RT fields that included either the prechemotherapy or the postchemotherapy tumor volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This study did not show a significant difference in patterns of failure or median survival between the two regimens. There was no apparent difference in severe drug-related toxicity or severe radiation pneumonitis between the thoracic RT groups. However, the frequency of severe complications related to myelosuppression was higher for patients treated with wide field thoracic RT (17 of 93 [18 percent], versus 8 of 98 [8 percent] with reduced field thoracic RT).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of 59 patients with LS-SCLC treated at the Mayo Clinic also failed to show a significant difference in the rates of local recurrence, progression-free survival, or overall survival for patients treated with thoracic RT fields that covered the prechemotherapy versus postchemotherapy tumor volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this series, all local failures occurred within the thoracic RT fields. There were no failures at the margin of a field, which would have implied that the treated volume was too small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) conducted a randomized study comparing daily thoracic RT to twice daily thoracic RT (with a treatment break) and all patients were treated to fields including postchemotherapy volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. They reported that less than 7 percent of local recurrences included a component of disease outside of the treatment field, further supporting the use of involved field thoracic RT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phase II trial from the Netherlands treated 27 patients with LS-SCLC with 45 Gy of twice daily thoracic RT and concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The RT volume was confined to the primary tumor and lymph nodes involved on the initial pretreatment computed tomography (CT) scan. Three patients developed an isolated nodal failure (crude rate 11 percent) and all of these were in the ipsilateral supraclavicular region. The same group performed a subsequent study that was similar to the above approach, except that the nodal tumor volume included in the RT field was based on a prechemotherapy PET scan. With this approach, there were only 2 of 60 isolated nodal failures (crude rate of 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Interestingly, the PET scans showed nodal involvement not appreciated on CT scans in 15 percent of cases. Further study is warranted, but these data suggest the importance of using PET staging for patients with suspected LS-SCLC if elective nodal irradiation is omitted.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fractionation schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard radiation fractionation schedules employ single daily treatments of 1.8 to 2 Gy, five times per week, over a continuous course for about six weeks. Our preferred approach, however, is to use an accelerated hyperfractionation schedule, in which a course of radiation is given over a shorter total treatment time (acceleration) and with a greater number of treatment fractions (hyperfractionation).</p><p>Although available studies suggest that hyperfractionated RT in combination with chemotherapy yields better overall survival than standard RT, the use of hyperfractionation regimens is considerably more complex, increases the patient's daily treatment time, and is associated with more acute toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. However, due to flaws in the design of prior studies, such as the lack of comparison of hyperfractionated RT with high-dose once daily RT regimens (eg, 60 to 70 Gy), the ultimate role for such alternative fractionation schedules has not been fully clarified, and further studies are ongoing. Nevertheless, hyperfractionated RT (45 Gy given in twice daily fractions over three weeks) is clearly a standard treatment option for LS-SCLC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Accelerated hyperfractionation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accelerated hyperfractionated RT reduces the opportunity for tumor cell regeneration during treatment by shortening the overall treatment time. However, acute toxicities are greater to normal tissues. Late toxicities should be similar, given that late effects of radiation are more dependent on dose per fraction and total dose than overall treatment time. Several randomized trials comparing once- and twice-daily thoracic RT have been performed, but the results do not resolve the issue of which approach is superior.</p><p>In the CONVERT trial, 547 patients with LS-SCLC were randomly assigned to twice-daily concurrent chemoRT (45 Gy in 30 fractions) versus once-daily concurrent RT (66 Gy in 33 fractions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. At a median follow-up of 45 months, the median survival in the twice-daily versus once-daily group was 30 versus 25 months, respectively, a difference that was not statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] 1.18, 95% CI 0.95-1.45). Neutropenia was more frequent in the twice-daily group (74 versus 65 percent). In patients assessed for radiotherapy toxicity, there was no difference in grade 3 to 4 esophagitis (19 percent in both groups) or radiation pneumonitis (3 versus 2 percent in the twice- versus once-daily treatment groups).&nbsp;Eleven patients died from treatment-related causes (three in the twice-daily group and eight in the once-daily group).</p><p>In a previous trial by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, 417 patients with LS-SCLC were randomly assigned to 45 Gy of concurrent thoracic RT, either as once-daily treatments for five weeks or twice-daily treatments over three weeks. Those receiving twice-daily treatment experienced improvement in five-year survival rate (26 versus 16 percent with once-daily treatment), but with more frequent severe esophagitis, such that patients could not swallow solids or required opiates or feeding tube placement (27 versus 11 percent). Severe hematologic and pulmonary toxicities, which were reported in prior trials of hyperfractionation, did not differ significantly in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/39,44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,44-48</a>]. Although this study showed that 45 Gy given twice daily was more efficacious than 45 Gy given once daily, it did not compare 45 Gy twice daily with once-daily treatment with a higher dose (60 to 70 Gy), which is more frequently used in contemporary regimens. Nonetheless, these results have established 45 Gy given twice daily over three weeks as a standard regimen for the treatment of LS-SCLC. </p><p>In a separate trial by the NCCTG, 262 patients with LS-SCLC were randomly assigned to once-daily (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions) or twice-daily (48 Gy in 32 fractions, with a two week break after 24 Gy) thoracic RT beginning with cycle 4 of a planned 6 courses of EP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Both local control and overall survival (two-year survival rates, 45 versus 47 percent) were similar in both study arms. However, the relevance of this study is limited by the fact that the hyperfractionated treatment was started late in the chemotherapy course and was interrupted by a two-week break, both of which may have adversely affected the efficacy of this regimen.</p><p>Although we prefer twice-daily administration to a total of 45 Gy given results of the CONVERT trial showing a nonsignificant trend towards improved survival and no increase in severe radiotherapy-induced toxicity, we recognize that in the setting of inconclusive data, once-daily treatment to a total of 60 to 70 Gy is also an acceptable option.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Split course treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperfractionated thoracic RT has also been delivered as a split course treatment with alternating regimens of chemotherapy and thoracic RT. In a pilot study by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), thoracic RT consisting of 1.5 Gy given twice daily over five continuous days was delivered after the first, second, and third cycles of EP chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The two-year progression-free survival for this series was 47 percent.

Sequential therapy refers to treatment with one modality at a time, while concurrent therapy indicates that chemotherapy and thoracic RT are delivered simultaneously. Alternating therapy refers to delivery of thoracic RT on days when chemotherapy is not given, in such a fashion that the timing of the next chemotherapy cycle is not altered. In this treatment scheme, thoracic RT is necessarily delivered as a split course.</p><p>The concurrent and alternating approaches are intuitively appealing because they enable delivery of multiple chemotherapy cycles without interruption. Insofar as SCLC is a systemic disease, the optimal delivery of systemic treatment is crucial. However, concurrent or alternating regimens have been associated with more toxicity (myelosuppression, esophagitis, pneumonitis) when compared with sequential treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The concurrent group began RT on day 2 of the first chemotherapy cycle. There was a sizeable, absolute improvement in median and overall survival that favored concurrent RT, although the differences did not reach statistical significance (median survival 27 versus 20 months with sequential RT, p = 0.10). The survival rates at two, three, and five years also favored concurrent RT (54 versus 35, 30 versus 20, and 24 versus 18 percent, respectively).

Full doses of chemotherapy were received by 83 percent of patients in the early RT arm and 84 percent of patients in the late RT arm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another trial, 107 patients with LS-SCLC were randomly assigned to thoracic RT with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>,</span> followed by four cycles of EP, or to two cycles of EP followed by thoracic RT with <span class=\"nowrap\">carboplatin/etoposide</span> (starting week 6) and then two additional cycles of EP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Thoracic RT consisted of 54 Gy given in 1.5 Gy fractions twice daily. Five-year overall survival favored the early treatment arm compared with the late arm (30 versus 15 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There were no chemotherapy dose reductions in either arm. Of note, there was no difference between the two groups in the rate of distant metastases, but there was a significantly better local control rate for those assigned to the early treatment arm.</p><p/><p>Two meta-analyses have examined the optimal timing of thoracic RT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis reported in 2004, which included seven randomized trials published after 1985, showed a significant improvement in two-year overall survival for early versus late thoracic RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Subset analysis showed that this benefit was more pronounced with the use of hyperfractionated RT and platinum-based chemotherapy. These results are consistent with the opinion that standard treatment for LS-SCLC should include the use of cisplatin-containing regimens and concurrent therapy with thoracic RT delivered early.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2005 Cochrane meta-analysis that incorporated data from seven randomized trials was unable to determine the optimal strategy for integrating chemotherapy and thoracic RT in patients with LS-SCLC, although several of the studies included did not use EP chemotherapy delivered at full doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, an additional meta-analysis from the same group indicated that the most important factor associated with improved five-year survival was a short interval between the start of any treatment and the completion of thoracic RT (relative risk [RR] 0.62) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This observation was attributed to the phenomenon of accelerated repopulation during treatment. The importance of a short time between start of treatment and completion of RT can also be inferred from a report that analyzed outcome for 215 patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic RT during cycle 2 or 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. On multivariate analysis, RT treatment interruptions due to toxicity were the most important adverse prognostic factor for survival.</p><p/><p>In all three of the studies that demonstrated a marked survival advantage for early thoracic RT, patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy and both the early and late treatment arms had similar high rates of patients receiving full doses of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/40,41,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,55</a>]. In contrast, the randomized trials that did not demonstrate an advantage for early thoracic RT either did not use cisplatin-based chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a lower percentage of patients in the early thoracic RT arms received full dose chemotherapy compared with those in the late thoracic RT arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/49,53,54,56,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,53,54,56,58</a>]. These deficits may suffice to explain the lack of an observed benefit for early thoracic radiation therapy in those studies. The importance of receiving all planned chemotherapy was further supported in another meta-analysis of eight trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Although there are conflicting data regarding the optimal timing of thoracic RT relative to chemotherapy, the studies that employed standard EP chemotherapy delivered with minimal dose reduction all showed a clear benefit for early thoracic RT. Thus, delivery of thoracic RT integrated early (in cycle 1 or 2) with chemotherapy is the current standard of care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
