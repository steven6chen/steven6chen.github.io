Branch occlusion can result in visceral ischemia (renal, intestinal, hepatic, splenic), spinal cord ischemia, or extremity ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The renal and mesenteric vessels are the most commonly affected aortic branches.

Malperfusion can be present on initial presentation or develop anytime later; thus, any change in the patient's clinical condition should not be dismissed, particularly any aortic dissection involving the abdominal aorta or iliac vessels. Malperfusion that occurs after the acute dissection timeframe (ie, after two weeks) is uncommon but can imply a new dissection process, particularly if associated with acute pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H182796695\" class=\"local\">'Refractory pain in spite of adequate medical treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Malperfusion is typically manifested as clinical symptoms and signs in combination with laboratory markers and often confirmed with diagnostic imaging. Intestinal ischemia, spinal ischemia, and lower extremity ischemia are generally readily suspected based upon typical clinical features (eg, abdominal pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">paraplegia/paraparesis,</span> pulse deficit). The clinical features and diagnosis of intestinal and lower extremity ischemia are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mesenteric arterial occlusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Renal dysfunction associated with renal artery obstruction as a result of type B aortic dissection is notoriously insidious in onset and often requires additional diagnostic evaluation to identify. Unilateral renal malperfusion can lead to resistant hypertension while bilateral malperfusion causes progressive renal insufficiency. Since hypertension is nearly universal in patients with type B dissection (both history as well as at presentation), renal ischemia will be suspected based upon the evolution of marked difficulty in controlling hypertension, a rising creatinine, declining hourly urine output, or less commonly with flank pain. Any of these should prompt further diagnostic evaluation for renal malperfusion syndrome.

The average aortic expansion rate was 1.7&plusmn;0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year</span>. Multivariate analysis identified white race and smaller initial aortic diameter (&lt;4.0 cm) as significantly associated with expansion. Persistent false lumen flow increases the risk for chronic dilation, whereas thrombosis of the false lumen is protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

This paradigm shift is due to a desire to reduce the appreciable morbidity and mortality associated with open surgical repair but acknowledges the limitations of endovascular procedures (endograft, fenestration), which may not reliably relieve obstruction of more distal aortic branches. (See <a href=\"#H108606140\" class=\"local\">'Open surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Perioperative morbidity and mortality with open surgery for the treatment of acute, complicated type B aortic dissection has been high, with reported perioperative mortality rates that range widely from 20 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Data from a later International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) database suggest an improving mortality rate for complicated type B dissection with perioperative mortality rates of 17 percent with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/8,47-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,47-54</a>]. Invariably, these seemingly suboptimal outcomes are largely related to the presentation of the patient. In the IRAD study, <span class=\"nowrap\">hypotension/shock</span> at presentation and periaortic hematoma were the primary determinants of mortality and poor outcome (60 percent mortality); those patients with normal blood pressure had fewer adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Surgical therapy was most often graft replacement of the descending thoracic aorta (&gt;80 percent of patients), and the repair technique included hypothermic circulatory arrest in nearly one-half of the operations. The remainder of patients were treated with surgical fenestration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>In the first use of a stent-graft for patients with acute aortic dissection, 15 of 19 patients had complicated type B dissection (the others were type A dissections) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Malperfusion in 22 vessels in 11 individuals was obstructed exclusively by dynamic mechanism, and all were reperfused by stent-graft placement alone. For those obstructed by a combination of dynamic and static mechanisms (15 vessels), 6 of the 15 reperfused after stent-graft placement proximally. The technical success for eliminating false lumen flow was 100 percent. Later reports have similar initial technical success rates of 85 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Overall mortality was 16 percent. </p><p>Early data from the IRAD registry suggested significant differences for in-hospital death depending upon the type of treatment. For surgically treated patients, mortality was 32 percent compared with 7 percent for those managed with endovascular techniques and 10 percent for those managed with medical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>].

Compared with surgery, the pooled perioperative mortality rate (four studies) was significantly reduced for endovascular compared with open repair (odds ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.09-0.39). There were no significant differences between the groups for any of seven short-term complications, reintervention, or for long-term mortality. In a later IRAD review, perioperative mortality was significantly lower for endovascular repair compared with open surgery (11 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Complications during hospitalization were also lower for the endovascular group (20 versus 40 percent). In a review of 3092 type B aortic dissections, one- and two-year survival rates ranged from 80 to 90 percent, and 72 to 90 percent, respectively, which were improved compared with historical series of open surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3196800689\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic predisposition</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3307497669\"><span class=\"h3\">Syndromic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An open surgical approach to repair should be used in patients with syndromic thoracic aortic <span class=\"nowrap\">aneurysm/dissection</span> (TAAD; eg, Marfan, vascular Ehlers-Danlos, Loeys-Dietz, and Turner syndromes). Aortic stent-grafts should <strong>not</strong> be used in the native thoracic or abdominal aorta in these patients. Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders have been a strict exclusion criterion in all commercial stent-graft trials. The reliability of deployment of a stent-graft in the fragile milieu of the Marfan aorta and the question of what effect the persistent radial force of the stent-graft may have on the Marfan aorta remains unanswered. An expert consensus recommended against endovascular repair for these patients unless the risk of open surgery is deemed truly prohibitive at a center experienced in management of complex aortic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This opinion is shared by the majority of surgeons experienced in central aortic surgery. A report of thoracic endovascular repair in eight patients with connective tissue disorder (six with Marfan syndrome, two with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) demonstrated initial success with few major complications, but a high rate of secondary intervention was needed due to continued aortic expansion; the study authors proposed that the technique may be justified in emergencies as a &quot;bridging&quot; method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

The incidence in one IRAD study was 1.3 percent (18 of 1417 patients enrolled) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. A presentation that included abdominal pain, mesenteric infarction, or limb ischemia was more prevalent in isolated abdominal aortic dissection compared with a typical dissection emanating from a tear near the left subclavian artery. Hypotension was present in 12 percent, which was a greater incidence compared with typical type B dissection, and thus the presentation is not likely to be easily distinguished from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm without imaging. </p><p>The outcome of medically treated patients with isolated abdominal aortic dissection is worse compared with that of patients with typical type B dissection. In the IRAD study, 33 percent of patients treated medically had died at four-year follow-up, compared with none of the patients treated with open surgery or endovascular repair. In light of this late mortality exceeding typical type B dissection, early repair seems justified. Given the complicated anatomy, most abdominal aortic dissections are not amenable to endovascular repair and will require an open approach, although an endovascular approach has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H980510015\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic aneurysmal dilation (aneurysmal dissection)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients who survive the acute phase of their dissection, some may develop progressive enlargement of the aorta with time, referred to as an aneurysmal dissection (pseudoaneurysm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/29,67-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,67-72</a>]. An endovascular approach is generally suggested for anatomically suited sporadic aneurysmal dissection (not genetically mediated) while open aortic replacement is suggested for syndromic disease. However, the role for endovascular repair continues to evolve. The aortic diameter threshold for repair of chronic aneurysmal dilation in a chronic dissection is similar to that for repair of true aortic aneurysm. These thresholds are discussed in detail separately.

The technical success rate was 90 percent. Survival ranged from 59 to 100 percent for a median follow-up of 24 months. Endoleak, predominantly type I, developed in 8.1 percent, and aneurysm of the distal aorta or continued false lumen perfusion with aneurysmal dilatation developed in 7.8 percent of patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159301368\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several types of endovascular interventions can be used in the management of acute type B aortic dissection. Endovascular interventions for acute type B aortic dissection are complementary, and a given patient may require any one procedure, or combination of procedures, to reliably relieve malperfusion. As a secondary goal, though not yet proven, endovascular stent-graft therapy may reduce the incidence of late aneurysmal degeneration by reducing false lumen flow. For patients with aortic rupture, endovascular repair is feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>] but may require adjunctive embolization of the false lumen to stop ongoing bleeding. Endovascular techniques have also been used to manage immediate or delayed complications related to primary endovascular repair (eg, endoleak, stent migration) or late chronic issues (eg, late aneurysmal dilation) related to medically or surgically treated type B aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].

Ultrasound can document the location of the proximal entry tear, the anatomy of visceral and renal branches in relation to the true and false lumens, and can identify the dissection septum that may be overlying branch orifices to produce malperfusion in a dynamic or static manner. For patients with iliofemoral thrombosis or leg malperfusion, ultrasound also identifies the compressed true lumen and can aid with needle and wire introduction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108605713\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159301375\"><span class=\"h3\">Coverage of entry tear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique for aortic stent-graft placement for patients with aortic dissection has several important differences compared with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for thoracic aneurysm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although secure proximal fixation is needed for both pathologies, dissection patients very commonly have little to no distance from the left subclavian artery origin to the intimal tear of type B dissection. Thus, coverage of the left subclavian artery may be required more often in dissection patients. This is usually well tolerated without significant arm symptoms. The optimal extent of coverage of the thoracic aorta and deployment of stent-grafts remains unclear. It is likely that a longer stent-grafted length may be more effective for achieving thrombosis of the false lumen, but this may be at the expense of an increased risk for paraplegia. </p><p>Coverage of the entry tear with a stent-graft restores perfusion in approximately 75 percent of patients by relieving dynamic aortic obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>].

Balloon-expandable stents into the proximal visceral, renal, and iliac vessels should be avoided, as they may be crushed by the dissection flap mobility.</p><p>Technical success to reduce gradients can approach 90 percent, and complications related to the branch vessel stenting are rare (&lt;10 percent), largely relating to minor access site complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159301389\"><span class=\"h3\">Fenestration of septum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fenestration of the intimal flap (ie, creating a communication between the true and false lumen) may be performed with one of several techniques that use a combination of ultrasound and fluoroscopy for guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The ideal hemodynamic result for fenestration of the dissected intima is equalization of peak systolic pressures between the two lumens in the aorta, and decompression of the false lumen. However, because of the potential dramatic and unpredictable alterations in intimal flap anatomy and flow dynamics that can occur by overly aggressive fenestration in the visceral aorta, investigators with the largest series of patients recommend limiting percutaneous fenestration to the distal aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p>In a series of 40 patients with malperfusion syndromes, 14 patients underwent combined stenting and balloon fenestration, 24 underwent stenting alone, and two underwent fenestration alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The location of the balloon fenestration was in the thoracic aorta in eight patients, in the upper abdominal aorta in three patients, and just above the aortic bifurcation in seven patients. Flow was restored to the ischemic territories in 37 of 40 patients (93 percent), but the 30-day survival was 75 percent. After the periprocedural period, five additional patients died, with one of these deaths related to false lumen rupture and two of unknown etiology. This perioperative mortality rate of 25 percent compares favorably with the historical surgical series for open surgical fenestration. </p><p>The effect of fenestration on long-term outcomes with respect to false lumen expansion in patients with distal dissections is unknown, since the false lumen remains pressurized and therefore at risk for continued progression to aneurysm. In one series of 46 patients with malperfusion treated by either stent-graft therapy (n = 12) or balloon fenestration (n = 34), the aortic diameter decreased in patients treated with stent-grafts but increased in those with balloon fenestration only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. </p><p>Techniques for fenestration include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fenestration is most commonly performed from the smaller (usually true lumen) to the larger false lumen. A fenestration (hole, new opening) is created near the compromised aortic branch using a R&ouml;sch-Uchida needle, Brockenbrough needle, Colopinto needle, or the back end of a 0.014 wire. After the needle and a stiff wire are advanced from the true to the false lumen, a 5-F catheter is advanced. Confirmation of the position across the membrane is performed by contrast injection. Subsequently, an angioplasty balloon of at least 12 to 15 mm in diameter and 20 to 40 mm in length is used to create a fenestration tear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative technique of fenestration has been termed the &quot;scissors technique&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Stiff guidewires are placed in each lumen from a single femoral access, and a single long sheath is advanced over the two wires, thus dividing the membrane over this distance. Those familiar with the use of the &quot;scissors technique&quot; have reported both clean longitudinal tears (the ideal result) and circumferential separation of the flap from the aortic wall with aorto-aortic intussusception (not ideal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another technique uses a snare that can be used to deliver a wire from one femoral access through the flap and down the contralateral femoral access. By pulling this upside-down &quot;U&quot; toward the distal aorta, a fenestration defect may be created, but this technique has the same potential risk of intimal dehiscence. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4162629138\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications of endovascular repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, complications related to endovascular access and aortic stent-grafting are similar to those in endovascular repair for other indications (eg, abdominal aortic aneurysm) and include stroke, paraplegia, renal failure, and death. Major complications occur in 40 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Paraplegia rates are generally low, ranging from 0 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/17,18,36,39,57,73,74,80,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,36,39,57,73,74,80,83,84</a>], although one study reported a rate of 13.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. These rates are similar to reported rates for endovascular repair of other pathologies (eg, thoracic aortic aneurysm, blunt aortic injury).

In one study, 14 of 41 patients required reintervention for stent-graft migration, endoleak, aneurysmal expansion, and retrograde dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. On univariate analysis, false lumen thrombosis was associated with a lower risk for reintervention. Technical complications immediately related to stent-graft placement are unusual but may be lethal and unanticipated. One such procedural complication is retrograde dissection into the ascending aorta, which can occur immediately during device placement or later during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. The incidence is approximately 1 to 2 percent during the procedure and 1 to 20 percent with longer follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. Delayed presentations with acute chest pain, syncope, or sudden death can occur any time after device placement. Outcomes of the event are often lethal, with mortality rates up to 40 percent for retrograde type A dissection, regardless of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>Apart from secondary intervention for retrograde dissection, secondary device-related interventions may be required to obliterate flow in the false lumen. At one year after stent-graft placement for acute type B dissection, thrombosis of the false lumen adjacent to the device occurs in 70 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/84,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,89</a>]. A much lower rate of false lumen thrombosis occurs after stent-grafting for chronic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Most chronic false lumens remain patent via abdominal aorta reentry tears of the dissection septum in proximity to the origins of the visceral and renal vessels.

An open surgical approach replacing the thoracic aorta to the extent needed is preferred for patients with genetically mediated type B aortic dissection, rather than endovascular stent-graft placement. (See <a href=\"#H3196800689\" class=\"local\">'Genetic predisposition'</a> above.)</p><p>Impending or frank rupture of the aorta is most often addressed by open surgical graft replacement of the descending thoracic aorta.

The visceral and renal segment of the aorta may be considered for surgical fenestration when proximal stent-grafting and branch vessel stenting fail to control dynamic aortic obstruction. The procedure can be performed through a 9<sup>th</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup> intercostal space incision extending onto the anterior abdominal wall. The peritoneal contents can also be inspected for viability through the exposure. The distal thoracic aorta is cross-clamped and the aorta opened along its longitudinal axis, and the dissection flap in the upper abdominal aorta is resected. </p><p>Advocates for surgical fenestration assert that the results of treatment of type B dissection are often related to delays in diagnosis and treatment. The available literature would support such a notion, but it is limited by the low number of patients available for comparison. In a series of seven patients with ongoing renal and lower extremity ischemia treated with visceral aorta fenestration, no patients died, and temporary dialysis was required in only two cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. By comparison, in another series of 14 patients treated with surgical fenestration, mortality was 43 percent with all those who died noted to have a &gt;48 hour delay from the time of the diagnosis of malperfusion to fenestration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Long-term performance of surgical fenestration for type B dissection has been reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/74,93-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,93-96</a>]. In one study, the actuarial survival of the patients undergoing fenestration (n = 14) was 77 percent at one year and 53 percent at five years. The chief indication for fenestration was lower extremity ischemia, and infrarenal fenestration and aortobifemoral grafting were the procedures used. None of the late deaths was related to aortic disease, and none of the fenestrated aortas developed aneurysmal degeneration during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>Surgical fenestration may also be a viable option in patients who present with type A dissection and undergo standard ascending aorta repair but have evidence of ongoing malperfusion. In these patients, the presence of the residual aortic dissection in the arch may not allow secure stent-graft deployment and fixation to divert blood flow from the false lumen. As such, a direct surgical fenestration may provide definitive therapy if there is malperfusion of multiple territories (renal, visceral, lower extremity). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108605750\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute and chronic type B aortic dissection benefit from multidisciplinary management including expertise from cardiologists, vascular surgeons, cardiac surgeons, and interventional radiologists.

The most commonly affected aortic branches are the renal and mesenteric vessels. The time course of malperfusion is highly variable, and frequent clinical assessment is important. However, malperfusion that occurs after the acute dissection timeframe (&gt;2 weeks) is uncommon and can imply a new dissection process, particularly if associated with acute pain.

An open surgical approach may be needed for patients with rupture to rapidly control hemorrhage.

(See <a href=\"#H1159301389\" class=\"local\">'Fenestration of septum'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1159301382\" class=\"local\">'Stenting branch obstruction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H108606164\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal aortic fenestration/grafting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term clinical and imaging follow-up is necessary, as up to 50 percent of patients will have progression of their disease.
