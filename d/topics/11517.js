One reason for this difference is that young children are relatively protected from the mechanical forces that lead to facial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As they age, they participate in activities that increase the risk of exposure to such forces (eg, falls from height, sports, bicycle riding, etc).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nasal bones and mandible are the facial bones most commonly fractured in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nasal fractures occur more commonly than do mandibular fractures because they require less force to produce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Childhood nasal trauma typically results from falls, contact sports, weight lifting, and automobile crashes (usually involving bicyclists or pedestrians) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Child abuse also must be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most of these injuries are minor. In one retrospective series of 241 children with nasal injury 98 of whom were examined by rhinoscopy, 73 cases involved septal deviation, subluxation, or fracture (30 percent), 13 cases septal hematoma formation (5 percent), and 12 cases subperichondrial abscess (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The upper one-third of the nose is supported by the paired nasal bones and the frontal processes of the maxilla; the lower two-thirds are maintained by cartilaginous structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The superior portion of the nasal bones is thick and relatively resistant to fracture. In contrast, the inferior portion is thin and weak. The bony nasal septum articulates with the undersurface of the nasal bones to provide support to the nasal dorsum. The lacrimal bones and ethmoid labyrinth lie deep to this bony pyramid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A paired cartilaginous framework, separated in the midline by attachments to the quadrangular septal cartilage, provides support to the lower two-thirds of the nose. The upper lateral cartilages attach to the undersurface of the nasal bones and support the middle one-third. The lower lateral cartilages consist of medial and lateral crus, which join in the midline to form the tip of the nose and support the lower one-third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The rich blood supply of the nose, derived from the internal and external carotid arteries, accounts for the frequency and intensity of epistaxis and swelling in patients with nasal trauma. Kiesselbach plexus, the vascular watershed area of the anteroinferior nasal septum, is the site of origin of most nosebleeds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54180 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct blows to the nose can fracture the nasal skeleton and lead to displacement or depression of the nasal bones or septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because the nasal pyramid is variably cartilaginous during childhood, and the midline suture is unfused, greenstick fractures are more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In addition, trauma to the nasal septum can tear the blood vessels that are adjacent to the septal cartilage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hematomas form when blood collects in the space between the cartilage and the overlying mucoperichondrium. Expansion of the hematoma separates the cartilage from the mucoperichondrium, obstructing blood flow to the nasal cartilage and causing pressure-induced avascular necrosis of the nasal cartilage. Septal perforation and irreversible damage result after three to four days of ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The accumulated blood and necrotic tissue also form a nidus for infection with bacteria colonizing the nasal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Infection of a septal hematoma may induce rapid resorption of necrotic cartilage but is not necessarily a prerequisite for this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The replacement of necrotic tissue by fibrous tissue, retraction of scar tissue, and loss of support to the lower nose may lead to facial deformity, including saddle nose, displacement of the maxilla, retraction of the anterior nasal septum (columella), widening of the nasal base, and diminished size of the nasal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures occur with high impact to the central midface and involve complete separation of the nasal bones and the medial walls of the orbits from the frontal bone and the infraorbital rim. The bones typically are fragmented and displaced posteriorly into the ethmoid region. The medial canthal tendons, which are attached to the medial walls of the orbits, are shifted laterally with the fracture segments, resulting in increased inner canthal distance (traumatic telecanthus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

In addition, the signs and symptoms of nasal septal injury may evolve during the 24 to 72 hours after injury. Children with nasal trauma should have close follow-up and reexamination soon after the injury occurs. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.) </p><p>The presence of clear fluid in the nasal cavity may indicate a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak as the result of an associated skull fracture, usually through the cribriform plate. Fluid should be tested for beta-2 transferrin, which is present only in CSF, perilymph, and aqueous humor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Bedside tests that have been used to identify CSF, such a characteristic appearance when placed on filter paper (blood at the center, surrounded by a clear ring of CSF) and detection of glucose in the fluid, are unreliable.</p><p>Mucosal laceration with bleeding is suggestive of underlying cartilaginous injury. The septum should be examined for fracture, displacement, laceration, discoloration, and abnormal swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/10,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21</a>].

Thus, the area of the septum that appears to be deviated should be palpated with a cotton-tipped applicator to determine whether it is compressible.

Septal deviations that cause nasal airway obstruction in newborn infants should be repaired urgently by a pediatric otolaryngologist because newborns are preferential nose breathers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similarly, children with septal hematomas or abscesses warrant prompt pediatric otolaryngology consultation. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hematoma and abscess'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with nasal trauma should maintain upright posture to prevent the formation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> facilitate the resolution of edema and hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Tetanus prophylaxis may be indicated for children who have associated soft tissue injuries and dirty wounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who have no symptoms, minimal swelling, and no septal deviation or hematoma do not need specific follow-up. Patients with nasal fracture but no septal hematoma may be referred to the otorhinolaryngologist within three to five days. This brief delay in evaluation permits resolution of the edema, facilitating visualization of the nasal structures. In addition, if parents are instructed to bring a recent photograph of the child to the appointment, the otorhinolaryngologist can compare the nasal contours before and after the trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Deviation and fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deviation of the nasal septum that was noted on the initial evaluation can be reduced by the otorhinolaryngologist at the follow-up visit. The short delay in definitive treatment has little adverse effect on outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/15,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,38-40</a>]. However, delay beyond seven days may render reduction of nasal fractures more difficult or cause permanent displacement because the active growth centers in the child's nasal bones promote rapid healing. The fractured elements become difficult to mobilize after 7 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/10,15,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,21</a>].</p><p>Most nasal fractures in children can be managed with closed reduction. Fractures with splayed nasal bones and no impactions can be reduced with bilateral digital compression on the dorsum for 10 to 15 minutes. Nasal deviation to one side often can be reduced by digital compression on the side of the deviation. The end-point of reduction in children is difficult to appreciate because the cartilaginous elements neither move into place as readily as the ossified elements do in adults, nor do the elements &quot;snap&quot; into place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Use of intranasal instrumentation may be necessary if digital compression alone is not successful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74348 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53351\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53351 \">picture 3</a>). Open reduction may need to be performed if significant dislocations are present, the injury is more than two weeks old, or closed and intranasal instrumentation fail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematoma and abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of septal hematoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98339\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98339 \">picture 1</a>) and abscess should be carried out urgently by an otorhinolaryngologist.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Because the nasal pyramid is variably cartilaginous during childhood, and the midline suture is unfused, greenstick fractures are more common. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma to the nasal septum can tear the blood vessels that are adjacent to the septal cartilage and cause a septal hematoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98339\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98339 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of nasal symptoms following nasal trauma includes assessment of nasal obstruction, nasal bleeding, pain, anosmia, and cosmetic deformity. Symptoms of nasal septal hematoma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abscess consist of progressive nasal obstruction, persistent or worsening pain after trauma, rhinorrhea, and fever. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should perform a complete external and internal examination of the nose with attention to signs of associated injuries, including cervical spine injury, cerebrospinal fluid leak, naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures, and LeFort fractures. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs are not helpful in the diagnosis of nasal fractures in children and should not be performed solely for this purpose. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with clinical findings that suggest cerebrospinal fluid leaks, LeFort fractures, or naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures warrant computed tomography with axial and coronal images of the maxillofacial bones and the base of the skull and urgent consultation with an otolaryngologist. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with nasal fractures that cause airway obstruction and all patients with a septal hematoma should have prompt evaluation and care by an otolaryngologist. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hematoma and abscess'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal fractures with deviation of the nasal septum should be reduced by an otorhinolaryngologist within seven days. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Deviation and fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with nasal fractures should refrain from all sports activities for two weeks and from contact sports (eg, American football, lacrosse, or wrestling) for six weeks.
