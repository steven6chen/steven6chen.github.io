Patients with bipolar I disorder have manic episodes or mixed (concurrent mood elevation and depression) episodes, and nearly always experience depressive episodes. The clinical course in patients with bipolar II disorder is characterized by one or more episodes of major depression, with at least one hypomanic episode.</p><p>Recognition of bipolar disorder is important for at least two reasons: it is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality if untreated, and treatment differs from that of unipolar depression. Bipolar disorder is often misdiagnosed, especially when patients present with symptoms of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-depression/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A careful history, including information from family members, may find evidence of prior manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes.</p><p>The treatment of acute bipolar depression is reviewed here. Treatment of acute mania, mixed states, hypomania; maintenance treatment; and the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of bipolar disorder are discussed elsewhere.

Patients in the acute phase may be suicidal, psychotic, and display such poor judgment as to pose an imminent risk to themselves. Hospitalization is often necessary until the severity of symptoms lessens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The continuation phase lasts weeks to months, during which remission of symptoms and restoration of functioning is preserved with ongoing treatment. The goal is to prevent relapse of the mood episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maintenance phase of treatment lasts months to years after recovery from the mood episode, and aims to prevent recurrence of a new mood episode. Long-term or lifetime maintenance is recommended for patients who have suffered one manic episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-depression/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Maintenance treatment is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Choosing maintenance treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48563594\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of bipolar depression begins with the clinical assessment for risk of suicide, aggressiveness, and violence to others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-depression/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Patients should reduce their use of alcohol, and other substance use disorders should also be evaluated and treated. In addition, clinicians should address current psychosocial problems when patients are amenable. Patients who experience a breakthrough depressive episode while on maintenance therapy should be assessed for adherence to treatment, and initially managed by optimizing their current medication dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-depression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Although depressive episodes occur more frequently than manic episodes, and have greater impact on the quality of life, treatment of bipolar depression has not been as extensively studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-depression/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Treatment of depressive syndromes is based upon what has been established for bipolar I disorder, even though bipolar II disorder is more prevalent. </p><p>Drug classes commonly used to treat patients with acute depressive episodes include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antidepressants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticonvulsants </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-generation antipsychotics</p><p/><p>The goal of treatment is full remission of the depressive syndrome. However, some patients may not fully remit with any of the currently available medications, and it is important to maintain realistic expectations and avoid unhelpful polypharmacy. Persistent efforts to achieve full remission may be one reason that a study of 4035 bipolar patients, treated at 22 mood disorder specialty clinics, found use of three or more medications occurred in 40 percent of the patients, while 18 percent of patients received four or more medications. In addition, clinicians may need to consider other treatment options, such as psychotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89770741\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC TREATMENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3148203905\"><span class=\"h2\">Antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluoxetine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> efficaciously treats bipolar depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-depression/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial (833 patients with bipolar I depression) found that remission occurred in significantly more patients who received fluoxetine plus olanzapine, compared with olanzapine alone or placebo alone (49 versus 33 and 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-depression/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A review of these older studies, involving 160 patients, found that the &quot;unequivocal&quot; lithium response rate (ie, a good or moderate response to lithium, and subsequent relapse with placebo) was approximately 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-depression/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Onset of the antidepressant effect of lithium, at six to eight weeks, is much later than the onset of its antimanic effect.

Evidence for the efficacy of lamotrigine includes a meta-analysis of five randomized trials (1072 patients with bipolar major depression) that compared lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg per day) with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-pharmacotherapy-for-acute-depression/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) occurred in more patients who received lamotrigine than placebo (44 versus 35 percent). A planned subgroup analysis found that lamotrigine was superior to placebo for severe depression at baseline, but not for moderate depression. Discontinuation of treatment was comparable for lamotrigine and placebo. </p><p>Therapy usually begins with a dose of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for two weeks, then 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for two weeks, taken in two divided doses. The dose can then be titrated up as clinically indicated by 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> one week at a time for each increase. The target dose generally ranges from 50 to 200 mg per day; however, doses up to 400 mg per day may be required.
