The evaluation and management of women with suspected PTL are discussed separately.

These situations are associated with an increased probability of birth away from a tertiary care center and a birth that may incur significant morbidity for the mother <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> newborn. In these situations, we make the decision for, and the duration of, hospitalization on a case-by-case basis, depending on patient-specific factors.</p><p>The only randomized trial designed to determine whether hospitalization of women after resolution of an episode of PTL increased the proportion of deliveries &ge;36 weeks compared with women discharged home did not find a benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnant-women-after-resolution-of-an-episode-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this trial, 101 women with singleton gestations, intact membranes, mean cervical dilation of 2.7 cm, and a diagnosis of arrested PTL between 24+0 and 33+4 weeks of gestation were randomly assigned to hospitalization until 34+0 weeks or discharged home upon completion of a course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. Tocolytics were not administered; contractions ceased with conservative management alone (hydration, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>). In both groups, about 70 percent of women delivered at &ge;36 weeks of gestation. This trial was underpowered and is not generalizable to the more clinically relevant population of women with arrested PTL after tocolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnant-women-after-resolution-of-an-episode-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24606278\"><span class=\"h2\">Is bed rest beneficial?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not advise bed rest for women with a recent episode of PTL, given the lack of evidence of efficacy in prematurity reduction and the known significant risks of prolonged immobility. Not only is there no evidence supporting bed rest as an effective intervention for reducing the frequency of spontaneous preterm birth in singletons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnant-women-after-resolution-of-an-episode-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] or twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnant-women-after-resolution-of-an-episode-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but bed rest has known potential harms: It promotes loss of trabecular bone density, increases venous thromboembolism risk, produces musculoskeletal deconditioning, and places significant psychosocial strain on individuals and families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnant-women-after-resolution-of-an-episode-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/3,6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24606285\"><span class=\"h2\">Should exercise and work be avoided?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the general consensus that women at high risk for preterm birth should limit their level of <span class=\"nowrap\">exercise/physical</span> activity, particularly strength training and heavy lifting, in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnant-women-after-resolution-of-an-episode-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This opinion is based on indirect evidence from studies in healthy pregnant women. Most trials of exercise in pregnancy have excluded women at increased risk for PTL or who developed PTL during the trial; therefore, it is difficult to assess the effect of exercise on pregnancy outcome in these women. </p><p>We also believe it is prudent to suggest a reduction of recreational exercise regimens and occupational activity for women who have had one or more episodes of PTL. Specifically, we suggest that these patients avoid working more than 40 hours per week, night work, prolonged standing (more than a total of eight hours or more than four continuous hours per 24-hour period), and heavy physical work, as this activity level has been variably associated with PTL and preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnant-women-after-resolution-of-an-episode-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. However, the effect of occupational work on preterm birth is difficult to analyze because occupational activities are complex constructs involving duration of work, shift effects, psychological and physical stress, lifting (frequency and amount of weight), length of time standing, etc, and thus cannot readily be characterized in a simple way.

There is no strong evidence that sexual activity affects the risk of preterm birth or onset of labor in healthy women. However, it is theoretically possible that a small subgroup of susceptible women may develop PTL with sexual&nbsp;activity because both prostaglandins in semen and orgasm can increase myometrial activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnant-women-after-resolution-of-an-episode-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].
