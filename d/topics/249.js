Prior to the availability of percutaneous drainage, surgery was the only treatment for diverticular abscesses.

An anterior approach through the anterior abdominal wall is favored for most abscesses, while abscesses deep in the pelvis or obscured by other organs are drained transgluteally. Transrectal or transvaginal approaches to abscess drainage have also been described but are rarely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

During this time, catheter sinograms can be performed to examine the abscess cavity and to rule out persistent communications between the abscess cavity and bowel.</p><p>After percutaneous drainage of a diverticular abscess, patients typically defervesce within 24 to 48 hours. For patients who do not improve within that time frame, surgery is indicated.

Although percutaneous drainage of a diverticular abscess does not negate surgery, it allows surgery to be performed electively in a single stage for the majority of patients (60 to 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/26,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35-38</a>].

After a median follow-up of 62 months (range 28 to 98 months), 22 (30 percent) developed recurrent diverticulitis, including 13 uncomplicated recurrences that did not require surgery, and 9 complicated recurrences (12 percent) that required surgery. Two of the nine patients required emergency surgery with stoma for peritonitis.

Thus, the results of these studies cannot necessarily be generalized to patients who are admitted for diverticulitis because of complications, severe disease (eg, immunocompromised patients, high fever, significant leukocytosis), or because they failed outpatient therapy. Neither are these results applicable to outpatient therapy of acute diverticulitis, as all participants in the Swedish study and 93 percent of patients in the Dutch study were admitted to the hospital and given intravenous fluids.

This area, however, is controversial and constantly evolving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>In a retrospective study of over 200,000 patients admitted for diverticulitis, 85 percent were managed medically, of whom 16 percent suffered a recurrent attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Furthermore, more episodes of diverticulitis were not associated with a higher rate of conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p>Surgery, however, may be indicated in patients with recurrent diverticulitis who develop symptoms. In a systematic review of 80 studies, 20 to 35 percent of patients managed nonoperatively developed chronic abdominal pain, compared with 5 to 25 percent of patients treated surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Overall, approximately 15 percent of patients with acute diverticulitis will require surgical intervention at some time during the course of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], nearly all of whom have had either a complicated episode or several uncomplicated episodes of diverticulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2731952931\"><span class=\"h2\">Special patient groups</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2709283654\"><span class=\"h3\">Young patients (age &lt;40)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some studies reported more frequent and severe recurrences in patients younger than 40 years of age, and therefore advocated early elective surgery in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/79-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-84</a>], other studies suggested that the risk of recurrence is better predicted by the severity of the initial attack than the age of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/85-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-88</a>]. In our practice, we do not offer elective surgery to patients who have a history of diverticulitis simply because they are young, which is in concordance with the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons practice parameters for sigmoid diverticulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Surgery was traditionally offered to young patients after one episode of acute diverticulitis based upon two premises: that young patients have more virulent disease, and that young patients are more likely to develop recurrent diverticulitis that ultimately requires surgical intervention. Both premises have been refuted by contemporary data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/32,79-82,85,86,89-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,79-82,85,86,89-92</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease virulence </strong>&ndash; In a review of 1019 consecutive patients with acute diverticulitis, patients 40 years and younger had a similar risk of presenting with a contained (30.4 versus 29.5 percent) or frank perforation (26.1 versus 23.9 percent) compared with older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

While some studies reported readmission rates as high as 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>] and operative rates of 20 to 41 percent for recurrent attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/83,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,87,88</a>], another study reported no subsequent surgery required during a four-year followup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Overall, approximately 50 percent of young patients will require surgery at or after their first attack.

The correct clinical diagnosis is made in only 4 to 16 percent of cases, as patients with right lower quadrant pain are most often diagnosed with acute appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/98-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-100</a>].

When the diagnosis is made nonoperatively, medical management with antibiotics is usually sufficient. In a retrospective review of 41 patients with right-sided diverticulitis treated medically, only five patients developed recurrent symptoms and two required elective surgery after 11 years of follow up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. </p><p>Patients who are diagnosed with right-sided diverticulitis during exploratory operations for abdominal discomfort can undergo an appendectomy if the base of the appendix and the cecum are not inflamed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. This is then followed by antibiotic therapy. Diverticulectomy can be performed if there is a localized perforation of the involved diverticulum, although this practice is highly controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

The diagnosis is usually confirmed by an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, which also distinguishes complicated from uncomplicated disease. Based upon findings on the history, physical exam, and CT scan, patients are triaged to receive either inpatient or outpatient treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Inpatient versus outpatient treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outpatient treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis typically consists of oral antibiotics for 7 to 10 days. Some practitioners start patients on a restricted diet (eg, clear liquids) before advancing them to a soft or regular diet when they show clinical improvement. Others do not limit patient diet. Patients are reassessed clinically two to three days after the initiation of antibiotic therapy and weekly thereafter until the complete resolution of all symptoms. Repeat imaging studies are usually <strong>not</strong> necessary unless the patient fails to progress clinically. Patients who fail outpatient treatment are admitted for inpatient treatment. (See <a href=\"#H667444990\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inpatient treatment of acute diverticulitis varies depending upon if the patient has complicated or uncomplicated diverticulitis. Patients with complicated diverticulitis must undergo treatments specific for their complications (eg, perforation, abscess, obstruction, fistula). (See <a href=\"#H3439164942\" class=\"local\">'Inpatient treatment of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute colonic diverticulitis typically begins with administration of intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and parenteral pain medications. Patients can be made nil per os (NPO) to allow for bowel rest or be offered a clear liquid diet depending upon their clinical status. Patients without complications typically show clinical response within two to three days, at which point their diet can be further advanced. Patients who continue to improve are discharged with oral antibiotics to complete a total of 10 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy. Patients who fail inpatient treatment require surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1816757322\" class=\"local\">'Inpatient treatment of diverticulitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After successful out- or inpatient treatment of acute diverticulitis, patients are reassessed in six to eight weeks. Those who have persistent symptoms may have chronic smoldering diverticulitis and are referred for surgical evaluation. Those who are symptom-free should undergo colonoscopy to rule out colon cancer. Patients who have had complicated diverticulitis or who are immunosuppressed should be referred for elective surgery, while others may be observed with dietary and behavioral modifications to reduce the risk of recurrence. Additionally, patients who reside in or frequently travel to remote areas that lack medical resources may benefit from elective surgery to reduce the risk of recurrences. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Long-term management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After nonoperative management of acute diverticulitis, patients have a 16 to 42 percent risk of developing recurrent diverticulitis. However, prior uncomplicated attacks do not predict a higher incidence nor a higher severity of recurrence. Thus, the number of prior attacks is no longer used as a sole criterion for surgery. Overall, approximately 20 percent of patients with acute diverticulitis will require surgical intervention at some time during the course of their disease because of symptoms, nearly all of whom have had either a complicated episode or several uncomplicated episodes of diverticulitis. (See <a href=\"#H3700565761\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent diverticulitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2636981563\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Tonia Young-Fadok, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Everhart JE, Ruhl CE.
