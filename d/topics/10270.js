The condom acts as a barrier by preventing direct contact with semen, genital lesions, and sub-clinical viral shedding on the glans and shaft of the penis. It also prevents contact with penile, vaginal or anal discharges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF CONDOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Condoms are available in a variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and thicknesses, with or without lubricants or spermicides, and with or without reservoir-tip or nipple-ends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They can be straight-sided or tapered toward the closed end, textured (ribbed) or smooth, solid-colored or nearly transparent, and odorless, scented, or flavored. Most are about 7 inches (180 mm) long, 2 inches (52 mm) wide, and up to 0.003 inches (0.08 mm) thick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Material</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Condoms are made of latex rubber, natural membranes, or synthetic material.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rubber (latex)</strong> &mdash; Approximately 80 percent of male condoms available in the United States are manufactured from natural rubber latex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They are generally less expensive than condoms made from other materials. The dual protection provided by latex condoms against unintended pregnancy, as well as many STIs (particularly HIV), is well documented. However, latex condoms cannot be used by persons with latex sensitivity or allergy, and are not compatible with oil-based lubricants or medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Natural membrane</strong> &mdash; A small proportion (&lt;5 percent) of condoms are made from the intestinal cecum of lambs (&quot;natural skin,&quot; &quot;natural membrane,&quot; or &quot;lambskin&quot; condoms). While any type of lubricant can be used with these condoms, in contrast to latex condoms, natural membrane condoms contain small pores that may permit the passage of viruses, including hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus, and HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. No contraceptive or STI prevention effectiveness data are available. Because of their porosity, they may not provide the same level of protection against STIs as latex condoms and should not be recommended for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Synthetic</strong> &mdash; Polyurethane and other synthetic materials, such as polyisoprene, are also used to manufacture condoms and account for the remaining 15 percent of condoms. Compared to latex condoms, synthetic condoms are generally non-allergenic, compatible with both oil-based and water-based lubricants, and have a longer shelf-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The effectiveness of synthetic condoms to prevent STIs has not been well-studied; however, synthetic condoms are believed to provide STI protection similar to latex condoms.</p><p/><p>For pregnancy prevention, synthetic condoms have rates of contraceptive failure comparable to latex condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Spermicide coated condoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Condoms prelubricated with a small amount of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 (N-9) are no more effective than other lubricated condoms, have a higher cost and shorter shelf-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and may cause adverse effects in users. In one study, spermicidal condom use was associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections in young women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Given these disadvantages and the absence of any advantages of spermicidal condoms, their use is not recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every condom is tested electronically for holes and weak spots before it is packaged and released for sale. Samples of condoms also undergo a series of additional laboratory tests for leakage, strength, dimensional requirements, and package integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If the sample condoms fail any of these tests, the entire lot is rejected and destroyed. A 2009 Consumer Reports Survey showed that all condoms tested met industry standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and previous surveys reported that test performance did not vary with price, thickness, or country of manufacture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Condom effectiveness depends on the skill level and experience of the user [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Couples vary widely in their ability to use male condoms consistently and correctly. An estimated 2 percent of women will become pregnant during the first year of perfect (ie, consistent and correct) use of the condom, and about 18 of every 100 will become pregnant during the first year of typical use. The typical use and perfect-use effectiveness of a variety of contraceptive methods, including condoms, is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>). The marked difference in contraceptive failure rates between perfect and typical use is attributable to failure to use condoms during every act of sexual intercourse and failure to use condoms correctly throughout intercourse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Protection from STIs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary noncontraceptive benefit of condom use is the protection offered against STIs. This is an important benefit and an indication to use latex (or synthetic) condoms even if effective contraception is provided by another method, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization. A general consensus exists that male condoms should play a central role in any <span class=\"nowrap\">STI/HIV</span> prevention program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A condom placed on the penis before any genital contact and used throughout intercourse reduces the risk of partner-to-partner transmission of infectious pathogens associated with semen; penile, vaginal, cervical, and anal epithelium; and penile, vaginal, or anal discharges. Laboratory studies indicate that latex condoms provide an effective physical barrier against passage of even the smallest sexually transmitted pathogen (hepatitis B) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. The level of protection observed during actual use varies because STIs differ in their routes of transmission, infectivity, and prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Condoms greatly reduce the risk of STIs transmitted primarily to or from the penile urethra, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, hepatitis B infection, and HIV. Condoms should also reduce the risk of STIs transmitted primarily through skin or mucosal surfaces (eg, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, chancroid, and both human papillomavirus and human papillomavirus-associated diseases) when these areas are covered by the condom. However, the protection may be less when condoms do not completely cover the entire infected area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/3,4,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,24-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Well-designed clinical studies of discordant couples (where one partner is HIV-infected and the other is not) have shown that consistent use of latex condoms is highly effective against sexually acquired HIV infection. One meta-analysis suggests that consistent condom use reduces the risk of acquiring HIV by approximately 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Across 13 cohort studies reviewed, only 11 seroconversions occurred among 587 couples reporting consistent use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Other STIs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical studies of effectiveness of condoms against most other STIs also suggest protection, though the level of protection observed has been inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/23-25,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25,29-32</a>]. Much of this inconsistency can be attributed to limitations in study design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/23-25,32-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25,32-43</a>], as the overall quality of clinical studies for these STIs is considerably weaker than for the HIV studies. Despite these limitations, studies and systematic reviews have found condom use to be associated with reduced risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, genital herpes, and HPV infection in both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/23,29-32,44-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29-32,44-62</a>]. By preventing STIs and their long-term sequelae, condoms also protect female fertility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Condom promotion for STI prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although widespread support exists for targeted interventions to encourage condom use, concerns have been raised about the potential negative consequences of condom promotion. Some interventions promoting condom use may result in risk compensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>], thus facilitating the onset or frequency of high-risk sexual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Few randomized controlled trials have evaluated whether such a compensation effect exists or whether it outweighs the protective effects of condom use for persons at risk. However, a systematic review of 174 sexual risk reduction intervention studies concluded condom-related interventions do not undermine sexual risk reduction efforts by increasing the frequency of sexual behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Prevention of STIs through use of condoms, as well as other methods, is discussed in detail separately.

Counseling should be adapted to each client's needs since clients may have formed their own attitudes about condom use and may have had varying experiences with condoms. Similarly, the counseling session should be tailored to each client's risk factors and abilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>As with all contraceptive counseling, clients should understand the risks and benefits of the range of contraceptive methods available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>.) Pregnant women at high risk for acquiring STIs should be counseled to use condoms to protect their fetus, their partner(s), and themselves. Women at high medical risk if they become pregnant should be counseled to use a highly effective contraceptive method and should understand the risk of using a less effective method, such as condoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The most effective approaches for improving condom use are unclear. A Cochrane review of behavioral interventions with an educational or counseling component to encourage or improve condom use was unable to find strong evidence of the efficacy of this approach compared with another behavioral intervention, usual care, or no intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Latex sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When exposed to latex-containing products, persons sensitive or allergic to natural rubber latex may experience irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, or systemic anaphylactic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. It is estimated that 1 to 6 percent of the US population is allergic to latex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], but the prevalence can be much higher in certain groups, such as health care workers and patients who have repeated exposure to latex-containing medical devices (surgical and examination gloves, catheters, intubation tubes, anesthesia masks, dental dams) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Irritant contact dermatitis in adults&quot;</a>.) Additional comprehensive information on latex allergy can also be obtained from the American Latex Allergy Association (see <a href=\"http://www.latexallergyresources.org/&amp;token=M3jQeLY+ov1ZbvLuyNg7oOCqzjx20L/q4OoYVl8r2fX1PdLXDy/bWui/3nNmKjNW&amp;TOPIC_ID=5463\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.latexallergyresources.org</a>).</p><p>All clients should be questioned for potential latex allergy: as an example, does the client experience itching, rash, or wheezing after wearing latex gloves or inflating a balloon? [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. If latex sensitivity is suspected, the client can be referred for allergy skin testing or offered nonlatex condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Allergic reactions that occur only after exposure to latex condoms and not after exposure to other latex-containing products may be due to brand-specific condom attributes, such as spermicides, lubricants, perfumes, local anesthetics, or other chemical agents added during the manufacturing process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In these cases, clients are advised to try a different brand.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGIES FOR PROMOTING EFFECTIVE CONDOM USE</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Effective use of condoms depends heavily on the skill level and experience of the user</strong> &mdash; Appropriate counseling can minimize problems with condom use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Interventions promoting condom use should address user-related behaviors that result in inconsistent use, incorrect use, or nonuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emphasize that condoms should be used with every coital act</strong> &mdash; Make sure clients understand that condoms are most effective when used correctly during every act of anal, vaginal, and oral intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Strategies that emphasize condom use for contraception in addition to disease prevention may help decrease nonuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Recommend that clients use a new condom for each act of intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/27,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,79</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Instruct the client on use</strong> &mdash; Encourage inexperienced clients to practice using condoms on a model of a penis or a banana. Many problems that occur during condom use can be attributed to inexperience and can be overcome with practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Users who have had negative experiences with condoms may be at risk of discontinuing condom use altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inform the client to use the condom during the entire sexual act</strong> &mdash; Some men put condoms on after starting intercourse or remove condoms prior to ejaculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/37,82-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,82-88</a>]. These behaviors could expose partners to risk of pregnancy or STI. Clients should be counseled to use condoms throughout intercourse, from beginning of genital contact to after ejaculation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Provide condoms at low or no cost to encourage use</strong> &mdash; In some settings, providing clients with a large number of condoms at low or no cost increases convenience and thus may increase consistent use. Providing clients with only a few condoms is only a short-term solution for clients who find the health care system inaccessible or who find it embarrassing to return repeatedly for condoms. Selling condoms, even at a low cost, dramatically reduces the number of condoms a client will obtain from a clinic compared with the number of free condoms <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> will take.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discuss what to do if a condom slips or breaks</strong> &mdash; Although users often fear that the condom will break or fall off during use, these events are relatively rare. The majority of studies show that condoms break approximately 2 percent of the time during vaginal intercourse; a similar proportion slip off completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/89-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-93</a>]; however, these rates widely vary across some studies (0 to 22 percent for breakage; 0 to 9 percent for slippage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/89,94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,94,95</a>]. During anal intercourse, rates of breakage and slippage may be slightly higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/86,87,96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87,96,97</a>]. If a user complains of repeated breakage or slippage, review proper condom use with him or her.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Advise users to have several condoms available in case a condom is torn or put on incorrectly, falls off, or repeated intercourse is desired. Emergency contraception, now available over the counter without a prescription, can be used as a back-up method against pregnancy in case a condom breaks or falls off. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, immediately gently washing the penis, vulva, anus, and adjacent areas with soap and water may help to reduce the risk of acquiring an STI, although the effectiveness of this practice has not been well-studied. Inserting an applicator full of spermicide into the vagina as soon as possible may also help to prevent pregnancy. Women should not douche.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discuss use of lubricants and medications</strong> &mdash; Water-based lubricants (eg, K-Y, Astroglide, saliva, glycerine) and most silicone-based lubricants can be used with latex condoms, but oil-based lubricants reduce latex condom integrity and may facilitate breakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Common oil-based products that should not come into contact with latex condoms include baby oil, cold creams, edible oils (olive, peanut, corn, sunflower, canola, coconut), whipped cream, hand and body lotions, massage oil, petroleum jelly, rubbing alcohol, suntan oil and lotions, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a>.</p><p/><p>Clients should be aware of whether products they use (lubricants, medications) that come into contact with their condoms contain oil. This cannot be determined reliably by the look, feel, or characteristics (eg, water soluble) of the product. Spermicides are water-based. Other vaginal medications, however, often contain oil-based ingredients that can damage latex condoms (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=butoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">butoconazole</a> contains <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a>); therefore, clients using these medications should remain abstinent or use synthetic condoms until intravaginal medical therapy is fully completed. Oil-based products may be safely used with polyurethane and polyisoprene condoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During a World Health Organization Experts Meeting (Geneva, June 22 to 24, 2005) to develop a Global Handbook for Family Planning Providers, consensus was reached on five key condom instructions. These five messages, with minor modifications and additional explanation, follow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/1,26,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26,99</a>]:</p><p><strong>(1) Use a new condom for each act of intercourse if any risk of pregnancy or STI exists.</strong></p><p>Clients should discuss condom use with their partner before intercourse and should have an adequate supply of condoms readily available. Extra condoms will be needed if the first is damaged, torn before use, or put on incorrectly.</p><p>The condom package should be opened carefully to avoid damaging it with fingernails, teeth, or other sharp objects. Condoms in damaged packages or that show obvious signs of deterioration (brittleness, stickiness, or discoloration) should not be used.</p><p><strong>(2) Before any genital contact, place the condom on the tip of the erect penis with the rolled side out.</strong></p><p>Unrolling the condom a short distance helps to make sure the condom is being unrolled in the right direction. If the condom does not unroll easily, it is probably inside-out and should be discarded because flipping it over and using it could expose the partner to infectious organisms contained in the pre-ejaculate.</p><p><strong>(3) Unroll the condom all the way to the base of the erect penis.</strong></p><p>The condom should cover the penile glans and shaft.</p><p>Adequate, appropriate lubrication (natural or synthetic) is important before intercourse (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Strategies for promoting effective condom use'</a> above).</p><p><strong>(4) Immediately after ejaculation, hold the rim of the condom and withdraw the penis while it is still erect.</strong></p><p>The condom is held firmly against the base of the penis to prevent slippage and leakage of semen.</p><p><strong>(5) Throw away the used condom safely. Condoms should not be flushed down a toilet.</strong></p><p>After removing the condom, it should be checked for visible damage, and then wrapped in tissue and discarded. Condoms should not be reused.</p><p>A new condom should be used from &quot;beginning to end&quot; with each act of intercourse. If the condom breaks or falls off during intercourse but before ejaculation, it should be replaced with a new condom. New condoms should also be used for prolonged intercourse, and for different types of intercourse within a single session (eg, change the condom after anal sex if vaginal sex also is planned).</p><p>If the condom breaks, falls off, leaks, is damaged, or is not used, then pregnancy and infection are possible (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Strategies for promoting effective condom use'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">STORAGE AND EXPIRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Condoms should be stored in a cool and dry place, out of direct sunlight, as excessive heat will weaken latex. However, latex condoms can probably be carried, for convenience, in a wallet for up to one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-condoms/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>Clients should check the expiration or manufacture date on the box or individual package.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barrier-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Barrier methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condoms are made of latex rubber, natural membranes, or synthetic material. Latex accounts for approximately 80 percent of male condoms and has the advantages of low cost and protection from sexually transmitted diseases (including human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), as well as pregnancy, but can be damaged by oil-based lubricants. Natural membrane condoms contain small pores that may permit the passage of viruses; therefore, they are not recommended for STI prevention. Synthetic condoms provide an option for people who are allergic or sensitive to latex and should provide similar protection against pregnancy and STIs as latex condoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of condoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condoms prelubricated with spermicide are no more effective for STI prevention than other lubricated condoms, and have a higher cost and shorter shelf-life. We suggest avoiding this type of condom (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Spermicide coated condoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condom effectiveness depends on the motivation, skill level, and experience of the user. It is estimated that 2 percent of women will become pregnant during the first year of perfect (ie, consistent and correct) use of the condom, and about 18 percent of women will become pregnant during the first year of typical use. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Contraception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latex condom use provides protection from acquisition and transmission of sexually transmitted infections. In couples at risk, we recommend use of latex condoms (and synthetic condoms for latex sensitive or allergic persons) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Protection from STIs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate counseling and instruction can minimize problems with condom use. The most critical factors for protection from unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections are that a new condom is placed on the penis before any genital contact, remains intact until the penis is withdrawn, and is used with every act of intercourse. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Strategies for promoting effective condom use'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Instructions for use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The findings and conclusions in this topic review are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the USAID, NIH, or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3371017512\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Willard Cates, Jr, MD, MPH, who passed away in March 2016.
