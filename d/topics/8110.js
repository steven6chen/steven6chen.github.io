Ninety percent of cases occur in the pediatric age group. In contrast to other forms of systemic vasculitis, IgAV (HSP) is usually self-limited and is characterized by a tetrad of clinical manifestations that vary in their presence and order of presentation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable purpura in patients with neither thrombocytopenia nor coagulopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthralgia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal disease</p><p/><p>Management of IgAV (HSP) includes supportive care, symptomatic therapy, and targeted treatment to decrease the risk of complications. The management and prognosis of IgAV (HSP) are presented here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients with IgAV (HSP) recover spontaneously. Thus, care is primarily supportive and includes adequate hydration, rest, and symptomatic relief of pain.</p><p>Most patients may be cared for in the ambulatory setting. In these patients, therapy is directed toward adequate oral hydration and symptomatic relief. Edema of the lower extremities, buttocks, and genital area is improved with bed rest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevating the affected area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331352511\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic treatment for abdominal and joint pain in patients with IgAV (HSP) includes the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical experience and limited observational data suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids can relieve many of the manifestations of IgAV (HSP), including the rash, <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/arthralgias,</span> scrotal <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/orchitis,</span> and gastrointestinal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, glucocorticoids are not usually indicated for these manifestations, unless symptoms are severe, given the limited data and the potential side effects of the therapy. Patients with IgAV (HSP) who have gastrointestinal involvement, including bowel wall edema, may have disrupted absorption of enteral medications. Thus, failure of NSAIDs or oral glucocorticoids to benefit certain patients may be due to poor absorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331352878\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild-to-moderate pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized, controlled studies of the use of NSAIDs for symptomatic pain relief in patients with IgAV (HSP). However, there is no suggestion that the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a child with bowel vasculitis is increased by the use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Thus, we do not hesitate to use NSAIDs to control joint and abdominal pain in patients with IgAV (HSP). However, NSAIDs may be contraindicated in patients with active gastrointestinal bleeding or glomerulonephritis because of their effects on platelets and renal perfusion.</p><p>For symptomatic relief of pain in patients with IgAV (HSP), we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> divided into two doses per day, because of its ease of dosing. In adolescents and adults, a maximum total daily dose of 1500 mg may be used for a few days. For longer-term use, a maximum dose of 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is suggested. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ibuprofen</a> and other NSAIDs are equally effective and may be better tolerated in some patients, although ibuprofen requires more frequent dosing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331352884\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies show that glucocorticoid therapy shortens the duration of abdominal pain in patients with IgAV (HSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. However, glucocorticoids do not appear to otherwise impact the clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Thus, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, maximum dose of 60 to 80 mg per day) only in patients with symptoms significant enough to affect their oral intake, interfere with their ability to ambulate and perform activities of daily living, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> require hospitalization. In patients who cannot tolerate oral medications, we administer equivalent doses of parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (0.8 to 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, maximum dose of 64 mg per day). Intravenous methylprednisolone may be more beneficial early in the disease course, when patients have active gastrointestinal disease, due to submucosal edema and hemorrhage altering absorption of oral medications. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hospitalization'</a> below.)</p><p>When glucocorticoids are used for treating IgAV (HSP), it is important to remember that inflammation may be ameliorated, but the pathophysiology of the disease does not appear to be affected. Accordingly, the glucocorticoid dose must be lowered slowly, typically over four to eight weeks, to minimize the chance of precipitating a disease flare by overly aggressive medication tapering. In addition, patients who are treated with glucocorticoids for severe abdominal pain require particular vigilance since these medications can obscure the signs and symptoms of abdominal catastrophes associated with IgAV (HSP).

Frequent assessment of vital signs, urine output, and hematocrit, as well as serial abdominal examinations and stool examination for blood, are required.

Bowel vasculitis often cannot be diagnosed by examination alone. In such cases, diagnostic imaging is necessary. Abdominal ultrasonography is typically used because it can detect changes in bowel wall thickness, hematomas, peritoneal fluid, and intussusception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Contrast enema studies are not useful, because they may not detect small bowel intussusceptions, which are commonly seen in patients with IgAV (HSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte management is imperative in patients with decreased renal function. Patients who present with nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, or renal insufficiency are at increased risk for long-term renal morbidity.

The risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage resulting from bowel vasculitis has not been shown to increase when inhibitors of cyclooxygenase are used, and, therefore, these agents are not contraindicated in IgAV (HSP). When these medications fail, administration of glucocorticoids will generally result in a rapid resolution of the arthritis. Rarely, a brief hospitalization may be required in order to provide the medications needed to relieve the arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H331352511\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of glucocorticoids in patients with IgAV (HSP) is controversial. Although many clinicians describe a rapid symptomatic improvement in patients who receive glucocorticoids, it is questionable as to whether such treatment alters long-term clinical outcomes. In addition, there are potential side effects of glucocorticoid therapy, including the risk of obscuring the signs of compromised bowel viability if treatment is started after an intussusception has occurred, as well as masking signs of fever and pain. As a result, we do not recommend routine glucocorticoid therapy for patients with IgAV (HSP) to treat symptoms or prevent renal or gastrointestinal complications. (See <a href=\"#H331352511\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of pain'</a> above.)</p><p>Initial reported benefits of glucocorticoid therapy in preventing complications from a systematic review that included 3 randomized trials and 12 retrospective studies included decreased risk of intussusception, renal involvement, and recurrence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One subsequent retrospective cohort study found a decreased risk of gastrointestinal procedures (endoscopy, imaging, and surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, a prospective study of 223 children in Finland published after the systematic review found no effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> on the timing of the appearance of nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or on the clinical course during six months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis incorporating the results of this trial reported no differences in the risk of persistent kidney disease at 6 months (three studies) and 12 months (three studies) in children given prednisone for 14 to 28 days at presentation compared with those who received placebo or supportive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This analysis also found no benefit in using antiplatelet agents such as heparin to prevent persistent renal disease. Failure to demonstrate benefit may be an artifact of the low prevalence rate of complications and the small number of patients studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>].</p><p>Additional therapies for the treatment of recalcitrant disease are not well defined, but there are reports and case series that suggest benefits from medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. There are also reports of benefit from additional immunosuppression in cases of aggressive, recalcitrant disease, typically with renal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Management of renal disease in IgAV (HSP) is discussed in detail separately.

In the absence of significant renal disease, the initial episode of IgAV (HSP) typically resolves within one month.</p><p>In two-thirds of children, there are no recurrent episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>]. In the remaining one-third of patients, IgAV (HSP) recurs at least once, typically within four months of the initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/2,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22,23</a>]. Each subsequent episode has similar clinical findings but is generally milder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shorter in duration than the preceding one. In a single-center study involving 417 patients, approximately one-third of the patients had at least one relapse, with a median time to relapse of one month. Presence of an infectious trigger was associated with a lower likelihood of relapse, while the risk of relapse was higher when joint and gastrointestinal symptom were present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Recurrences are more common in patients with nephritis, in those with evidence of acute inflammation (eg, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), and in patients who received treatment with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These findings suggest that patients who have a more severe course of IgAV (HSP) are at increased risk of recurrence.</p><p>One retrospective review from Israel reported a longer mean interval time of 13.5 months between the first and second episode of IgAV (HSP) than was reported previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, there was no difference in clinical and laboratory findings between patients with recurrent disease and those without recurrence. The reasons for these differences between study results are unclear.</p><p>Morbidity in the initial phase of IgAV (HSP) is primarily a result of gastrointestinal complications, including intussusception and, less commonly, bowel ischemia, bowel perforation, or pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>The long-term morbidity in patients with IgAV (HSP) is a result of renal disease. The risk of chronic renal disease is increased in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The severity of renal involvement correlates with the severity of the initial renal presentation and histologic changes seen on renal biopsy. Risk factors for a worse renal prognosis include nephrotic-range proteinuria, elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, and certain histologic findings. The supportive data are discussed elsewhere.

Accordingly, all patients with IgAV (HSP) should be followed with urinalysis and blood pressure monitoring weekly or biweekly for the first one to two months after presentation. Results from one study suggested that home urine dipstick testing was adequate for detecting development of nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Once the disease appears to be subsiding, additional follow-up for urine and blood pressure monitoring should be scheduled monthly at first, then every other month until one year after the initial presentation. To identify patients who may develop late renal disease, continued screening (eg, urinalysis and blood pressure measurements) should be performed by the primary care clinician during subsequent annual well-child visits.

We use oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) for children or adults, with a maximum dose of 60 to 80 mg per day, or equivalent doses of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (0.8 to 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, maximum dose of 64 mg per day). Patients who are treated with glucocorticoids for severe abdominal pain require particular vigilance since these medications can obscure the signs and symptoms of abdominal catastrophes associated with IgAV (HSP). Glucocorticoids should be tapered slowly, by no more than 25 percent per week, lest symptoms relapse. (See <a href=\"#H331352884\" class=\"local\">'Severe pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalization is indicated in patients who fail to maintain oral hydration and require the administration of intravenous fluids. Inpatient management may also be necessary to manage patients who have significant gastrointestinal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, changes in mental status, severe joint involvement limiting ambulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> self-care, or evidence of significant renal disease (elevated creatinine, hypertension, or proteinuria). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not recommend empiric glucocorticoid administration to prevent renal or gastrointestinal complications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although prognosis is excellent in children with IgAV (HSP), a small minority of patients (&lt;1 percent) develop long-term complications, primarily renal disease. In adults, the risk of significant renal disease is increased. At present, there is no known therapeutic regimen to forestall development of renal involvement. Therapy for optimal control of IgAV (HSP)-related nephritis or nephrosis is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-renal-manifestations#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Renal manifestations&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have developed IgAV (HSP) should be seen in follow-up with screening for urinary abnormalities and elevated blood pressure to identify patients with significant and potentially progressive renal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jennette JC, Falk RJ, Bacon PA, et al. 2012 revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature of Vasculitides.
