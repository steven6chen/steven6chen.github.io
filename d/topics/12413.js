Planning hepatic resection needs to take into account the nature of the lesion and its location within the liver, the patient's anatomy, and the quality and volume of the liver tissue that will remain after resection. Perioperative outcomes for hepatic resection have improved due to better surgical techniques that take advantage of the segmental anatomy of the liver, improved techniques for control of bleeding, and improved intensive care. Hepatic resection that is performed in high-volume centers by specially trained hepatobiliary surgeons is associated with better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Surgical resection of the liver and complications of liver resection will be reviewed here. Specific management of pathologies that indicate a need for liver resection and disease-specific outcomes related to liver resection are discussed in separate topic reviews.

Liver regeneration is fundamental to the ability to perform more extensive hepatic resections. The mechanisms responsible for this capability are an area of active research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In an animal model, angiogenesis inhibitors severely suppressed hepatic regeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As more and more patients are treated with small molecule inhibitors, it is crucial that all members of a multidisciplinary team, both surgeons and medical oncologists, remain &quot;on the same page&quot; with regard to current therapeutic needs and future therapeutic plans.</p><p>Although the exact amount of hepatic tissue regenerated will vary from patient to patient, healthy livers can regenerate significant amounts of liver within weeks to months after resection. In a series of 91 patients, liver volumes were measured before and after liver resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At six months postoperatively, the volume of liver regenerated was linearly related to the resected volume, but the liver volume had not yet reached total preoperative liver volume. Some patients have insufficient regeneration and may experience functional liver failure if the liver remnant is too small. One small study suggested that liver regeneration in obese patients with body mass index &gt;30 may be slower than in non-obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H93290273\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p>Preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) prior to large volume hepatic resection can stimulate liver hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. We typically allow the liver to regenerate for four weeks after PVE before repeating liver imaging to calculate the predicted future liver remnant. If adequate future liver remnant (20 percent for completely normal liver, 30 percent for steatohepatitis or moderate chemotherapy exposure, or 40 percent for mild cirrhosis or major chemotherapy exposure) is confirmed on repeat liver imaging, we perform hepatic resection two weeks after re-imaging (ie, six weeks from PVE). The techniques of PVE are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H1124057405\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative PVE and other alternatives'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-portal-vein-embolization#H2772347224\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative portal vein embolization&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93290227\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR HEPATIC RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant tumor within the liver (primary or secondary) is the most common indication for hepatic resection. However, benign liver conditions, which can be congenital or acquired, may also require hepatic resection. Although hepatic trauma is most commonly managed conservatively, on occasion, hepatic resection may be required to definitively manage hemorrhage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93290252\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with underlying conditions of the liver known to predispose to malignancy are generally screened at a regular interval for the development of cancer with imaging studies (eg, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance) and serum markers (eg, alpha fetoprotein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In susceptible patients, a lesion that is clearly not a benign cyst should be considered malignant until proven otherwise, and dysplastic nodules are considered premalignant lesions and generally treated as malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy and can occur in the context of inherited (eg, hemochromatosis) or acquired (eg, chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic cirrhosis) preexisting conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In one large series, cholangiocarcinoma was the second most common malignant tumor for which hepatic resection was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of localized cholangiocarcinoma: Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The liver is a common site for metastasis from solid tumors. In selected patients with focal or isolated disease, resection of liver metastases is associated with low rates of major perioperative morbidity (approximately 3 percent) and mortality (approximately 4 percent) with good long-term results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Neuroendocrine lesions, primarily from the foregut, are another source of metastases that respond well to liver resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Resection of nondigestive endocrine, and noncolorectal, non-neuroendocrine tumor metastases (eg, breast, sarcoma, genitourinary, melanoma), has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].

However, less than one-half of patients are candidates for resection at the time of diagnosis because of advanced disease. Provided there is no evidence of disease elsewhere, options for hepatic resection in patients with gallbladder cancer include extended cholecystectomy (en bloc resection of the gallbladder and a rim of liver), re-resection of portions of segments IVb and V, and, less commonly, right hemihepatectomy.

Symptomatic lesions causing pain or discomfort can be resected with minimal margins, often laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Most asymptomatic lesions can be managed conservatively and will not require resection; however, some asymptomatic lesions, such as large or giant hemangiomas, and adenomas larger than 4 to 5 cm, warrant resection when anatomically feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Surgical resection may be necessary for source control in patients who are extremely ill but is rarely required and not considered the standard of care in most patients. In one study, aggressive local surgical resection for pyogenic abscess was found to be beneficial in patients with an APACHE II score of &ge;15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

For patients with less severe disease, the degree to which the underlying liver disease constitutes an absolute versus relative contraindication to hepatic resection depends upon the anticipated volume of liver remaining after resection (ie, future liver remnant [FLR]), the presence of medical comorbidities, and resources available in the event of perioperative liver failure, such as the availability and proximity of liver transplantation. Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores do not directly impact decision making related to liver resection but may be useful in counseling a patient when choosing between liver resection and transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In these cases, perioperative mortality after resection, death from primary disease, and risks associated with transplant need to be taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In retrospective reviews evaluating outcomes of patients undergoing liver resection, primarily resection of hepatocellular carcinoma or colorectal metastases, the risk of death increases with decreasing volumes of the future liver remnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/38,39,42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39,42-46</a>]. For patients with normal liver function, FLR &lt;20 percent increases the risk of liver failure and death following major hepatic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In a review of 300 patients undergoing extended hepatectomy, multivariate analysis found a significantly increased risk of mortality if the FLR was &le;20 percent (odds ratio 3.18, 95% CI 1.34-7.54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The incidence of postoperative liver insufficiency and death were significantly greater in those with an FLR &lt;20 percent compared with FLR 20.1 to 30 percent or FLR &gt;30 percent (liver insufficiency 34 versus 10 and 15 percent, respectively; death 11 versus 3 and 2 percent, respectively). Patients with mild-to-moderate underlying functional liver disease have further increases in the risk of liver failure and death if the future liver remnant is inadequate, but there are no firm guidelines to define what constitutes &quot;inadequate&quot; for specific populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. </p><p>We use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We consider cirrhotic patients with Child-Pugh (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>) class C and Child-Pugh class B with an FLR &lt;40 percent as absolutely unresectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Other Child-Pugh B (liver remnant &gt;40 percent) and some Child-Pugh A patients may be relatively unresectable. Portal vein embolization (PVE) to achieve FLR &gt;40 percent can, in select cases, allow for a reasonable attempt at resection. If FLR does not increase to over 40 percent in this patient population, then we do not offer resection. In some centers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> (ICG) clearance is performed to assess hepatic function. Normal ICG clearance at 15 minutes (ICG<sub>15</sub>) is 90 percent; clearance of &lt;60 percent indicates an extremely high risk of post-resection liver failure and mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not offer hepatic resection to patients with NASH who have an FLR &lt;30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. There are few data on the safety of hepatic resection in patients with NASH, but the FLR should be higher than in patients with normal liver tissue. It may be reasonable to stratify these patients as medium-risk or high-risk based upon the presence of additional comorbidities such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, or morbid obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. For NASH patients with an FLR &gt;30 percent and no other major comorbidities, it may be reasonable to offer liver resection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are candidates for hepatic resection but who are deemed to have an inadequate FLR, we suggest preoperative portal vein embolization. Preoperative portal vein embolization increases the volume of the FLR and may permit subsequent hepatic resection.

Documented extrahepatic disease is a contraindication to hepatic resection for many malignancies, but not for all. Inferior vena cava invasion is generally considered a contraindication to surgical intervention; however, hepatic vein invasion away from the inferior vena cava, although suggestive of aggressive tumor biology, is not an absolute contraindication. Disease-specific contraindications to hepatic resection are discussed in separate topic reviews. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124058604\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We obtain a preoperative imaging study on all patients prior to elective hepatic resection to evaluate the potential margins of resection, which will determine the volume of the future liver remnant (ie, anticipated volume of liver remaining after resection) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F93783\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93783 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

At some institutions, this will be computed tomography (CT) and, at others, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); either is a reasonable choice provided the study is performed with appropriately thin-slice images and a properly timed intravenous contrast bolus. The most experienced radiologist available with the chosen modality should provide the interpretation, and the surgeon should also be comfortable interpreting the images. Although thin-slice CT is more commonly used, MRI may surpass CT in clinical utility as it becomes more time efficient, cost effective, and readily available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>We generally determine future liver remnant using CT volumetry in consultation with a radiologist. MRI volumetry provides similar information. The volume of the remnant liver (FLV) will be according to the equation FLV = (future liver volume <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> total estimated liver volume) &times; 100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Although there are numerous equations used to estimate liver volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>], we prefer to utilize the equation method to calculate the total estimated liver volume and not measure the total liver volume with imaging.</p><p>Multiphase CT includes noncontrast, arterial, venous, and portal phases and should also include volumetric analysis of the future liver remnant. The arterial phase should identify important arterial anatomy and any aberrant vessels (such as replaced arteries) and define the relationship of intrahepatic tumor to critical vascular or biliary structures. Omitting the portal venous phase increases the risk of missing small, isodense hepatocellular carcinoma lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Although other imaging modalities such as ultrasound, positive emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may be useful adjuncts in management, poor resolution limits their usefulness for defining anatomy in planning hepatic resection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124057405\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE PVE AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) is a valuable adjunct to major liver resection, particularly for right-sided tumors.

These considerations are discussed in the sections above.

Preoperative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, most often heparin (5000 units subcutaneous injection), is recommended for moderate- and high-risk patients based on the patient and the liver function.

We have found that the benefits of epidural analgesia for postoperative pain outweigh the risks associated with liver resection, but the choice to proceed requires close collaboration with the medical providers managing the epidural catheter, usually an acute pain consulting service or the anesthesia providers.

The types of hepatic resection include wedge resection, segmental resection (sectionectomy, sectorectomy), hepatectomy (right or left), and extended hepatectomy (right or left) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66282\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66282 \">figure 2</a>). Each of these (except wedge resection) constitutes anatomic resection based upon the segmental anatomy of the liver according to Couinaud (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 1</a>), but alternatively, nonanatomic resection can be performed. For most resections, cholecystectomy is performed followed by dissection of the porta hepatis to isolate and control the vascular and ductal structures. Thereafter, the liver tissue is divided to the extent that is mandated by the type of liver resection being undertaken, and hemostasis achieved prior to abdominal closure. The general techniques used for hepatic resection and the manner in which specific resections are performed are discussed elsewhere.

However, nonanatomic resection may be needed if anatomic resection will result in inadequate residual liver volume to support recovery, such as in the patient with cirrhosis. More bleeding may occur with nonanatomic resection, which is a disadvantage of this technique; however, inflow occlusion can be used to reduce blood loss.

If the resection can be accomplished en bloc, we believe it is reasonable to resect such a tumor.

Benign lesions, such as hemangiomas, adenomas, complex cysts, and fibronodular hyperplasia, can be excised by enucleation or resection with limited margins. </p><p>Data to guide the margin of hepatic tumor resection are relatively sparse. We suggest a margin of at least 1 cm when resecting malignant tumor. A margin of 2 cm may be even more desirable for aggressive tumor biology, but this is frequently not possible. As an example, for tumor in proximity to major vascular structures, a resection margin of only a few millimeters may be all that can be achieved. </p><p>For resecting colorectal metastases, some have suggested that a negative margin as little as 1 mm (compared with a traditional 1-cm margin) is adequate, but this is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/70-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-73</a>]. Studies evaluating outcomes using greater or lesser margins have been confounded by a greater proportion of patients for whom a lesser margin was used because of multiple metastases or synchronous bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. It is possible that other types of metastatic lesions could be treated similarly to colorectal metastases, but until more evidence is available for other specific types of liver metastases, we prefer at least a 50mm tumor-free margin, if at all possible.

In the immediate postoperative period, hyperglycemia and coagulation abnormalities are relatively common. We aggressively monitor and control blood sugar and correct abnormal coagulation parameters, as described below. Hypophosphatemia, potentially related to increased phosphate uptake by regenerating liver cells, occurs in nearly all patients following major hepatic resection and should be corrected as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

For patients with malignancy, we continue to follow up every six months to assess for recurrent disease, or new metastatic disease to the liver. </p><p>In cases of early recurrence, or the unfortunate occurrence of a positive margin, whether or not to proceed with a second (ie, re-resection) becomes a complex decision that is rarely encountered. The same considerations that are discussed above for primary resection should also be applied. Re-resection can be considered for patients with primary liver tumors or metastatic liver tumors, but only for patients with no metastatic disease outside the liver. There must be adequate hypertrophy of the liver after the first resection, and the resection should be anatomically feasible based upon the location of the recurrent disease. Fundamentally, prior to re-resection, the patient's liver function (and other comorbidities) as well as functional status should have returned to baseline.

In a study of 222 patients without preoperative portal vein thrombosis who underwent hepatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>], the incidence of postoperative portal vein thrombosis was 9.1 percent. Multivariate analysis identified right hepatectomy as a significant independent risk factor for main portal vein thrombosis (odds ratio 109, 95% CI 11-2906). Patients with peripheral portal vein thrombosis had a significantly longer duration of the Pringle maneuver than patients without portal vein thrombosis (76 versus 43 minutes). Patients were selectively anticoagulated depending on extent of thrombus, effect on portal flow, and risk for bleeding. Among those who were anticoagulated, portal vein thrombosis resolved in all patients after a mean treatment period of 1.6 months (total mean duration of therapy 4.6 months).</p><p>Symptoms of portal vein thrombosis are often vague and may be obscured by postoperative pain, but sharp increases in liver function tests should raise suspicion for portal vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. If there is any concern for a thrombotic complication, we suggest imaging evaluation (Doppler ultrasound or computed tomography of the abdomen) to assess portal venous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatic artery flow. Portal vein or hepatic artery thrombosis may require reoperation.

One clinically useful definition of PHLF is impairment in the liver's ability to maintain its synthetic, excretory and detoxifying functions as characterized by an increased international normalized ratio (INR) and hyperbilirubinemia on or after postoperative day 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

The main risk factors for PHLF are underlying functional liver disease and an insufficient volume of the residual liver remnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatic-resection/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>].

However, preoperative pressures are not readily available, and thus, proper patient selection and preparation remains the most effective means of prevention. The importance of an adequate future liver remnant cannot be overly stressed.

Malignant tumor within the liver (primary or secondary) is the most common indication for hepatic resection. Benign liver conditions that require hepatic resection are usually symptomatic and can be congenital or acquired. Hepatic trauma is most commonly managed conservatively, but on occasion will require hepatic resection to definitively manage hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H93290227\" class=\"local\">'Indications for hepatic resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing hepatic resection involves medical assessment and imaging studies to determine the location of the lesion, potential margins of resection, and the expected volume of functional liver following resection (ie, future liver remnant). Together, these will determine if resection is feasible and, if so, the type and extent of the resection. (See <a href=\"#H93289684\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with future liver remnant &lt;20 percent of the total volume of the liver, we suggest <strong>not</strong> performing hepatic resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Perioperative morbidity and mortality is significantly increased with lesser volumes. The risk of liver failure and death is further increased for patients with underlying liver dysfunction (eg, cirrhosis, steatohepatitis), such that an even larger volume of future liver remnant is required. (See <a href=\"#H93290273\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1498479792\" class=\"local\">'Liver function and regeneration after resection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a future liver remnant that contraindicates hepatic resection, we suggest preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). PVE stimulates liver hyperplasia in the remnant liver. In patients with certain malignancies, PVE has improved survival and reduced rates of postoperative liver failure following more extensive hepatic resections. (See <a href=\"#H1124057405\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative PVE and other alternatives'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-portal-vein-embolization#H1401867828\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative portal vein embolization&quot;, section on 'Disease-specific outcomes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-portal-vein-embolization#H2772347224\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative portal vein embolization&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend prophylactic antibiotics prior to incision in patients undergoing hepatic resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The specific agent given should take into account the indication for the procedure (eg, tumor, infection) and any additional surgical procedures (eg, cholecystectomy, colectomy) that will be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1124057442\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For malignant liver lesions, we suggest a margin of at least 1 cm rather than a lesser amount, whenever possible (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A margin greater than 2 cm may be desirable for aggressive tumor biology, but this is frequently not possible, and for some tumors, a lesser margin may be appropriate. Benign lesions (hemangiomas, adenomas, complex cysts, fibronodular hyperplasia) can be excised by enucleation or resection with limited margins. (See <a href=\"#H29898048\" class=\"local\">'Resection margins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At high-volume centers, surgical mortality following hepatic resection is 1 to 3 percent and is highest among patients with underlying liver disease. In patients with no evidence of diffuse liver disease and minimal comorbidities, liver failure is uncommon following limited resections (ie, adequate liver remnant). Long-term survival depends upon the specific pathology for which the hepatic resection was performed. Complications of any kind occur in up to 40 percent of patients without cirrhosis, with a higher incidence in patients with some degree of cirrhosis. Major complications include bile leak, coagulopathy and postoperative bleeding, hyperglycemia, and liver failure.
