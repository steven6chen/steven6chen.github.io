You might get slightly different numbers depending on how you take your temperature &ndash; oral (mouth), armpit, ear, forehead, or rectal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H580209394\"><span class=\"h1\">What is the best way to take my temperature?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Armpit, ear, and forehead temperatures are easier to measure than rectal or oral temperatures, but they are not as accurate.</p><p>Here is the right way to take an oral temperature:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wait at least 30 minutes after you eat or drink anything hot or cold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash the thermometer with cool water and soap. Then rinse it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the tip of the thermometer under your tongue toward the back. Hold the thermometer with your lips, not your teeth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your lips closed around the thermometer. A glass thermometer takes about 3 minutes to work. Most digital thermometers take less than 1 minute.</p><p/><p>The height of the temperature is less important than how sick you feel. If you think you have a fever and you feel sick, your doctor or nurse might want you to double-check by getting an oral or rectal temperature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H580209411\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes fever?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of fever in adults is infection. Common infections that can cause fever include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cold or the flu</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An airway infection, such as bronchitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stomach bug</p><p/><p>Most of these infections are not serious and get better on their own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H580209426\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if you get a fever and you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are pregnant</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recently got back from a trip to Africa, Asia, Latin America, or the Middle East</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Just got out of the hospital, or had surgery or another medical procedure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get infections often</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are on chemotherapy &ndash; Call your doctor or nurse if your oral temperature goes above 100.4&ordm;F (38.0&ordm;C) for more than 1 hour. Also call if it goes above 101&ordm;F (38.3&ordm;C) even just 1 time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines that suppress the body's infection fighting system, also called the &quot;immune system&quot; &ndash; Examples of these medicines include steroids and medicines used to prevent rejection after organ transplant.</p><p/><p>You should also call if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever that lasts several days or keeps coming back</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A recent bite from an insect called a tick &ndash; Infections you can catch from tick bites can cause fever and other symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serious health condition, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, lupus, or sickle cell anemia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever plus 1 or more of these symptoms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe headache or neck pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seizure or confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe vomiting or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe pain in the belly, back, or sides</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any other symptom that is unusual or worries you</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H580209441\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and talk with you about your symptoms. You might also have the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest X-ray or CT scan &ndash; These imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse will talk to you about any other tests you might need.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H580209456\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can stay home, rest, and drink plenty of fluids. You can also take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) to relieve fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H580209471\"><span class=\"h1\">How are fevers treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on the cause. Many people do not need treatment. If you do, treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics to fight the infection. But antibiotics only work on infections caused by bacteria, not infections caused by viruses. For example, antibiotics will <strong>not</strong> work on a cold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin). These medicines can help bring down a fever. But they are not always necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H580209153\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-gastroenteritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Viral gastroenteritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neutropenia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neutropenia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neutropenia-and-fever-in-people-being-treated-for-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neutropenia and fever in people being treated for cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-you-should-know-about-antibiotics-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What you should know about antibiotics (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-mono-in-adults-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Infectious mononucleosis (mono) in adults and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
