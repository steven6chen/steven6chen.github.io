Assessing initial asthma severity in children younger than 12 years of age, determining when to start daily controller therapy, and assessing and monitoring control to determine if therapy modifications are needed are discussed here.</p><p>Our approach to the management of asthma in children is based upon the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert panel guidelines, published in 2007, that provide recommendations for the management of chronic childhood asthma in children aged 0 to 4 years and 5 to 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initiating-therapy-and-monitoring-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Initial assessment of patients who have confirmed asthma begins with a severity classification because selection of the type, amount, and scheduling of therapy corresponds to the level of asthma severity. This assessment is made immediately after diagnosis, or when the patient is first encountered, generally before the patient is taking some form of long-term controller medication. Asthma severity does not predict the severity of exacerbations. Even children with mild asthma can have severe exacerbations.

As an example, a child who has symptoms approximately four days per week, uses short-acting beta agonists approximately three days per week, has minor limitations in normal activities, and has had only one course of oral glucocorticoids for an exacerbation in the past year (all categorized as &quot;mild&quot;), but has had nighttime awakenings four times a month (categorized as &quot;moderate&quot;) is considered to have asthma of moderate severity.</p><p>If the assessment is made during a visit in which the patient is treated for an acute exacerbation, then asking the patient to recall symptoms and short-acting beta agonist use in the period before the onset of the current exacerbation will suffice to determine impairment until the following visit.

Other factors, including the risk of developing persistent asthma, are also taken into consideration in children under five years of age. Patients with intermittent asthma require only occasional use of quick-relief medications, whereas patients with persistent asthma of any severity should be started on daily controller therapy.

Thus, the Joint Task Force of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society also recommend defining asthma severity as the degree of difficulty in achieving asthma control while on daily controller treatment in addition to the components of severity discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initiating-therapy-and-monitoring-control/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

As an example, exposure to violence is associated with more symptom days and higher hospitalization rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initiating-therapy-and-monitoring-control/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Patients with severe asthma can include those who are untreated, who are difficult to treat, and who are maximally treated but resistant to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initiating-therapy-and-monitoring-control/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Medication side effects may impact adherence. In addition, significant side effects may necessitate a change in medications even if the patient&rsquo;s asthma is well controlled. The presence of persistent asthma symptoms (impairment domain) is a risk factor for severe asthma exacerbations (risk domain), although the predictors for each are different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initiating-therapy-and-monitoring-control/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK) questionnaire is validated for preschool-aged children. This tool assesses impairment of asthma control (symptom burden, activity limitations, and rescue use of bronchodilators) and is the first to also assess risk (oral glucocorticoid use in the past 12 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initiating-therapy-and-monitoring-control/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The Asthma APGAR (<strong>A</strong>ctivities, <strong>P</strong>ersistent tri<strong>G</strong>gers, <strong>A</strong>sthma medications, <strong>R</strong>esponse to therapy) system includes a <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/parent-completed</span> questionnaire and an algorithm that uses the questionnaire answers to guide asthma care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initiating-therapy-and-monitoring-control/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The questionnaire collects information on &quot;actionable items,&quot; such as asthma triggers, treatment adherence, inhaler technique, and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/parent</span> perception of response to treatment, in addition to assessment of control. The Asthma APGAR system was found to similarly assess asthma control compared with the ACT. It appears to be a promising tool that provides additional guidance to aid clinicians in improving asthma care, although further study of this system is needed before it is used routinely in clinical care.</p><p>Pulmonary function testing is recommended to assess asthma control (in children able to perform the technique adequately), in addition to a careful assessment of symptoms and medication use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initiating-therapy-and-monitoring-control/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>].

Other factors, including the risk of developing persistent asthma, are also taken into consideration in children under five years of age. Patients with intermittent asthma require only occasional use of quick-relief medications, whereas patients with persistent asthma of any severity should be started on daily controller therapy.

This includes evaluation of the components of <strong>impairment</strong> and <strong>risk</strong> that are reviewed above, as well as assessment for treatment-related adverse effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78322%7EPULM%2F64986\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78322 graphicRef64986 \">table 2A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be reevaluated after initiation of controller therapy to determine its effectiveness. Treatment with controller medications may be escalated (step up) at any time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78322%7EPULM%2F64986\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78322 graphicRef64986 \">table 2A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76669%7EPULM%2F67459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76669 graphicRef67459 \">figure 1A-B</a>), although adherence with the current regimen should be assessed before escalating therapy. Attempts should be made to reduce the regimen (step down) once asthma control has been achieved for at least three months. The frequency of follow-up is determined by the severity of asthma and level of control.
