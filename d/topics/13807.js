When people have this rash, they often say, &quot;I got poison ivy.&quot;</p><p>The same substance that causes the poison ivy rash is also found in poison oak, poison sumac, the ginkgo fruit, and mango peels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542163495\"><span class=\"h1\">How did I get poison ivy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might have gotten poison ivy if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touched a poison ivy plant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touched something that had the plant's oils on it (such as clothing, animal fur, or garden tools)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were nearby when poison ivy plants were being burned</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542163502\"><span class=\"h1\">What does poison ivy look like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poison ivy and poison oak have 3 leaves coming off a single stem. That's why there is a saying, &quot;leaves of 3, let them be.&quot; The leaves start out green, but they can turn red or brown. Even dead plants can cause the rash (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79136 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542163509\"><span class=\"h1\">What will happen to my rash?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your rash should go away within 1 to 3 weeks, but it might form blisters before it does. Blisters are little bubbles of skin that are filled with fluid. They can show up in different places at different times. But that does not mean that the rash is spreading. Touching the blisters or the fluid inside the blisters will not spread the rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542163516\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to relieve the itching?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid scratching (that makes the itch worse)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try putting a cold, wet cloth or paper towels on your rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calamine-lotion-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">calamine lotion</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your blisters have started to pop, use skin products that have <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-acetate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aluminum acetate</a> in them (examples include Burrow's solution and Domeboro)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542163523\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your rash is severe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most of your body is affected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your face or genitals are affected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a lot of swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are not sure that you have poison ivy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your rash oozes pus or gives other signs of being infected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your rash does not get better after 2 to 3 weeks</p><p/><p>If you have a very bad rash, your doctor or nurse can prescribe medicines called steroids. These medicines can reduce swelling and relieve itching. Steroids come in creams, ointments, and pills. Your doctor or nurse will decide what form you should use.</p><p>Steroid creams and ointments are also sold without a prescription.
