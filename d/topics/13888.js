Other less common causes of portal hypertension include noncirrhotic portal hypertension and extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis.

Some of the variability in prevalence estimates may be related to the study of different patient populations and variable definitions of PHG used in different studies. In one of the larger studies that included 1016 patients with severe hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis who had no prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding, PHG was detected in 37 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>PHG appears to be more common in patients with advanced liver disease, more severe portal hypertension, esophageal varices, or a history of treatment for esophageal varices with sclerotherapy or band ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/4-6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60159191\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portal hypertension is a prerequisite for the development of portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). The pathogenesis of PHG may be related to both congestion and hyperemia in the stomach. This is supported by the finding that gastric mucosal blood flow is increased in patients with cirrhosis and PHG compared with those without PHG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other possible mechanisms include mucosal ischemia and increased nitric oxide synthase activity or inflammation associated with abnormal blood flow due to portal hypertension, but their etiologic role is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The severity of gastropathy is related to portal pressure, the level of hepatic vascular resistance, and the degree of reduction in hepatic perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Some studies have suggested that endoscopic sclerotherapy or ligation of esophageal varices increases the risk of developing PHG, though this issue remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It has been hypothesized that variceal obliteration results in hyperdynamic congestion, which then gives rise to PHG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a prospective series with 107 patients with portal hypertension from various causes who were studied before and after sclerotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], PHG was evident in 4 of 35 patients with cirrhosis before sclerotherapy. After sclerotherapy, 21 additional patients (20 percent) developed PHG during a follow-up of 23 months. The risk of developing PHG appeared to be influenced by prior sclerotherapy, the severity of liver disease, the etiology of portal hypertension, and the coexistence of gastric varices, but the risk was not directly correlated with intravariceal pressure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325152467\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) are often asymptomatic and are diagnosed when endoscopy is performed for other reasons (eg, to screen for esophageal varices) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, because the gastric mucosa in the setting of PHG is friable, bleeding may occur when ectatic vessels rupture (though PHG is an uncommon cause of significant bleeding in patients with portal hypertension). When bleeding occurs it is typically chronic, though it can be acute and massive. Patients with chronic bleeding may have occult blood in their stool <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> iron deficiency anemia. Patients with acute bleeding may present with hematemesis, melena, or if the bleeding is massive, hematochezia. </p><p>Chronic bleeding is estimated to develop in 3 to 60 percent of patients with PHG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/3,4,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,15,16</a>], and acute bleeding is estimated to occur in 2 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Among patients with acute bleeding, the majority (90 to 95 percent) have severe PHG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H325153350\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> below.)</p><p>The natural history of PHG has been evaluated in prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. One study included 315 patients who were followed with clinical and endoscopic examinations every six months for three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. During follow-up, endoscopic PHG remained stable in 29 percent, worsened in 23 percent, improved in 23 percent, and fluctuated in 25 percent. Acute bleeding from PHG was observed in only eight patients (2.5 percent), with one death. Chronic bleeding occurred in 34 patients (11 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60159197\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325153498\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) should be suspected in patients with risk factors for portal hypertension who have signs of acute or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. If PHG is suspected, patients should undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. PHG should also be suspected in patients with portal hypertension who are undergoing endoscopy for other reasons and have characteristic endoscopic findings (a mosaic-like or &quot;snakeskin&quot; appearance of the gastric mucosa, predominantly in the fundus and body). Mucosal biopsies can safely be obtained if the diagnosis is unclear; however, care should be taken in the setting of coagulopathy. Diagnostic uncertainty most often occurs when gastrointestinal vascular ectasia (GAVE) is also being considered in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H325152531\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325153671\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PHG is typically diagnosed endoscopically. PHG characteristically appears as a fine, white, reticular pattern separating areas of pinkish mucosa, giving the gastric mucosa a snakeskin appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F105554\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105554 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other findings may include flat or bulging red marks or red spots that resemble vascular ectasias, or black-brown spots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Mucosal changes are usually most evident in the fundus and body (proximal part) of the stomach. In more severe cases, oozing, bleeding, subepithelial hemorrhages, and increased vascularity similar to angiomas are evident, often involving the gastric fundus, gastric body, and antrum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325153492\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsies are generally not needed to make a diagnosis of PHG because the combination of the appropriate clinical setting and endoscopic appearance of the lesion is usually sufficient. If biopsies are obtained because of a suspicion of PHG, care should be taken if there is any evidence of coagulopathy. If biopsies are obtained, the histologic findings include dilated submucosal and mucosal veins and ectatic capillaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Findings such as inflammation and thrombi are absent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325153350\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PHG is typically categorized as either mild or severe, though there are classification systems that include a moderate category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Mild PHG is characterized by a mosaic-like pattern without other findings. Severe PHG is characterized by a mosaic-like pattern with flat or bulging red or black-brown spots, or by active hemorrhage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325152531\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325153769\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for patients with chronic bleeding encompasses lesions throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including peptic ulcer disease, angiodysplasia, and malignancies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69451 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F103148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103148 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The evaluation of occult bleeding includes upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and possibly evaluation of the small bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F94181\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94181 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Upper endoscopy permits differentiation among these different bleeding sources (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F103148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103148 \">table 2</a>).

It is important to differentiate between the two entities because they are treated differently. GAVE is treated with thermoablative therapy, whereas PHG is treated with measures aimed at reducing portal pressure. Findings that favor a diagnosis of GAVE include an antral-predominant location of the lesions and a classic linear pattern of lesions. In situations where the diagnosis remains unclear, histological analysis may be helpful. Histologic findings that suggest GAVE include extensive vascular ectasia, spindle cell proliferation, fibrin thrombi, and fibrohyalinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The use of PPIs in this setting remains controversial, but because acid is not likely to play a major role in patients with bleeding from PHG, the PPI can be discontinued unless it is indicated for another reason.</p><p>The efficacy of vasoconstrictors for acute bleeding from PHG was demonstrated in a trial of 68 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Bleeding was controlled in all 24 of the patients who received octreotide, in 14 of 22 (64 percent) of the patients who received vasopressin, and in 13 of 22 (59 percent) of patients who received omeprazole. In a second trial with 86 patients with bleeding from PHG or varices, those who received higher doses of terlipressin had better bleeding control and lower recurrence rates than patients who received lower doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertensive-gastropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Because PHG is a diffuse process, endoscopic therapy is typically not effective. However, endoscopic thermal coagulation may be effective for patients with focally bleeding lesions. Banding, injection therapy, H2 blockers, and topical agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> are ineffective for controlling diffuse bleeding or for preventing rebleeding from extensive PHG.

The choice of therapy will depend on local expertise with TIPS placement and surgical shunting and whether the patient is a candidate for liver transplantation. However, not all patients with refractory bleeding will require such invasive intervention. Patients with less severe chronic bleeding may be adequately managed with iron repletion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary and pre-primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Nonselective beta blockers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Oral iron'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Intravenous iron'</a>.)</p><p>Information on the efficacy of TIPS placement for PHG is limited.

Endoscopic improvement in patients with mild PHG was visible within six weeks in most patients and by three to six months in approximately 85 percent of patients.

(See <a href=\"#H325153004\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PHG are often asymptomatic and are diagnosed when endoscopy is performed for other reasons (eg, to screen for esophageal varices). Bleeding is typically chronic, though it can be acute and massive in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H325152467\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PHG should be suspected in patients with risk factors for portal hypertension who have symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of acute or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Patients with evidence of UGIB should undergo upper GI endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. PHG should also be suspected in patients with portal hypertension who are undergoing endoscopy for other reasons and have characteristic endoscopic findings (a mosaic-like or &quot;snakeskin&quot; appearance of the gastric mucosa, especially in the cardia, fundus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> body). Biopsies may be required if the diagnosis is unclear (especially if gastric antral vascular ectasia is also being considered in the differential diagnosis). (See <a href=\"#H60159197\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PHG is most commonly categorized endoscopically as either mild or severe. Mild PHG is characterized by a mosaic-like pattern without other findings. Severe PHG is characterized by a mosaic-like pattern with flat or bulging red or black-brown spots, or by active hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H325153350\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An overview of the management of PHG is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F103137\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103137 \">table 3</a>). In general, the management of PHG is directed at decreasing portal pressure. (See <a href=\"#H60159209\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Primary prophylaxis</strong>: In patients with severe PHG and other risk factors for GI bleeding (eg, a coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia), we suggest primary prophylaxis with a nonselective beta blocker rather than giving no prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Nonselective beta blockers should also be started in patients who have other indications for nonselective beta blocker therapy (eg, varices). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Carvedilol</a> is an alternative for patients who cannot take beta blockers or do not tolerate them. For all other patients, we suggest <strong>not</strong> giving primary prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H325153879\" class=\"local\">'Primary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Chronic bleeding</strong>: Patients with chronic bleeding should receive iron <span class=\"nowrap\">repletion/blood</span> transfusions as needed. In addition, we suggest that patients with chronic bleeding also receive treatment with a nonselective beta blocker rather than treatment with iron <span class=\"nowrap\">repletion/blood</span> transfusions alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Carvedilol</a> is an alternative for patients who cannot take beta blockers or do not tolerate them. If medical therapy is successful at controlling the bleeding, the medication should be continued indefinitely. (See <a href=\"#H325153906\" class=\"local\">'Chronic bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Acute bleeding</strong>: Patients with acute bleeding should be managed the same as patients with other causes of UGIB. Management includes <span class=\"nowrap\">resuscitation/blood</span> transfusion as necessary, upper endoscopy, and, for patients with cirrhosis, antibiotic prophylaxis. For patients known to have PHG, we suggest additional treatment with a vasoactive medication (eg, terlipressin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>) rather than supportive measures alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This suggestion is based both on studies that have looked at the use of vasoactive medications in patients with acute bleeding from PHG, as well as the efficacy of vasoactive medications in patients with bleeding from other complications of portal hypertension. Vasoactive medications should also be given to patients with known or suspected varices. Once the bleeding is controlled, a nonselective beta blocker is started and continued indefinitely. (See <a href=\"#H325154118\" class=\"local\">'Acute bleeding'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage#H62477588\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Refractory bleeding</strong>: For patients who fail to respond to initial therapy, further treatment options include transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, shunt surgery, and liver transplantation. The choice of therapy will depend on local expertise with TIPS placement and surgical shunting and whether the patient is a liver transplant candidate. However, not all patients with refractory bleeding will require invasive treatment. Patients with less severe chronic bleeding may be adequately managed with iron repletion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood transfusion.
