Doctors call this condition &quot;AR&quot; for short.</p><p>When the heart valves work normally, they keep blood flowing in only 1 direction. The valves work like swinging doors that open only 1 way &ndash; they let blood out, but not back in. Normally, little or no blood is able to leak backward. But if the valves are not working properly, blood can go back in the direction it came from.</p><p>The aortic valve normally keeps blood flowing from the left ventricle to the aorta (the large blood vessel that carries blood to the body). When the aortic valve leaks, it lets blood flow back into the left ventricle. Over time, this can lead to problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19548840\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes aortic regurgitation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, AR is caused by either:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diseased or damaged aortic valve</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Widening of the first part of the aorta (the part that surrounds the aortic valve)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19548855\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of aortic regurgitation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early on, most people have no symptoms. They find out they have AR when their doctor or nurse hears a heart murmur on a routine exam. A heart murmur is an extra sound in the heartbeat that doctors or nurses hear when they listen to the heart with a stethoscope.</p><p>When AR causes symptoms, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart palpitations, which feel like the heart is pounding, beating hard or fast, or skipping beats. People might notice this more when they lie down or lie on their left side.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19548874\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for aortic regurgitation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and order 1 or more tests. The test done most often to check for AR is an echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;). This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats. It shows the size of the heart chambers, how well the heart pumps, and how well the heart valves work (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 2</a>). Your doctor might repeat this test over time to check whether your condition changes.</p><p>You might have a test called an electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;). This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>To get more information about your heart, your doctor might order a test called cardiac catheterization, or &quot;cardiac cath.&quot; For this, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77943\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77943 \">figure 4</a>). When the tube is in your heart or blood vessels, he or she will take measurements. Next, the doctor puts a dye that shows up on X-ray into the tube. This can show how much the aortic valve is leaking. The doctor might also use a tube to put dye in the arteries in your heart. This can show if any of them are narrowed or blocked.</p><p>Some people with aortic regurgitation will also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; This can show the size and shape of your heart and aorta.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test, such as an MRI &ndash; This can show more detail about how much the aortic valve is leaking, and the size and shape of your heart and aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19548940\"><span class=\"h1\">How is aortic regurgitation treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms and how severe they are, and what's causing your AR. If your AR is mild or you have no symptoms, you might not need treatment right away. But your doctor will monitor your symptoms to see if and when they get worse.</p><p>The main treatment for AR that is severe or causes symptoms is surgery to replace the aortic valve. During surgery, the doctor will remove the diseased valve and replace it with a valve that works normally. In some cases, the doctor will also fix a widened part of the aorta during surgery.</p><p>Other treatment depends on a person's individual situation. It might include heart medicines or treatment for high blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19548955\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I play sports?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your AR and symptoms, the size of your aorta, and your other conditions. You and your doctor should discuss the level of physical activity that is right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19548970\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to take antibiotics before I go to the dentist?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, no. In the past, doctors recommended that people with AR take antibiotics before going to the dentist or having certain medical or dental procedures. But now, only people with certain heart conditions need antibiotics before going to the dentist or having a procedure. Most people with AR do not need antibiotics for those times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19548985\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor before you start trying. He or she might recommend treatment for your AR before you get pregnant. He or she will also make sure that any medicines you take are safe to take during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19549000\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-valves-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prosthetic valves (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cardiac catheterization (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=marfan-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Marfan syndrome (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
