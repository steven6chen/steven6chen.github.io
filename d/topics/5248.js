In a study of 1500 patients presenting to a thyroid practice, the prevalence of malignancy was 2.8, 3.7, 8.3, 12.3, and 29.7 percent for patients with serum TSH concentrations &lt;0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> 0.4 to 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> 1 to 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> 1.8 to 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> and &gt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The routine use of thyroid ultrasound as a screening tool to detect nonpalpable thyroid cancers in patients without known or suspected thyroid nodules is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>].</p><p>Thyroid ultrasonography is used to answer questions about the size and anatomy of the thyroid gland and adjacent structures in the neck.

In a retrospective study of 173 patients referred to a thyroid nodule clinic for an abnormal thyroid examination, the ultrasound findings were different from the physical examination done by the referring clinician in 63 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Of the 114 patients referred for a solitary nodule, 24 percent had additional nodules and 20 percent did not have a nodule of at least 1 cm that required aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H1586261\" class=\"local\">'Sonographic criteria for FNA'</a> below.)</p><p>There are several ultrasonographic findings that are suspicious for thyroid cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68199 \">table 2</a>). The predictive value of these characteristics varies widely, and we do not rely on thyroid ultrasound to diagnose cancer or to select patients for surgery. However, ultrasound findings can be used to select nodules for FNA biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H1586261\" class=\"local\">'Sonographic criteria for FNA'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;, section on 'Criteria for identifying cancer'</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasound can identify posteriorly located nodules or predominantly cystic nodules. The diagnostic accuracy of FNA performed by palpation is reduced in these nodules, and ultrasound-guided FNA is more effective (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy#H27370272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy&quot;, section on 'Indications for ultrasound-guided FNA'</a>). Apparent nodularity in Hashimoto's thyroiditis may represent focal enlargement from lymphocytic infiltrates, TSH-induced hyperplasia of follicular tissue, or a thyroid tumor.

A subnormal serum TSH, indicating overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism, increases the possibility that a thyroid nodule is hyperfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely are cancer, a nodule that is hyperfunctioning on radioiodine imaging does not require FNA. In addition, thyroid scintigraphy may be useful in patients with multiple thyroid nodules to select those that are hypofunctional and therefore may require FNA. Although thyroid scintigraphy can be used to select nodules for FNA, it cannot be used to select patients for surgical resection.</p><p>Radionuclide scanning is contraindicated during pregnancy. If a women is breastfeeding, breastfeeding should be held if a radionuclide scan is obtained. The amount of time will depend on which isotope is used (breastfeeding needs to be held longer if radioiodine is used). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy#H590601\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Thyroid nodules'</a>.)</p><p>Scintigraphy utilizes one of the radioisotopes of iodine (usually 123-I) or technetium-99m pertechnetate. If available, radioiodine scanning is preferred. These radioisotopes are handled differently by thyroid follicular cells. Normal thyroid follicular cells take up both technetium and radioiodine, but only radioiodine is organified and stored (as thyroglobulin) in the lumen of thyroid follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Most benign and virtually all malignant thyroid nodules concentrate both radioisotopes less avidly than adjacent normal thyroid tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68835\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68835 \">image 1</a>). However, 5 percent of thyroid cancers concentrate pertechnetate but not radioiodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These nodules may appear hot or indeterminate (&quot;warm&quot;) on pertechnetate scans and cold on radioiodine scans. Although most are benign nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>], a few are thyroid cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25</a>]. As a result, patients with nodules that are functioning on pertechnetate imaging should undergo radioiodine imaging to confirm that they are actually functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>]. However, if the pertechnetate scan shows unequivocal increased uptake in a nodule with suppression of uptake elsewhere in the thyroid and an undetectable TSH, a radioiodine scan may not be necessary.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonfunctioning</strong> &ndash; Nonfunctioning nodules appear cold (uptake less than surrounding thyroid tissue) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68835\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68835 \">image 1</a>), and they may require further evaluation by FNA. (See <a href=\"#H1586261\" class=\"local\">'Sonographic criteria for FNA'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autonomous</strong> &ndash; Autonomous nodules may appear hot (uptake is greater than surrounding thyroid tissue) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79487\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79487 \">image 2</a>) if they are hyperfunctioning. Autonomous nodules that do not make sufficient thyroid hormone to suppress serum TSH concentrations will appear indeterminate on thyroid scintigraphy. Autonomous nodules account for only 5 to 10 percent of palpable nodules. Only a few patients with autonomous nodules have been found to have thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], and only a few of these cancers were aggressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Furthermore, in some of these patients, the cancer was adjacent to the autonomous nodule rather than within it. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely are cancer, a nodule that is hyperfunctioning on radioiodine imaging does not require FNA. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Autonomous nodules'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indeterminate</strong> &ndash; Because scintigraphy is two dimensional, its limitations result from the superimposition of abnormal nodular tissue and normally functioning thyroid tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72057\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72057 \">image 3</a>). Thus, while over 80 percent of nonautonomous nodules greater than 2 cm appear cold, smaller nodules present as a filling defect in less than one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The remaining majority of smaller nodules are indeterminate on thyroid scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. They could represent either small, nonfunctioning nodules anterior or posterior to normally functioning thyroid tissue, or autonomous nodules that do not produce sufficient thyroid hormone to suppress TSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51029\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51029 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These indeterminate nodules should <strong>not</strong> be referred to as warm or functioning, since the majority are, in fact, nonfunctioning nodules.

FNA biopsy is the most accurate method for evaluating thyroid nodules and selecting patients for thyroid surgery. Nodules that do not meet sonographic criteria for FNA should be monitored.
