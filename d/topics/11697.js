Depression occurs on a continuum ranging from subsyndromal symptoms to minor depression and major depression. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the different types of depression are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies of depression associated with interferon plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> vary in the type of depression that was assessed. Some studies have characterized depression as a single symptom (feeling down or sad) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], while other studies have defined depression as a syndrome characterized by a defined set of emotional and physical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].

Generally, depression is more common when viewed as a single symptom or as a score on a rating scale than when it is defined as the syndrome of major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of unipolar major depression in patients with hepatitis C who are treated with interferon plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> is high. A meta-analysis of 22 prospective observational studies examined the incidence of major depression in 1391 euthymic patients with chronic hepatitis C who started interferon plus ribavirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

As an example, one prospective 72-week study in 50 patients who received antiviral therapy found that major depression occurred in 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Interferon-ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C can cause a range of depressive symptoms, including suicidal ideation and behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Anxiety is a risk factor for suicide in depressed patients, highlighting the importance of screening for this symptom in patients who are also despondent or hopeless during treatment. Suicidal ideation and behavior, including the epidemiology, other risk factors, patient evaluation, and management are discussed separately.

Depression can also interfere with functioning, and may also be associated with a reduced viral response to therapy, independent of dose reductions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FATIGUE AND OTHER PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is the most common symptom during interferon-ribavirin therapy and has been associated with decreased adherence to treatment and reduced viral response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Most patients who meet criteria for major depression complain of fatigue and other physical symptoms such as sleep and appetite changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and fatigue often precedes other symptoms of major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63602 \">figure 1</a>). Many patients receiving interferon plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> develop these somatic (or neurovegetative) depressive symptoms without necessarily suffering from emotional complaints such as sadness, hopelessness, guilt, or loss of pleasure in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Fatigue generally begins within the first week or two of treatment, is maximal between weeks 4 and 12, and appears to decline afterward, although it does not typically resolve entirely until completion of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although patients on interferon-ribavirin therapy can have fatigue without meeting full criteria for major depression, the initial development of fatigue and other physical complaints (eg, insomnia, loss of appetite, and pain) is strongly associated with full depressive syndromes later in treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This observation is consistent with studies in the general population, showing that the single symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, or pain strongly predict the later development of full major depression. </p><p>As a result, patients treated with interferon-ribavirin therapy who present with fatigue, sleep disturbance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> appetite disturbance should be evaluated for the major depression. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> above.)</p><p>Treatment of fatigue, sleep disturbance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> appetite disturbance during interferon-ribavirin therapy, even when presenting in isolation, is reasonable for preventing or delaying onset of major depression.

Irritability can also be a symptom of hypomania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107 \">table 3</a>) or mania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]; however, mania secondary to interferon in patients with no prior history of bipolar disorder is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Mild to moderate irritability caused by interferon-ribavirin therapy is typically a depression-related symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. When severe, irritability may be a hypomanic or manic phenomenon.

Often, this requires collaboration with a mental health professional who is overseeing a given patient's psychopharmacological regimen. </p><p>Multiple studies have found that the degree of depression during interferon-ribavirin treatment is correlated with how depressed and anxious the patients were prior to beginning therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/9,11,14,30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,14,30-35</a>]. Many patients with mild or subsyndromal depressive symptoms prior to therapy will meet criteria for moderate to severe major depression during treatment. Furthermore, pretreatment depressive symptoms, anxiety, and irritability all predict poor treatment compliance with interferon-ribavirin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>As a result, we suggest assessing patients for depression and anxiety before beginning interferon-ribavirin therapy. Patients may not disclose depressive symptoms, and it may be useful to administer a self-report questionnaire such as the Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine Item (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 6</a>), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, Beck Depression Inventory, or the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Patients who score in mild or greater range on one of these scales are candidates for an antidepressant before starting antiviral therapy. Screening for depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults#H22016485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;, section on 'Screening instruments'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a past history of major depression are probably at increased risk for depression during interferon-ribavirin treatment. However, at least one study suggested that the increased risk was accounted for by the observation that patients with past depression were more likely than others to have elevated depressive symptom scores just prior to beginning antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, it appears that <span class=\"nowrap\">mood/anxiety</span> state just prior to treatment is the key risk factor and that past episodes of major depression exert their effect as a result of incomplete recovery and ongoing subsyndromal symptoms. </p><p>Women treated with interferon-ribavirin therapy are at increased risk of suffering major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], which is consistent with the elevated prevalence of depression among women in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Other potential risk factors for depression during antiviral treatment include a family history of mood disorder as well as neuropsychiatric side effects during previous treatment with interferon-ribavirin therapy. </p><p>A past history of substance abuse in patients who are currently abstinent does not appear to increase the risk for neuropsychiatric side effects during interferon-ribavirin treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuropsychiatric-side-effects-associated-with-interferon-plus-ribavirin-for-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-recognition-and-risk-factors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, whether treatment increases the risk for relapse of substance abuse is unclear.</p><p>It is not known whether patients with past manic episodes (ie, patients with bipolar disorder) are at increased risk for mania induced by interferon-ribavirin therapy, treatment-induced depression, or both.
