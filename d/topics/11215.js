However, the chronic administration of antiretroviral medications has led to the recognition of long-term complications of these therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Mitochondrial toxicity is recognized as a major adverse effect of nucleoside analogue treatment and can lead to myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatic steatosis with lactic acidosis, which can be life-threatening.</p><p>The induction of mitochondrial dysfunction by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) will be discussed here. The use of NRTIs for the treatment of HIV infection is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF MITOCHONDRIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main function of mitochondria is oxidative phosphorylation in which fatty acids and pyruvate are used as substrates to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Normally there is tight coupling between oxidation and phosphorylation (OXPHOS) that is governed by normal mitochondrial enzymes, such as the cytochrome oxidases and other enzymes of the respiratory chain system. OXPHOS is also responsible for neutralization of free radicals and beta-oxidation of free fatty acids.</p><p>Mitochondria also play an important role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced physiologically during oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative stress can occur if there is an imbalance between the production of ROS and cellular antioxidant defenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Mitochondrial DNA polymerase is a target of oxidative damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nucleoside analogues are effective in inhibiting HIV replication due to their high affinity for the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase (a viral DNA polymerase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. However, NRTIs can also bind to other human DNA-polymerases, like DNA polymerase beta (necessary for repair of nuclear DNA) and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, which is exclusively responsible for the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By inhibiting mtDNA enzyme polymerase-gamma, NRTIs can lead to depletion of mtDNA, resulting in organelle dysfunction and impairment of oxidative phosphorylation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62034 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. mtDNA encodes 13 mitochondrial polypeptides involved in the respiratory chain that are essential for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A disruption of OXPHOS leads to energy loss (decreased ATP) and an increase in electron leakage from the electron-transport chain, which increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. ROS, in turn, damage proteins, lipids, and mtDNA, leading to a cascade of further oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation. mtDNA is vulnerable to mutations since it has no introns or histones. </p><p>Although the so-called &quot;pol-gamma hypothesis&quot; still remains the most important explanation for the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction by NRTIs, nucleoside analogues can also influence intracellular nucleoside transporters, disturb the delicate balance of the intracellular nucleoside pools, or alter kinetics of phosphorylation of natural nucleosides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Furthermore, the acceleration of mtDNA turnover as a compensatory mechanism for mtDNA depletion can lead to persistent accumulation of somatic mutations in mtDNA even after NRTI withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The impact of all these effects on long-term mitochondrial function is still unclear. </p><p>Expression of mitochondrial toxicity may not occur until a specific biologic threshold of mitochondrial dysfunction has been reached. Onset of mitochondrial toxicity may vary depending on the individual cell type since copy numbers of mtDNA vary, as well as cellular dependence on energy production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Mitochondria are found in all cells of the body except for erythrocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Production of lactate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early effects of mitochondrial toxicity include decreased energy production and increased production of lactate. During glycolysis, glucose is metabolized to pyruvate and energy is produced in the form of ATP. Under normal conditions, pyruvate is taken up by mitochondria and metabolized to acetyl-CoA, which feeds into the Krebs cycle. This pathway is responsible for most of the cell's energy production. In the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction, the metabolism of pyruvate is shifted to lactate, with a decrease in energy production.</p><p>A decrease in OXPHOS will impair ATP production, beta oxidation of fatty acids, and neutralization of free radicals leading to oxidative stress. Furthermore, since acetyl-co-A can no longer enter the Krebs cycle, it will alternatively be metabolized into ketone bodies, while lactate and triglycerides will accumulate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76153 \">figure 2</a>). Since every cell type has a different dependence on OXPHOS, cellular dysfunction will only emerge after the decrease in OXPHOS has dropped below a certain cell-dependent threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLICATED DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eight nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are available for treatment of HIV. The most commonly used ones are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> (3TC), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a> (FTC), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> (ABC), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> (TDF), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (TAF). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Zidovudine</a> (ZDV), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> (ddI), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> (d4T) are less frequently used, and zalcitabine (ddC) was removed from the market in 2006. A discussion on selecting an antiretroviral regimen is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-an-antiretroviral-regimen-for-treatment-experienced-hiv-infected-patients-who-are-failing-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients who are failing therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>All NRTIs are chain terminators and result in the reversible termination of the viral DNA chain and also (if incorporated) of the mtDNA chain. This point is important since discontinuation of medications may lead to reversibility of mitochondrial toxicity if recognized early.</p><p>The NRTIs all have different affinities for mtDNA polymerase gamma, explaining in part the different propensity of the drugs to induce toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above). In vitro, the order of strength of inhibiting polymerase gamma for the different NRTIs is: ddC &gt;&gt; ddI &gt; d4T &ge; ZDV &gt;&gt;&gt; TDF = 3TC = FTC = ABC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. There are insufficient data to speculate about TAF. Other factors that may explain the varying effects of individual drugs on DNA polymerase gamma include differences in cell entry, and transport to the mitochondrial membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Some NRTIs (ddC, ddI, and d4T) are particularly associated with a decline in mtDNA content and ultrastructural changes, including swollen or enlarged mitochondria and loss and distortion of their cristae. Due to the significant risk of mitochondrial toxicity associated with DDI and D4T, these drugs are generally avoided for the treatment of HIV, and distribution by the original producer will be stopped in September 2017. It is unclear how long generic d4T and ddI will be available thereafter.</p><p>Mitochondrial toxicity secondary to drug exposure had been described prior to the development of antiretroviral medications. These drugs included valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, and others. Fialuridine (FIAU) was a nucleoside analogue in clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis B, but the clinical trial was prematurely halted when patients developed evidence of liver failure and hepatic steatosis that was secondary to mitochondrial toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. FIAU was efficiently incorporated into internal positions of mtDNA in place of thymidine and led to ultrastructural changes in mitochondria and increased intracellular lipid droplets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Histological findings of liver tissue demonstrated severe accumulation of microvesicular and macrovesicular fat, with minimal necrosis of hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Electron microscopy showed abnormal mitochondria and the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes. There was no known repair mechanism to remove the internal FIAU and the damage to mtDNA was permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of mitochondrial toxicity depends on the target organ that is involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54147\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54147 \">table 1</a>). There is little doubt that mitochondrial toxicity is the major cause of NRTI-induced myopathy, neuropathy, lipoatrophy, and lactic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/6,7,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,25</a>]. Whether mitochondrial toxicity is involved in other clinical manifestations, such as pancreatitis, myelosuppression, cardiomyopathy, tubular dysfunction, or osteopenia, is not as clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first reports of a toxic mitochondrial myopathy in HIV-infected patients were related to the use of ZDV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Symptoms of myopathy included proximal muscle weakness, tenderness, and myalgia. The majority of patients have elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels and may occasionally have elevated lactate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Occasionally a patient may have electromyographic evidence of proximal muscle myopathy despite normal muscle enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>ZDV affects the muscle mitochondria by inhibiting DNA polymerase gamma, resulting in termination of the DNA chain and depletion of muscle mtDNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31</a>]. Histological features include an inflammatory, destructive mitochondrial myopathy with &quot;ragged-red&quot; fibers seen on trichrome stain, indicative of abnormal mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients with ubiquitous &quot;ragged-red&quot; fibers also have significant lipid and glycogen accumulation in proximity to abnormal mitochondria, as seen in patients with inherited mitochondrial myopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. When mitochondria are structurally and functionally abnormal, long-chain fatty acids cannot be effectively utilized, resulting in lipid accumulation within the muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Carnitine, which is essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the muscle mitochondria, is depleted in ZDV-treated patients who have significant numbers of &quot;ragged-red&quot; fibers on muscle biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Two patients who had repeat biopsies after discontinuation of ZDV showed marked histologic improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipoatrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical alterations in adipose tissue and metabolic changes, such as insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia, are observed in patients taking highly active antiretroviral therapy. This constellation of findings is referred to as the &quot;lipodystrophy syndrome&quot;. Lipoatrophy, or fat atrophy, is associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor use, particularly d4T [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p>Several groups have demonstrated profound mtDNA depletion and morphologic alterations in subcutaneous fat biopsies of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. Some have speculated that lipoatrophy is secondary to adipocyte apoptosis rather than necrosis, because the loss of fat is neither painful nor inflammatory. Furthermore, mitochondria are closely involved in apoptotic pathways, again implying a role for NRTI-induced toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/15,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,40</a>]. Others have suggested that HIV itself may cause mitochondrial dysfunction, either directly or indirectly through the induction of inflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment of lipoatrophy are discussed elsewhere.

In 1993, eight cases of severe hepatomegaly with diffuse steatosis were reported in HIV-infected patients without AIDS, six of which were fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. All had received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> for a minimum of six months prior to the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms and mild elevations of transaminases. Case reports of liver failure and hepatic steatosis have since been reported, especially in association with ddI and d4T [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Microvesicular hepatic steatosis has been identified in most of these cases, which is related to mitochondrial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Decreased mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids leads to increased esterification of triglycerides and a decreased egress of triglycerides from the liver, which accumulate as small lipid droplets. Prior to the era of potent ART, it was well recognized that other drugs that inhibit mitochondrial oxidation, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, ethanol, and salicylic acid, can lead to these histologic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis are associated with NRTI use and typically occur in the absence of systemic hypoperfusion (called type B lactic acidosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Hepatic dysfunction may be an essential prerequisite for the development of lactate accumulation, since the liver is the most important organ for clearance of lactate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Symptoms of hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis may be nonspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, and severe fatigue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73056\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73056 \">table 2</a>). Serum aminotransferases are only mildly abnormal in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Lactic acidosis usually follows a minimum of six months of treatment, but may occur precipitously. Due to the nonspecificity of symptoms, hyperlactatemia may not be recognized for weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Without intervention, lactic acidosis leads to a fatal outcome, most often due to liver failure and cardiac arrhythmias. NRTIs (and thus also other antiretroviral medication) should be stopped promptly and supportive medication should be initiated. </p><p>In the pre-ART era, lactic acidosis was described in patients on monotherapy with high-dose ZDV (1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and ddI with an estimated incidence of 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/1000</span> treated patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In the early era of combination therapy, d4T and ddI were most closely associated with this syndrome, sometimes in combination with each other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-toxicity-of-hiv-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors/abstract/30,48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,48-51</a>].</p><p>In a prospective study in South Africa, 1771 HIV-infected participants were randomly assigned to a nucleoside backbone of <span class=\"nowrap\">d4T/3TC</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">ddI/AZT</span> plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> or <span class=\"nowrap\">lopinavir/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a></span>.

Symptomatic hyperlactatemia was defined as serum lactate &gt;2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> with symptoms consistent with increased lactate (eg, nausea, anorexia, fatigue). A total of 13 cases with lactic acidosis (0.7 percent) and 28 cases with symptomatic hyperlactatemia (1.6 percent) were observed and two patients died.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitochondria play an important role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced physiologically during oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative stress can occur if there is an imbalance between the production of these reactive metabolites and cellular antioxidant defenses. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Role of mitochondria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NRTIs are effective in inhibiting HIV replication due to their high affinity for the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. However, NRTIs can also bind to human DNA-polymerases, like mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, which is exclusively responsible for the replication of mitochondrial DNA. By inhibiting this enzyme, NRTIs can cause depletion of mitochondrial DNA, resulting in organelle dysfunction and mitochondrial toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The various NRTIs have different affinities for mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma; those with the highest affinity (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a>) are associated with the highest risk of mitochondrial toxicity. Due to the significant risk of mitochondrial toxicity associated with didanosine and stavudine use, these drugs are no longer recommended for the treatment of HIV.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Implicated drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of mitochondrial toxicity depends on the target organ that is involved. Mitochondrial toxicity is the major cause of NRTI-induced myopathy, neuropathy, lipoatrophy, and lactic acidosis.
