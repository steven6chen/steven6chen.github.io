HSG is commonly performed as part of an infertility evaluation or after placement of contraceptive micro-inserts.</p><p>This topic will review the indications for HSG, preparation, technique, and test results. Other methods for assessing the uterine cavity and tubal patency are reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=saline-infusion-sonohysterography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Saline infusion sonohysterography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258566300\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSG is the evaluation of the uterine cavity, fallopian tubes, and adjacent peritoneal cavity following the injection of contrast material through the cervical canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is performed as a real-time outpatient examination under fluoroscopy with iodinated water-soluble radio-opaque material.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421687712\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4089630631\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As HSG assesses fallopian tube patency and intrauterine contour, clinical indications for HSG include evaluation of female infertility or suspected uterine anomalies, preprocedure planning for hysteroscopy, and postprocedure assessment following tubal ligation or tubal reversal procedures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infertility evaluation: HSG is mainly used in the evaluation of female infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. HSG can identify fallopian tube obstruction, dilation (hydrosalpinx), and surrounding adhesions as well as uterine synechiae, intracavitary lesions, and septa. (See <a href=\"#H3161408755\" class=\"local\">'Tubes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H778377216\" class=\"local\">'Uterus'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected congenital uterine anomalies: Congenital uterine anomalies (eg, septate, bicornuate, or unicornuate uteri) can be detected with HSG. However, additional imaging, such as three-dimensional ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, is typically required to provide information about the external contours of the uterus before the definitive diagnosis can be made. (See <a href=\"#H363325763\" class=\"local\">'Other abnormalities'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preprocedure planning: Some hysteroscopic procedures, including myomectomy, adhesion resection, and septum resection, benefit from preprocedure HSG to identify the location and size of lesions for resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. While hysteroscopy and three-dimensional sonohysterography are performed to assess the uterine cavity only, HSG can be helpful if tubal information is needed simultaneously or if the other modalities are not available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-myomectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic myomectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-adhesions-clinical-manifestation-and-diagnosis#H29099245\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine adhesions: Clinical manifestation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of congenital uterine anomalies&quot;, section on 'Hysteroscopic repair of the septate uterus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postprocedure assessment: HSG is performed to confirm tubal occlusion after tubal micro-insert placement (commercial name Essure) and to confirm tubal patency after tubal reanastomosis procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

Active menstruation is a relative contraindication. In our practice, we use an algorithm to exclude women with contraindications prior to performing the HSG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107393\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107393 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456996244\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280699690\"><span class=\"h2\">History and consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to examination, a brief medical history is obtained from the patient to ensure there are no contraindications to the study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107393\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107393 \">algorithm 1</a>). Examination indication, the duration of any gynecologic symptoms, history of previous pelvic infections or surgery, obstetric history, contraceptive use, date of the last menstrual period, and prior contrast reactions are discussed.</p><p>The operating clinician explains the procedural steps and answers the patient's questions prior to obtaining written consent. Informed consent includes the possibility of pelvic discomfort, vaginal bleeding, infection, contrast reaction, and irradiation of an unsuspected pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107400\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107400 \">table 2</a>). Women with indwelling fallopian tube micro-inserts or intrauterine devices are advised about the small risk of implant dislodgement that could require a separate procedure for replacement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=informed-procedural-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Informed procedural consent&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3511394865\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform HSG on days 6 through 11 from the last menstrual period (LMP) to avoid both pregnancy and menstrual bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107393\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107393 \">algorithm 1</a>). Neither serum nor urine pregnancy tests reliably excludes pregnancy during the first three weeks following the LMP and therefore are not routinely required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As many women presenting for HSG are undergoing fertility evaluation and tracking their periods, reported LMPs are typically accurate and adequate. If the patient cannot recall the date of LMP, we ask her to chart her menstrual cycle and reschedule the test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy#H104487144\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Types of pregnancy tests'</a>.)</p><p>Alternatively, if the patient is measuring urine luteinizing hormone (LH) levels to determine ovulation, the HSG can be performed if there is no evidence of ovulation by the LH test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3876334649\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPROCEDURE CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1908572176\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported rates of pelvic infection following HSG in five series ranged between 0.3 and 3.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely prescribed before the procedure. However, antibiotic therapy is started at the time of examination in women with dilated tubes or peritubal adhesions because these findings have been associated with increased risk of postprocedure infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/5,9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,12,13</a>]. The most common regimen for prophylaxis is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 100 mg by mouth twice a day for five days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Patient movement as a result of pain can increase the risk of uterine perforation or suboptimal images, which can increase the radiation exposure. Pain can be minimized by slowly injecting the contrast medium and using isosmolar contrast agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With counseling, most women tolerate the uterine cramps and thus analgesia is not routinely administered. We inform women that the pain is typically mild and self-limited. We advise women to use over-the-counter analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if bothersome uterine cramping occurs on the days following the examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-therapeutic-use-and-variability-of-response-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults&quot;, section on 'Dosing and duration'</a>.)</p><p>A meta-analysis of trials evaluating pain relief during hysterosalpingography reported reduced visual analogue scale pain scores with administration of intravenous opioid (mean difference -3.5, 95% CI -4.3 to -2.8, one trial, 62 women) or preprocedure topical anesthesia (mean difference -0.6, 95% CI -1.1 to -0.2, seven trials, 613 women) compared with no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, definitive conclusions were limited by small number of participants and lack of reporting on adverse events in the opioid trial and by study design and limited treatment effect in the topical anesthesia trials.</p><p>Severe postprocedure pain is not typical after an HSG; women with severe pain are evaluated for possible complication. (See <a href=\"#H1105857389\" class=\"local\">'Postprocedure follow-up and complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2736574899\"><span class=\"h2\">Contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During an HSG, iodinated contrast is injected retrograde into the uterine cavity, through the fallopian tubes, and into the peritoneal cavity. While the amount varies with uterine size and peritoneal spillage, 10 to 30 mL is a typical dose. Some of this material is cleared intravascularly, and hence the patient is exposed indirectly to small quantities of systemic contrast. Nonionic, water-soluble contrast is used because the rates of allergic reaction are much lower compared with ionic contrast media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>In women with a history of a moderate contrast reaction, the examination is relatively contraindicated and is performed (with premedication) only if alternative methods for assessing tubal patency (ie, laparoscopy with chromopertubation) are unavailable or are considered less safe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107386\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107386 \">table 1</a>). Patients with a history of a mild reaction can undergo HSG safely after receiving prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107394 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For women with a history of any contrast allergy, HSG is performed in settings with the expertise and resources to manage a contrast reaction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we prefer water-soluble contrast rather than oil-based contrast for diagnostic HSGs. Water-soluble contrast provides higher quality images and does not require precautionary measures to avoid the small risk of pulmonary and cerebral embolism that can occur with intravascular injection of oil-based contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, oil-based contrast may be preferred in infertile women with low risk of tubal disease because use of oil-based contrast appears to improve live birth rates for the subgroup of women who receive oil-based contrast and then proceed with fertility therapy. A multicenter trial that randomly assigned over 1100 women with infertility, but low risk for tubal disease (as indicated by no history of pelvic inflammatory disease, previous chlamydia infection, or known endometriosis), to HSG with either oil-based or water-soluble contrast reported a 37 percent higher rate of ongoing pregnancy and a 38 percent higher rate of live birth in the oil-based contrast group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the majority of the difference in ongoing pregnancy rates was attributable to women who then underwent infertility treatment; there were no differences in the ongoing pregnancy rates between the two groups when only the women who conceived spontaneously were evaluated (73.6 percent for oil compared with 72.7 for water). Rates of adverse events were low and equivalent between both contrast types. In contrast, one prior smaller randomized trial and a meta-analysis of this trial plus one other that included infertile women at high risk for tubal disease did not report higher live birth rates with oil-based contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. As noted above, we will continue to use water-soluble contrast because our patient population is more similar to the ones in the smaller trials and because the rates of spontaneous conception in the larger trial comparing oil-based and water-soluble contrast were the same. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933863358\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSG involves ionizing radiation using real-time fluoroscopy during which selected spot radiographs are acquired. Average dose to the female gonads is 2.7 mGy and an effective dose is 1.2 mSv, as measured in a series of 78 consecutive patients undergoing infertility workup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The mean fluoroscopic time is 0.3 minutes and mean number of radiographs is 3.2. To put these numbers into context, the effective dose from annual background radiation is 3.1 mSv and from screening mammography is 0.4 mSv [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In terms of biological effects of the radiation conferred by HSG, the risk for anomalies in a future embryo and for fatal cancer induction in an exposed woman ages 20 to 29 years are estimated at 2.7 x 10<sup>-5</sup> and 14.5 x 10<sup>-5</sup>, respectively. These risks are over one thousandfold lower than the background rates of birth defects and of spontaneous cancers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1580095617\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1976480672\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We begin the procedure by placing the patient in dorsal lithotomy position and performing a bimanual vaginal examination to assess uterine body flexion, cervical location relative to the vaginal introitus, and size of the vaginal canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Next, the clinician places a speculum into the vagina, visualizes the cervix, and swabs the cervix with antiseptic soap (or saline in the case of allergy). A blunt dilator is placed in the cervical canal for a few moments to facilitate dilation. We use a long forceps to pass a 5-F flexible balloon-tipped catheter through the endocervix into the uterine cavity. The catheter is fixed in place by inflating the balloon with 1.0 to 1.5 cc of sterile water. Alternately, some clinicians use a Jarcho cannula and tenaculum. Before catheter or cannula insertion, contrast is passed through the instrument to expel as many air bubbles as possible. Women with a steeply antero- or retro-flexed uterus can require straightening of the cervico-uterine angle to allow passage of the catheter. For these women, we place a tenaculum on the anterior cervical lip and then apply gentle downward traction while passing the catheter into the uterine cavity. Once in the uterine body, the catheter is retracted gently to ensure that the balloon creates a tight seal over the internal cervical os. The speculum is then removed so as not to obscure visualization of the cervical canal and lower uterine segment and the patient is repositioned supine under the fluoroscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000014655\"><span class=\"h2\">Image acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attention to correct fluoroscopic technique is necessary to optimize image quality and reduce radiation dose. To decrease background scatter, the distance from the beam source to the target organs is minimized and images are coned.

The early filling anteroposterior view of the uterus is taken after injection of a few mL of contrast because lesions such as polyps, submucous myomas, or synechiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67493%7EOBGYN%2F80816%7EOBGYN%2F60263\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67493 graphicRef80816 graphicRef60263 \">image 2A-C</a>) could be concealed when the uterus is distended with contrast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55045\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55045 \">image 3</a>). Further incremental injections outline the cornua, isthmic, and ampullary portions of the tubes, which normally demonstrate rugal folds. The contrast then spills from the ends of patent tubes. Peritubal adhesions are suggested by the collection of contrast around the distal end of a tube that persists on delayed imaging following catheter removal. If significant pain occurs during the procedure, the injection is stopped for a few moments followed by slower injection of contrast.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2563514505\"><span class=\"h2\">Images of fallopian tube micro-inserts (Essure)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSG is performed three months after contraceptive micro-insert (commercial name Essure) placement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73083\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73083 \">figure 1</a>) to confirm insert location and bilateral tubal occlusion, both of which are required for contraceptive efficacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107416\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef107416 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. If the woman is using an alternate form of contraception, the HSG can be performed at any time during her cycle except peak menses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-sterilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic sterilization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are four radiographic markers on the device; two markers are located at each of the proximal and distal ends (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107411\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107411 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>]. The distance between the proximal markers can vary based on the amount of flexion in the outer coil; the distal markers are fixed in relation to each other. Confirmation of satisfactory insert location requires visualizing the micro-tip (ie, distal end of inner coil) and coil within the fallopian tube, with less than 50 percent of the outer coil trailing into the uterine cavity, or visualizing the micro-tip and coil up to 30 mm into the tube from the uterine cornua (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107411\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107411 \">figure 2</a>). Satisfactory occlusion is defined as occlusion at the cornua or when contrast is visible within the tube but not past any portion of distal end of the coil.</p><p>Contrast is instilled into the uterine cavity until cornual distention is seen.

Some common difficulties and potential solutions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaking of contrast media: Use of a balloon catheter reduces the risk of contrast leak. If the study is being done with a cannula, using a larger cannula tip or placing additional traction on the tenaculum can resolve the leak.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical stenosis: Women with cervical stenosis can require a pediatric bladder catheter or cervical dilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dilation and curettage&quot;, section on 'Cervical dilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air bubbles: Air bubbles can mimic filling defects in the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70355\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70355 \">image 5</a>) or tubes. Prior to the examination, we expel as many bubbles as possible through the catheter. During fluoroscopy, rotation of the woman can cause air bubble movement, which helps to distinguish mobile bubbles from fixed structural abnormalities.

For comparison, the effective dose from annual background radiation is 3.1 mSv and from screening mammography is 0.4 mSv. (See <a href=\"#H933863358\" class=\"local\">'Radiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correct fluoroscopic technique optimizes image quality and reduces radiation dose. To decrease background scatter, the distance from the beam source to the target organs is minimized and images are coned. Contrast is injected slowly to minimize pain and potential cornual spasm. (See <a href=\"#H1000014655\" class=\"local\">'Image acquisition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubal processes visualized with HSG includes obstruction, hydrosalpinx, and contraceptive micro-insert placement and resultant obstruction. Cornual spasm can mimic tubal occlusion by preventing contrast from filling an otherwise patent tube. Less commonly, the HSG will identify peritoneal adhesions, salpingitis isthmica nodosa, or genital tract tuberculosis. (See <a href=\"#H3161408755\" class=\"local\">'Tubes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine pathology visible by HSG includes uterine filling defects and endometrial contour abnormalities. Filling defects can be caused by leiomyomas, endometrial polyps, and synechiae. Contour abnormalities can represent adenomyosis, congenital M&uuml;llerian anomalies, and in-utero diethylstilbestrol exposure. (See <a href=\"#H778377216\" class=\"local\">'Uterus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSG test performance is affected by factors such as underlying pathology, the training and experience of the clinician(s) performing the procedure and interpreting the images, and the standard used to validate the HSG results. HSG is most useful for predicting tubal occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H3661870503\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic performance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After HSG, mild cramps, leaking of contrast, and a small amount of bleeding from the vagina are common for a day or two. Usual activities can be resumed immediately. Heavy bleeding, fever, or severe pain are not normal and require evaluation for possible complication. (See <a href=\"#H1105857389\" class=\"local\">'Postprocedure follow-up and complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2905708432\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Theodore A Baramki, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysterosalpingography/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Chalazonitis A, Tzovara I, Laspas F, et al.
