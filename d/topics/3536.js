Concerns over the dangers of cigarette smoking for the fetus serve as an additional motivator to stop smoking. Additionally, pregnancy also provides an opportunity to educate the woman's partner or family members on the benefits of smoking cessation for themselves, the woman, and the baby. </p><p>This topic will review strategies and treatment options for women who desire to stop smoking while pregnant. Related information on the impact of cigarette smoking on maternal and fetal outcomes is reviewed separately.

Most women who are able to quit smoking by themselves during pregnancy do so prior to their first prenatal visit. In the absence of intervention, women still smoking after their first prenatal visit are likely to continue smoking during pregnancy. Risk factors for continued smoking include lower education status (less than high school level), heavy smoking (&gt;10 cigarettes per day), a partner or other household member who smokes, public insurance, poor coping skills, multiparity, and coexisting emotional or psychiatric problems (eg, depression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/5-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-14</a>].

Examples of brief interventions include information about smoking-related risks from the physician and frequent follow-up to assess patient progress, as well as use of a pregnancy-specific or other self-help manual, one or more sessions with a health educator, and video tapes on smoking risks and cessation. Despite evidence that brief interventions work to reduce maternal smoking, it is estimated that only 49 percent of obstetricians routinely advise and provide follow-up for smoking cessation; furthermore, only 28 percent discuss actual strategies for cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

We discuss the risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy with either nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> and ask about any contraindications. While both NRT and bupropion are reasonable drug options, the optimal treatment is not known, and the patient&rsquo;s preferences help determine the medication choice. (See <a href=\"#H2342569028\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For all women, we also ask about additional comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, or substance abuse, that may be contributing to continued smoking. We advise guided meditation (free via smartphone apps or online) and counseling with a mental health provider for all women who report anxiety. We refer patients as needed for treatment of depression or substance abuse. We involve the partner in the discussion as much as possible and, if the partner smokes, we discuss how smoking cessation can benefit him, his partner, and his family. If he is interested in quitting, we refer him to his primary care physician for smoking cessation treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2923815506\"><span class=\"h2\">General questions (5 A's) to smoking cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The five A's (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange) provide a general approach to helping patients stop smoking, as detailed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50450 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/17,18,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,25-27</a>].

For nonpregnant women, we counsel about the benefits of quitting, including the benefits that are specific to pregnancy. We encourage women to quit smoking before planning a pregnancy and refer those who are interested in quitting to smoking cessation programs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Remember that some women find it difficult to admit to smoking initially or upon relapse. In one study of 107 self-reported pregnant quitters, 26 percent had salivary cotinine levels consistent with current smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Advise women that quitting at any point during pregnancy is beneficial, although quitting as soon as possible is the best. We discuss the benefits of smoking cessation for the pregnancy as well as for lifelong maternal and family health. We also discuss the known risks of continued smoking on pregnancy complications and risks to her child.

Reasons given for continuing to smoke in pregnancy were skepticism about smoking-related harms, addiction to nicotine, and the smoking behavior of partners <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family members. Most women considered use of nicotine patches acceptable; however, some expressed doubt of patch safety, believing continued smoking was preferable. The women noted that care providers differed in their approaches to smoking cessation and that some no longer asked about smoking status after they reported &quot;cutting down.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36699589\"><span class=\"h2\">Abstinence versus reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although abstinence early in pregnancy will produce the greatest benefits to the fetus and mother, quitting at any point in pregnancy can yield benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Moreover, it is likely that nondisclosure underestimates the effects of &quot;cutting down.&quot; A placebo-controlled randomized trial of nicotine gum for smoking cessation during pregnancy reported similar quit rates in both the active drug and placebo groups; however, women in the nicotine gum group smoked fewer cigarettes and had lower cotinine levels and higher birth weights than those in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

A meta-analysis of 30 studies (randomized trials, cluster-randomized trials, and quasi-randomized trials) reported counseling increased smoking cessation in late pregnancy compared with usual care (average risk ratio [RR] 1.44, 95% CI 1.19-1.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

A borderline effect was reported for the time frame 6 to 11 months (average RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00-1.77, six studies).

Given the known harms of continued smoking during pregnancy and the benefits of smoking cessation, we offer pharmacotherapy in addition to cessation counseling to pregnant women who are otherwise unable to quit or who are at high risk for continued smoking. These women include those who are heavy smokers (&gt;10 cigarettes per day), those smoking later in pregnancy, and those who have been unsuccessful in a previous attempt to stop. We believe the benefits of quitting with pharmacotherapy outweigh the potential risks of pharmacotherapy and the risks of continued smoking. </p><p>When pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is utilized, general principles of prescribing drugs during pregnancy should be followed. These include using the lowest dose necessary to achieve success in order to minimize fetal exposure and, if possible, delaying therapy until the second trimester in order to avoid the period of embryogenesis when the fetus is most sensitive to teratogens. Despite concerns about underdosing due to the changes in pharmacokinetics due to pregnancy, we start with the lowest medication dose and titrate accordingly. </p><p>While both nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> are reasonable drug options, the safety and efficacy of these drugs have not been directly compared in randomized trials including pregnant women; thus, the optimal treatment is not known. Given the limited available data, it is reasonable to offer both NRT and bupropion as adjuncts to cessation counseling and ask the patient to participate in the selection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97259 \">table 2</a>). As data on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> use in pregnancy are lacking, we avoid varenicline in pregnant women.

Examples of the conflicting body of evidence include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2015 meta-analysis of eight trials reported that, compared with placebo and nonplacebo controls, NRT as an adjunct to behavioral therapy was favored for smoking cessation in pregnancy (risk ratio [RR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.03-1.93, n = 2199 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, the subgroup analysis that compared NRT with placebo treatments demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward a benefit (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99-1.66, n = 1926 women). In this meta-analysis, there were no differences between NRT-treated and control women in rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, birth weight, low birth weight, admissions to neonatal intensive care unit, cesarean delivery, congenital abnormalities, or neonatal death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent questionnaire study of over 1200 pregnant women who smoked, women who used the nicotine patch to aid smoking cessation reported higher rates of smoking cessation compared with no NRT use (79 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. After discontinuing NRT, 68 percent of prior patch users did not smoke again during and up to one year after pregnancy. In adjusted analysis, NRT was also associated with a nearly 40 percent reduced risk for small for gestational age infants and 80 percent lower risk of prematurity compared with continued smoking. Pregnancies ending in stillbirth were excluded from the study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A different trial of 1050 women reported that only 7 percent of patients in the nicotine patch intervention group adhered to nicotine replacement for more than one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. One potential explanation for poor compliance and limited reduction in smoking is that nicotine is metabolized more rapidly in pregnancy; therefore, women in clinical trials may have been underdosed. In addition, women are afraid to take nicotine replacement during pregnancy despite the fact that they are continuing to smoke. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small trial that evaluated the use of nicotine gum did not find a significant difference in biochemically validated smoking cessation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, use of nicotine gum was associated with increased birth weight and gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2670359688\"><span class=\"h3\">Risks and benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no strong evidence that pregnant smokers who use NRT are at higher risk of adverse perinatal events, including teratogenesis, than pregnant smokers not using this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/46,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,54</a>]. In a trial of 1050 pregnant smokers randomly assigned to NRT or placebo, children exposed to nicotine replacement in utero had as good or better development outcomes at two-year follow-up compared with unexposed children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Additionally, in a retrospective study of nearly 200,000 children born in the United Kingdom, the rates of major congenital anomalies were not statistically different among children born to women using NRT, women who were actively smoking and not using nicotine therapy, and women who did not use either [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. There was a higher risk of congenital respiratory anomalies in the children exposed to NRT compared with those with no nicotine exposure (odds ratio 4.65, 99% CI 1.76-12.25), but the absolute risk difference was very small. Major limitations of this study include the low rate of NRT (1.3 percent of total group) and higher rates of maternal morbidities in the nicotine replacement and smoking groups.</p><p>While the fetal impact of NRT may not be fully known, NRT does not appear to be harmful and may be associated with lower rates of prematurity and small for gestational age infants. Even if NRT cannot entirely reduce all of the risks associated with smoking during pregnancy, maternal smoking cessation results in less in-utero exposure of the fetus to non-nicotine cigarette toxins such as carbon monoxide that may also contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, assessment of the impact of NRT during pregnancy does not typically evaluate postnatal outcomes that are influenced by continued or resumed smoking, such as upper respiratory infections, asthma, hospital admission, otitis media, and sudden infant death syndrome. Therefore, the full effect of NRT may be underestimated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2069685427\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who elect a trial of NRT, administration is similar to that of nonpregnant adults. We generally begin with an intermediate dose patch and short-acting agents (eg, gum or lozenge) as needed for breakthrough symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97259 \">table 2</a>).

However, at least one health organization states data on benefits and risks of ENDS are insufficient to recommend using these devices in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, a study that evaluated the impact of the heating coil on the inhaled aerosol reported that ENDS vapor potentially contains toxic metals (chromium, nickel, and lead) as well as metals that are toxic when inhaled (manganese and zinc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, although supporting data are lacking, many pregnant women believe ENDS are safer in pregnancy. In one survey study of 326 pregnant women, nearly 75 percent of the ENDS ever-users believed these products to be less harmful compared with traditional cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. More data are needed on the physiologic impact of ENDS on the mother and fetus and the role of these devices in smoking cessation.

Based on available information on the physiological effects of these drugs on mother and fetus, there should be no additional risk from continuing their use intrapartum in women who used them antepartum. In addition, they may be useful to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms in heavy smokers who are uncomfortable when hospitalization forces them to abstain from smoking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2109230348\"><span class=\"h2\">Bupropion</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2527594820\"><span class=\"h3\">Use and efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> (commercial name Zyban) as an adjunct to counseling.

However, the data on fetal impact are limited, inconsistent, and might be confounded by additional factors such as maternal depression or concurrent use of other antidepressants. While a clear association with congenital malformations has not been established, we discuss the option of initiating medication after the first trimester ultrasound is performed (generally 11 to 14 weeks) so that we can evaluate the early fetal anatomy before starting treatment. After discussion of these data, some women may choose to wait until the second trimester before beginning bupropion. Other women prefer to delay initiating therapy until the detailed anatomical ultrasound assessment is performed (generally 18 to 20 weeks). It is important for the expectant mother to be comfortable with the treatment timing as well as choice, which may also improve compliance.

It is unclear whether bupropion increases the risk of malformations. The bupropion pregnancy registry report, published by the manufacturer, prospectively reviewed nearly 1600 pregnancies from 1997 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The committee concluded that the observed 3.6 percent incidence of birth defects after first trimester exposure (n = 806) was consistent with the general population rate. They also noted repeated occurrence of heart defects, but concluded that the data were insufficient to evaluate if bupropion increased heart defect risk. A subsequent retrospective case-control study from the United States National Birth Defects Prevention Study reported an increased risk for left ventricular outflow tract heart defects (hypoplastic left heart, aortic stenosis, and aortic coarctation) with first trimester exposure to bupropion (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.7) but the wide confidence interval made the true magnitude of risk less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Some of the women had also taken other antidepressants, which further complicated the analysis.

In women who are not already using medication to aid their smoking cessation efforts, we offer breastfeeding women nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in conjunction with counseling. Of note, the 2013 Committee on Drugs of the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that NRT was the preferred pharmacologic approach to smoking cessation in breastfeeding women, although the rationale for the statement is unclear as both NRT and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> are excreted into breastmilk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupropion</a> &ndash; Although no adverse effects in breastfeeding infants have been reported, available data are very limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

In a systematic review of 36 studies evaluating effectiveness of smoking relapse prevention interventions in nonpregnant abstinent former smokers, use of self-help materials or pharmacotherapy was modestly effective in preventing relapse at 12 to 18 months' follow-up (self-help materials odds ratio [OR] 1.5, nicotine replacement OR 1.3, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> OR 1.5); behavioral interventions were less effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of 31 studies reported the most common predictors of postpartum smoking relapse included being less well educated, younger, or multiparous, or living with a partner or household member who smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The postpartum period is a period of great stress and emotional fluctuations, and lack of both social supports and coping skills has been implicated in relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/76,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,83,84</a>].

Approximately 50 to 70 percent of postpartum women report transient depressed mood or postpartum blues, making them vulnerable to relapse during this time. Women who relapse are more likely to have family members or friends who smoke and report less social support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Most women who are able to quit smoking by themselves during pregnancy do so prior to their first prenatal visit. (See <a href=\"#H2120099851\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of smoking cessation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is expert consensus that pregnant women who use tobacco should be identified early in pregnancy and provided augmented, pregnancy-tailored counseling on smoking cessation. Despite evidence that brief interventions work to reduce maternal smoking, it is estimated that only approximately half of obstetricians routinely advise and provide follow-up for smoking cessation, and only 28 percent discuss actual strategies for cessation. (See <a href=\"#H2278814843\" class=\"local\">'Impact of health care provider intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We refer all women with a clear intention to quit smoking to cessation counseling. We also ask about additional comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, or substance abuse, that can contribute to continued smoking. Women with these issues are referred for further evaluation and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3174513749\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who are not heavy smokers, express that they can do this on their own, or desire medication-free cessation, we encourage a trial of cessation counseling without pharmacotherapy to avoid any potential risks of pharmacotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H1083646807\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who do not feel they can stop on their own or who are heavy smokers, we offer pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to smoking cessation counseling. While both nicotine replacement therapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> are reasonable drug options, the optimal treatment is not known and the patient&rsquo;s preferences help determine the medication choice. (See <a href=\"#H2342569028\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The five A's (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange) provide a general approach to asking patients about cigarette and tobacco use and helping patients stop smoking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50450 \">table 1</a>). The specific action steps have been gathered from various investigators and guideline panels and are not exclusive to pregnant women. Additionally, we address tobacco use at every subsequent prenatal visit to track progress, reinforce success, and provide ongoing assistance to women who continue to smoke. (See <a href=\"#H2923815506\" class=\"local\">'General questions (5 A's) to smoking cessation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although smoking cessation during pregnancy is of maximal benefit if it occurs early in the first trimester, quitting at any time during pregnancy can have some beneficial effects. Women are more likely to be successful if encouraged to quit rather than cut down. (See <a href=\"#H36699589\" class=\"local\">'Abstinence versus reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnant women who want to stop smoking, we recommend smoking-cessation counseling as a first-line treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1083646807\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who have been unable to quit with cessation counseling alone, we suggest adjunct treatment with pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). While both nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> are reasonable drug options, the safety and efficacy of these drugs have not been directly compared in randomized trials including pregnant women; thus, the optimal treatment is not known. Given the limited available data, it is reasonable to offer both NRT and bupropion as adjuncts to cessation counseling and ask the patient to participate in the selection. We believe the benefits of quitting with pharmacotherapy outweigh the potential risks of pharmacotherapy and the risks of continued smoking. (See <a href=\"#H1791400047\" class=\"local\">'Drug use and selection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> for smoking cessation in pregnant women because of the lack of safety information and the availability of alternative drugs. (See <a href=\"#H2802258548\" class=\"local\">'Varenicline'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpartum relapse is a significant problem, with approximately 50 percent of quitters relapsing in the first two months after delivery. These women should be considered &quot;at risk&quot; and provided with ongoing support. (See <a href=\"#H1150713856\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum women'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Tong VT, Dietz PM, Morrow B, et al.
