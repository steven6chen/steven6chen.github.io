Older adults with diabetes are at risk of developing a similar spectrum of macrovascular and microvascular complications as their younger counterparts with diabetes. In addition, they are at high risk for polypharmacy, functional disabilities, and common geriatric syndromes that include cognitive impairment, depression, urinary incontinence, falls, and persistent pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review diabetes management in older patients and how management priorities and treatment choices may differ between older and younger patients. The general management of type 2 diabetes is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall goals of diabetes management in older adults are similar to those in younger adults and include management of both hyperglycemia and risk factors. Older adults with diabetes are a heterogeneous population that includes persons residing independently in communities, in assisted care facilities, or in nursing homes. They can be fit and healthy or frail with many comorbidities and functional disabilities. Thus, management of diabetes in older adults should be individualized, taking into account these variables.</p><p>In frail, older patients with diabetes, avoidance of hypoglycemia, hypotension, and drug interactions due to polypharmacy are of even greater concern than in younger patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, management of coexisting medical conditions is important, as it influences their ability to perform self-management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycemic targets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data specifically addressing optimal glycemic goals in medication-treated older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Goals for glycemic control, as well as risk factor management, should be based upon the individual's overall health and projected period of survival since the risk of complications is duration dependent. The appropriate target for glycated hemoglobin (A1C) in fit, older patients who have a life expectancy of over 10 years should be individualized based on the factors above, on identified patient-specific risks for hypoglycemia, and on the ability of the patients to adopt and adhere to specific treatment regimens. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5140214\" class=\"local\">'Persistent hyperglycemia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of any long-term, clinical trial data in fit older populations, an A1C goal of &lt;7.5 percent (58.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> should be considered in medication-treated patients. To achieve this goal, fasting and preprandial glucoses should be between 140 and 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 to 8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-glycemic-assessment-using-conventional-or-si-units-for-hemoglobin-a1c\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The glycemic goal should be somewhat higher (A1C &le;8.0 percent, fasting and preprandial glucoses between 160 and 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [8.9 to 9.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> in medication-treated, frail, older adults with medical and functional comorbidities and in those whose life expectancy is less than 10 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individualized goals for the very old may be even higher (A1C &lt;8.5 percent) and should include efforts to preserve quality of life and avoid hypoglycemia and related complications.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycemic targets'</a>.)</p><p>Hyperglycemia increases dehydration, impairs vision and cognition, and increases risk of infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], all of which contribute to functional decline and an increased risk of falling in older diabetic patients. On the other hand, older patients may tolerate relatively higher blood glucose levels before they manifest an osmotic diuresis, owing to their lower glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) and lower load of glucose delivered to the tubules for reabsorption. Furthermore, side effects of diabetes treatment, most notably hypoglycemia, can result in poor outcomes, such as traumatic falls and exacerbation of comorbid conditions. The results of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial suggest that intensive therapy in persons at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and especially with polypharmacy, may increase the risk for both total and CVD mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Whether hypoglycemia is the cause of the increased mortality is unclear.</p><p>It is important to note that the measurement of A1C may not be accurate in several situations that are seen frequently in older adults. These include anemia and other conditions that impact red blood cell life span, chronic kidney disease, recent transfusions and erythropoietin infusions, recent acute illness or hospitalizations, and chronic liver diseases. Biologic and patient-specific factors that may cause misleading A1C results are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estimation-of-blood-glucose-control-in-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estimation of blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycated hemoglobin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoiding hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vulnerability to hypoglycemia is substantially increased in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. Older adults may have more neuroglycopenic manifestations of hypoglycemia (dizziness, weakness, delirium, confusion) compared with adrenergic manifestations (tremors, sweating), resulting in delayed recognition of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These neuroglycopenic symptoms may be missed or misconstrued as primary neurologic disease (such as a transient ischemic attack), leading to inappropriate reporting of hypoglycemic episodes by the patients.</p><p>Hypoglycemic episodes in older individuals may also increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac autonomic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In addition, severe hypoglycemia requiring hospitalization has been associated with an increased risk of developing dementia that is higher in patients with repeated episodes, although the direction of causality, if any, is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Even a mild episode of hypoglycemia may lead to adverse outcomes in frail, older patients. As an example, episodes of dizziness or weakness increase the risk of falls and fracture leading to nursing home placement.</p><p>Given the risks, avoidance of hypoglycemia is an important consideration in choosing therapeutic agents and establishing glycemic goals in older adults. Insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylurea and meglitinides, as well all types of insulin, should be used with caution in frail, older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

However, their absolute risk for CVD is much higher than younger adults. Older adults with diabetes suffer excess morbidity and mortality compared with older individuals without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Both diabetes and age are major risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). It is therefore not surprising that CHD is by far the leading cause of death in older patients with diabetes. There are few data specifically addressing optimal cardiovascular risk reduction in older patients. Benefits from lipid lowering and blood pressure control have been extracted from trials in older adults with or without diabetes and from trials in patients with diabetes, which included some older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As with glycemic control, the benefit of cardiovascular risk reduction depends upon the patient's frailty, overall health, and projected period of survival. Older patients are more likely to derive greater reduction in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular risk reduction, particularly lipid lowering with statin therapy, than from tight glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. As reviewed above, the results of the ACCORD trial suggest that intensive glycemic therapy in persons at high risk for cardiovascular disease, and especially with polypharmacy, may increase the risk for both total and CVD mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>As in younger patients with type 2 diabetes, risk reduction should be focused upon the following areas (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of and risk factors for coronary heart disease in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking cessation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of dyslipidemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1488528\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking in patients with diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality, due largely to CVD.

The ACCORD trial found no benefit of adding fenofibrate to statin therapy in patients with diabetes who were at high risk for CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The relative beneficial effects of lipid lowering with statins are similar in older and younger patients with diabetes, and the absolute benefit is typically greater than in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. As with the goal for glycemic control, however, goals for lipid management should be adjusted based upon older patients' life expectancy, comorbidities, cognitive status, and personal preferences. Reductions in events with statin therapy can occur quickly (within weeks to months), and so even in older patients, such therapy can be expected to reduce events during a patient's expected lifespan.

A meta-analysis of a large number of secondary prevention trials found that the absolute benefit of aspirin was greatest in those over age 65 years with diabetes or diastolic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes is less certain.

Weight reduction through diet, exercise, and behavioral modification can be used to improve glycemic control, although the majority of older patients with type 2 diabetes will require medication over the course of their diabetes.

For patients who prefer to avoid medication and who have an A1C near their individualized target, a three- to six-month trial of lifestyle modification before initiating metformin is reasonable. For patients with contraindications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intolerance to metformin, we suggest a short-acting sulfonylurea (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a>) as an alternative option. Other options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repaglinide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">repaglinide</a>, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, or insulin. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The following recommendations are based upon trials carried out in the general population and from clinical experience. They are largely consistent with the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Canadian Diabetes Association, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the European Diabetes Working Party guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/1,5,7-11,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,7-11,30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All older patients with diabetes should receive counseling about lifestyle modification (exercise, diet, behavioral modification, and weight reduction [if needed]). The oldest age group in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (&gt;60 years of age at baseline) had the greatest improvement in glycemia over time, related in part to better adherence to the lifestyle program (a behavioral modification program aimed at a low-fat diet and exercise for 150 minutes per week), compared with the younger age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Older adults should be encouraged to be as active as their functional status will allow. Functionally independent adults should be encouraged to perform 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (eg, brisk walking) at least five days per week. Routine testing by electrocardiogram or cardiac exercise testing is not indicated for most asymptomatic adults prior to initiating moderate physical activity, unless they are at high risk for coronary disease on the basis of multiple risk factors.

In a randomized trial of medical nutrition intervention in adults &ge;65 years of age, patients in the intervention group had significantly greater improvements in fasting plasma glucose (-18.9 versus -1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [-1.05 versus -0.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> and A1C (-0.5 percentage points versus no change) than control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Thus, most older adults with diabetes should be considered for a medical nutrition evaluation. However, unique challenges with aging, such as altered taste perception, coexisting illnesses and dietary restrictions, compromised dentition, altered gastrointestinal function, impaired food shopping and preparation capabilities, and memory decline leading to skipped meals, should be considered before developing meal plans. In general, it is best to avoid complex dietary and treatment regimen in older adults.

However, for patients who present with A1C near their medication-treated target and who prefer to avoid medication, or in whom there are multiple comorbidities and concerns about polypharmacy, a three- to six-month trial of lifestyle modification before initiating metformin is reasonable.</p><p>Insulin can also be considered as initial therapy for all patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly patients presenting with A1C &gt;9 percent (74.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol),</span> fasting plasma glucose &gt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> random glucose consistently &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> or ketonuria.</p><p>There are few data specifically addressing drug therapy in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/8,10,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,38</a>]. However, most diabetes drug trials included a wide range of patients, including those &gt;65 years of age. All of the types of oral hypoglycemic drugs and insulin are safe in older patients, although each has some limitations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56876 \">table 1</a>). In general, oral and injectable agents with low risk of hypoglycemia are preferred in older adults.

The long-term benefits and risks of using one approach over another are unknown. Pharmacologic therapy must be individualized based upon patient abilities and comorbidities. &quot;Start low and go slow&quot; is a good principle to follow when starting any new medications in an older adult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2196469\"><span class=\"h3\">Metformin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most older adults, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> as initial therapy. Metformin is an attractive agent to use in older adults due to a low risk of hypoglycemia. A calculated (or estimated) glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> has been suggested as a safe level of kidney function for the use of metformin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. For a patient with an estimated GFR (eGFR) &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> we prescribe full dose. For patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> we typically reduce the metformin dose by half (no more than 1000 mg per day). Weight loss and gastrointestinal side effects may be limiting factors in older adults taking metformin. Therefore, we typically begin with 500 mg daily and increase the dose slowly over several weeks to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. Extended-release formulation of metformin is tolerated better in those who are unable to tolerate metformin due to gastrointestinal side effects. While the recommendations above are reasonable, there are few studies to establish the therapeutic efficacy or safety with these reduced doses.</p><p>Older patients also are at increased risk for developing other conditions that reduce renal function further or cause lactic acidosis (eg, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, cardiac failure, pneumonia). Therefore, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> should be used with caution in older patients. Any older patient treated with metformin should be cautioned to stop taking the drug immediately if they become ill for any reason or if they are to undergo a procedure requiring the use of iodinated contrast material. In addition, renal function (measurement of serum creatinine and eGFR) should be monitored every three to six months, rather than annually.

The choice of sulfonylurea balances glucose-lowering efficacy, universal local availability, and low cost with risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Sulfonylurea drugs are usually well tolerated. Hypoglycemia is the most common side effect and is more common with long-acting sulfonylurea drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpropamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpropamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glyburide-glibenclamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glyburide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glimepiride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glimepiride</a>), especially in older adults, in whom severe, prolonged hypoglycemia can develop. Thus, we avoid the use of long-acting sulfonylureas in older adults. We prefer to use a short-acting sulfonylurea such as glipizide or glimepiride.

We typically monitor A1C twice yearly in older patients who are meeting treatment goals and who have stable glycemic control, and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals. It is important to look for any conditions that interfere with A1C measurement (eg, anemia, recent infections, renal failure, erythropoietin therapy, etc). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estimation-of-blood-glucose-control-in-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estimation of blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycated hemoglobin'</a>.)</p><p>Blood glucose concentrations can also be monitored at home by the patient or a caregiver. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) can be considered in select older patients, depending upon medications and functional and cognitive abilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. SMBG may be helpful in older patients with type 2 diabetes who take medications that can cause hypoglycemia (eg, insulin). SMBG may also be useful for some patients who would take action to modify eating patterns or exercise, as well as be willing to intensify pharmacotherapy, based on SMBG results. However, SMBG may not be necessary at all, or only in unusual circumstances, for older patients with type 2 diabetes who are diet treated or who are treated with oral agents not associated with hypoglycemia.</p><p>The effectiveness of SMBG in terms of improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is less clear than for type 1 diabetes.

A complete ophthalmologic examination should be performed by a qualified ophthalmologist or optometrist at the time of diagnosis and at least yearly thereafter. The purpose is to screen not only for diabetic retinopathy but also for cataracts and glaucoma, which are more common in older diabetic compared with nondiabetic subjects. Cataracts are over twice as common in people over age 65 years with diabetes compared with similarly-aged, nondiabetic subjects (38.4 versus 16.6 percent), while glaucoma is almost three times more common (11.2 versus 3.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of effective therapy for diabetic nephropathy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has led to the recommendation that all patients with diabetes be screened for increased urinary albumin excretion annually.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While good glycemic control prevents progression of some diabetes complications and therefore may decrease the risk of falls, hypoglycemia that occurs as a result of intensive glycemic control may increase the risk of falls. In a prospective, observational study of 446 older adults with diabetes (mean age 74 years), intensive glycemic control (A1C &le;6 versus &gt;8 percent) was associated with an increased risk of falls in insulin users (odds ratio [OR] 4.4, 95% CI 1.3-14.5) but not in those treated with oral agents (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.7-2.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Potential reasons for the discrepancy include a greater duration or severity of diabetes or a greater number of hypoglycemic episodes in patients treated with insulin versus oral agents, possibilities which were not rigorously explored in this observational study.</p><p>Nevertheless, the benefits of improved glycemic control to reduce diabetes-related complications (and decrease risk of falls) must be balanced with the possible increased risk of falls with intensive insulin therapy. These findings support the use of less rigorous glycemic goals in older adults (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic targets'</a> above). In addition, identifying the causes of falls and initiating exercise programs may reduce the risk of falls in these individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes increases a woman's risk of developing urinary incontinence.

Older adults with diabetes are a heterogeneous population that includes persons residing independently in communities, in assisted care facilities, or in nursing homes. They can be fit and healthy or frail with many comorbidities and functional disabilities. Thus, management of diabetes in older adults should be individualized, taking into account these variables. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals for glycemic control, as well as risk factor management, should be individualized based upon the individual's overall health, risk for hypoglycemia, and projected period of survival since the risk of complications is duration dependent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic targets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vulnerability to hypoglycemia is substantially increased in older adults. Thus, avoidance of hypoglycemia is an important consideration in establishing goals and choosing therapeutic agents in older adults.

(See <a href=\"#H1488510\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular risk reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients with diabetes should receive individualized counseling regarding lifestyle modification, including a medical nutrition evaluation.

It is likely that metformin will safely reduce glycemia at any level and may either reduce progression of hyperglycemia or reduce the likelihood that a patient will develop diabetes-related complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternative option for patients who present with A1C near their medication-treated target and who prefer to avoid medication is a three- to six-month trial of lifestyle modification before initiating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>.

Since they are relatively weak agents and usually lower A1C levels by only 0.6 percent, DPP-4 inhibitors should only be used as monotherapy when the A1C level is relatively close to the goal level. DPP-4 inhibitors have no risk of hypoglycemia and are weight neutral when used as monotherapy. However, the long-term safety with this class of drug has not been established, and they are relatively expensive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If glycemic goals are not met with a single agent, the older patient should be evaluated for contributing causes, such as difficulty adhering to the medication, side effects, or poor understanding of the nutrition plan. In addition, they should be screened for age-related barriers such as cognitive or functional decline, depression, and socioeconomic factors (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Common geriatric syndromes associated with diabetes'</a> above). If glycemic control is still above target, an additional agent is needed.

We suggest adding a short-acting sulfonylurea such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Alternative options include adding basal insulin (preferred in those with A1C &gt;9 percent [74.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol]</span> or with persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repaglinide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">repaglinide</a>, a DPP-4 inhibitor, or a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.

For such patients with A1C above glycemic targets but &le;8.5 percent, there are a number of agents that are available and can be used with a sulfonylurea (as an alternative to switching to basal insulin). Options include DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. All of these medications have advantages and disadvantages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56876 \">table 1</a>).
