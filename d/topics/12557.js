It encompasses the individual&rsquo;s search for meaning and purpose in life and the experience of the transcendent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Spirituality also encompasses the connections one makes with others, his or herself, nature, and to the sacred realms, inside as well as outside of traditional religion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Viewed in this way, spirituality is an important component of quality of life (QOL) and may be a key factor in how people cope with illness, experience healing, and achieve a sense of coherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis of chronic or life-threatening illness can lead to spiritual struggles for patients. The turmoil may be short for some patients and protracted for others as individuals attempt to make sense of the reality of their diagnosis with what gives them value and meaning in life. The journey may result in growth and transformation for some people, distress and despair for others, and both for many people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Spiritual care is an essential domain of palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This topic will provide an overview of key spiritual issues in palliative care, describe approaches to spiritual assessment in the clinical setting, and propose a way to integrate treatment of spiritual distress into a palliative care treatment or care plan. Specific discussions on the incorporation of palliative care with regard to various religious traditions (eg, Catholicism, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, or Islam, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]) are beyond the scope of this topic. For more information regarding their role in clinical care, the clinician is advised to seek input from their local and institutionally based chaplaincy services. </p><p>A discussion about the influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes (ie, health care decision-making, QOL) in palliative care patients is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H884321232\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For purposes of this discussion, the following definitions will apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palliative care</strong> is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, impeccable assessment, and treatment of pain and suffering, including psychosocial, spiritual, and existential suffering, as well as physical pain. The field of palliative care is broadly defined as applying to patients from the time of diagnosis of a serious or life-threatening illness until death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care#H549034653\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spirituality</strong> can be defined as an individual&rsquo;s relationship to and experience of transcendence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] or the individual&rsquo;s sense of peace, purpose, and interconnectedness, including existential concerns and beliefs about the meaning of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because of the need to standardize a definition for spirituality in palliative care, a group of interprofessional experts in palliative and spiritual care produced a consensus definition of spirituality as &ldquo;the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose, and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It may include religion and other worldviews but encompasses far more general ways these experiences are expressed, including through the arts, relationships with nature and others, and for some, through the concept of secular humanism, the latter of which emphasizes reason, scientific inquiry, individual freedom and responsibility, human values, compassion, and the needs for tolerance and cooperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Religion</strong> is a formal structure through which a person expresses spirituality within a community. A religious community is then organized around common beliefs, attitudes, practices, traditions, and relationships. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spiritual care</strong> is defined as interventions, individual or communal, that facilitate the ability to express the integration of the body, mind, and spirit to achieve wholeness, health, and a sense of connection to self, others, <span class=\"nowrap\">and[/or]</span> a higher power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>The relationship between spirituality and health has gained increased attention over the last two decades in the United States and internationally. Spirituality (which includes religious and existential aspects of care) is one of eight specific domains of quality within palliative care, endorsed by the National Consensus Project (NCP) for Quality Palliative Care and numerous national organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Illness can be seen as an injury to the wholeness of the human being, affecting the interrelated biologic, psychological, interpersonal, and spiritual dimensions of human experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Healing is seen as the restoration of these disruptions in both self-functioning and in relationships. It also asserts that the goal of any treatment must address the totality of the patient, including spiritual wellbeing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>As patients approach the end of life, healing takes on greater significance. Despite our inability to ameliorate the patient&rsquo;s disease, relief of suffering can be accomplished by focusing on other domains associated with the value and meaning of life; healing takes on broader significance as the patient approaches the end of life. Despite the inability to <strong>physically</strong><em> </em>cure the patient in palliative care (particularly as they move closer to death), attention to the issues associated with the value and meaning of life, suffering, and death become important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], including attention to physical suffering, psychological wellbeing, and strengthening of relationships with self and with the significant or sacred, however people understand that, which might include a relationship with God or another higher power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14620056\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLUENCE OF SPIRITUALITY IN PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A growing body of literature supports the notion that spiritual care is a patient need and common quality of life (QOL) concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/6,7,10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10,13</a>]. The data also suggest that patients&rsquo; spiritual, religious, and cultural beliefs affect health care decision-making and health care outcomes, including coping and QOL and pain management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients#H88596558\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients&quot;, section on 'Religiousness and healthcare decision making'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients#H22162325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients&quot;, section on 'Impact of spirituality/religion on quality of life outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>Increasing evidence demonstrates that spiritual distress is a significant aspect of overall distress in palliative care patients, and that spiritual resources of strength are also important to assess. One study involving 491 patients with lung cancer and 366 family caregivers tested a palliative care intervention which included spiritual wellbeing as one of four QOL domains of the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].&nbsp;The intervention led to improvements in several key areas of spiritual wellbeing. The study also supports the multidimensionality of spirituality, which includes constructs such as meaning and faith in both religious and nonreligious patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14620274\"><span class=\"h2\">Spiritual needs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As they approach the end of life, patients experience a myriad of struggles and needs, not all of which are tied to God or a formal religion but which have been described as &ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo; This was illustrated in a qualitative study that included 19 hospice patients (range of time in hospice was 2 weeks to 12 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] who identified a total of 29 spiritual needs, which were grouped into six themes: need for religion, want of companionship, need to be involved and in control, desire to finish business, need to experience nature, and the need of a positive outlook. Spiritual needs tend to be similar across all diseases. In one study of patients with end-stage heart failure, these related to love and belonging, hope, coping, meaning and purpose, faith and belief, and making the most of their time left [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar spiritual needs have been reported among patients with advanced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. More importantly, addressing spiritual needs may impact resource utilization. A study of cancer patients found that supporting patients&rsquo; spiritual needs resulted in more hospice usage and less aggressive end of life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In another study of inpatients with advanced cancer, patients whose spiritual needs were addressed were less likely to die in an intensive care unit and more likely to spend a greater amount of time in hospice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The majority of patients with serious illness want their spiritual issues addressed in their care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients cite a variety of reasons including increased trust in their physician, feeling that their wishes are respected, feeling the realistic hope can be encouraged, that their spiritual beliefs help them cope with their illness, and that it gives them a sense of meaning in their lives. Meeting these needs may influence health care utilization, especially as patients approach the end of life. A study of cancer patients found that supporting their spiritual needs resulted in more hospice usage and less aggressive end of life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a separate study involving patients with advanced cancer, those with a spiritual issue reported during the hospital stay and had that issue addressed were also less likely to die in an intensive care unit (ICU) and likely to spend more time in hospice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14620370\"><span class=\"h2\">Spirituality and health care decision-making</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have reported that spirituality <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> religion may be important to cancer patients and may influence medical decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. </p><p>Religious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spiritual beliefs are particularly important in end of life decisions. Personal philosophies may also impact decision-making. For example, a naturalist may decline medications in favor of dietary and other interventions. Patients may also delay treatment choices in order to participate in spiritual rituals such as celebration of the solstice in the woods, or participation in a religious ceremony [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The available data suggest that spirituality or religious beliefs and practices can profoundly impact how patients cope with the suffering that so often accompanies a serious life-threatening illness, but the impact may be negative or positive:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 31 palliative care patients experiencing moderate distress with major physical and psychosocial symptom burden, the majority identified themselves as at least somewhat spiritual, with 77 percent admitting to being at least somewhat religious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Negative religious coping (ie, statements regarding disease as punishment or an indicator of abandonment by God) was associated with higher levels of distress, confusion, and depression, and lower levels of physical and emotional wellbeing, and QOL. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most data examining the influence of spiritual coping on outcomes come from studies of patients with advanced malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,29</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a 2006 systematic review of the literature that included 17 reports (all in patients with cancer), seven noted a positive impact on QOL among those who reported spiritual or religious coping, three found religious coping to be associated with detrimental effects, and the remaining seven studies found no impact on outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, as the authors pointed out, methodological issues (ie, differences in how coping was measured, lack of control of other variables that impact cancer-related outcomes such as disease stage, perceived social support) limit the interpretability of these data. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A more contemporary study published in 2012 reported a positive impact of spirituality on QOL among patients undergoing palliative radiation therapy for advanced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The impact of positive coping remained significant after controlling for other variables that impact cancer-related outcomes (eg, sex, age, race, and disease variables). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In other studies, cancer patients report that their spirituality is a source of strength that helps them cope, find meaning in their lives, and make sense of the cancer experience as they recover from treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/15,16,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,30-33</a>].</p><p/><p>However, the importance of spirituality in coping has been shown in other diseases, including motor neuron disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A growing body of research also suggests that spiritual coping is associated with positive health outcomes in patients with sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], HIV infection and AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and in patients with heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H884322355\"><span class=\"h2\">Spiritual wellbeing and quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spiritual wellbeing is the opposite construct of spiritual distress. Theoretically, spiritual wellbeing has an impact on QOL because it can impact other QOL dimensions, including the physical, psychological, and interpersonal, or emotional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/12,30,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,30,40</a>]. As an example, in one trial that included 103 patients with advanced cancer, spiritual wellbeing (as measured by the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment scale) was strongly associated with overall QOL, mental wellbeing, physical wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, and social wellbeing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These data suggest that supporting spiritual wellbeing may be useful, especially as patients approach the end of life. Spirituality is associated with an improved QOL for those with chronic and serious illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], which appears to hold true regardless of life expectancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A study of patients with cancer who had high levels of spiritual wellbeing reported more enjoyment in life, and higher levels of meaning and peace, even in the midst of cancer-related symptoms such as fatigue or pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. For patients living with cancer, spirituality has been associated with hope, gratitude, and positivity in their cancer experience. Cancer patients report their spirituality helped them find hope, gratitude, and positivity in their cancer experience, and that their spirituality is a source of strength that helps them cope, find meaning in their lives, and make sense of the cancer experience as they recover from treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/15,16,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,30-33</a>].</p><p>Other studies have shown that spiritual wellbeing in cancer patients has been associated with lower levels of depression, better QOL near death, and protection against end of life despair and desire for hastened death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

The NCC supports the use of spiritual distress categories for several reasons. First, some degree of medicalization is necessary to ensure it is integrated as a dimension of the routine care of these patients. Second, in order to treat and support spiritual suffering, further classification of that suffering is needed to provide more holistic and appropriate care for the patients. Evidence of spiritual distress should prompt referral to chaplains for further assessment. A table is provided that includes spiritual distress categories, as well as the proposed diagnosis or issue listed with sample features from the history and examples of statements patients may say (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F95002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95002 \">table 1</a>).

Spiritual distress might also present clinically as anger, low self-esteem, uncontrollable pain, or other symptoms. The incidence of spiritual distress ranges, with estimates between 40 and 73 percent reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. While specific to patients with cancer, we believe this definition also applies to patients with other medical conditions, where the prevalence is likely to be as high. The prevalence may be particularly high among military veterans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Studies have found patients with chronic illness, cancer, or those who are older adults who experience spiritual distress are at risk for poorer health outcomes, including worse physical health, worse QOL, and greater depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/3,24,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24,45,46</a>]. Patients who report long-standing spiritual or religious struggles were at greater risk of disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], higher indices of pain and fatigue, and more difficulties with daily physical functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although more limited data are available, spiritual distress may also predict a greater mortality risk, even when controlling for demographic, physical health, and mental health factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These findings suggest that addressing spiritual struggle might improve health care outcomes.</p><p>There are overlaps between spiritual distress and psychological distress and disorders, and patients vary on how these issues are discussed. All patients presenting with intense distress require a differential diagnosis to ascertain whether a psychological disorder (depression, unresolved grief, anxiety disorder, etc) is a primary driver or secondary result of spiritual distress. Similarly, mental health assessments require attention to spiritual issues that may be contributing to emotional suffering. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1662647145\"><span class=\"h3\">Differentiating spiritual, existential, and psychological suffering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lines differentiating spiritual distress, existential distress, and psychological distress are not clear. Different patients use different language for describing distress, some speaking more psychologically, others using more spiritual references, and others from an existential framework. Effective care requires open-minded and open-ended efforts to understand these multiple ways of thinking about and experiencing distress. Effective exploration requires eliciting and responding to the patient&rsquo;s framework and language. </p><p>It is also important to use clinical discernment to distinguish the source of the distress. As an example, a patient with major depression and spiritual or existential distress may benefit from referrals to both a mental health professional and a chaplain. Patients who are struggling with questions such as &ldquo;Why is this happening to me? What is the meaning of my suffering?&rdquo; may be asking a spiritual or psychological question, or may be viewing their distress within an existential framework. Four existential domains are recognized through which existential suffering can manifest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F112202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112202 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Exploring the patient&rsquo;s concerns using the patient&rsquo;s framework is critical to good care. Including different members of the health care team to address the patient&rsquo;s distress based on a full assessment, and utilizing a person-centered approach are appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H1823005525\" class=\"local\">'Interprofessional collaboration'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients do not usually disclose <span class=\"nowrap\">spiritual/psychological/existential</span> suffering unless the clinician asks about it. A tool to aid health care providers in the diagnosis of existential suffering involves simply asking the patient, &ldquo;Are you at peace?&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This very broad question allows patients to respond within their own framework, whether it is spiritual, psychological, or existential. A &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer should prompt further exploration for signs of distress and the nature of the distress, which may clarify whether referral to a chaplain or mental health clinician is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, some patients may answer that they are at peace but still have spiritual distress, such as hopelessness. Therefore, a specific spiritual distress assessment is recommended as part of a thorough clinical history. (See <a href=\"#H1823004826\" class=\"local\">'Spiritual screening'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14621050\"><span class=\"h1\">SPIRITUAL STRENGTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spirituality also may present as a source of strength for patients and is sometimes referred to as an inner strength. Examples include the ability to find meaning, seek forgiveness or to forgive, or having a strong spiritual community involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Another example of spiritual strength may be a patient&rsquo;s connection to God or the sacred. Spiritual strengths may help patients cope, find hope in the midst of suffering, find joy in life, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> find the ability to be grateful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Finally, some practices such as meditation, mindfulness, or prayer may be a resource of strength for patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H427461973\"><span class=\"h1\">INTEGRATING SPIRITUALITY INTO PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To better inform the practical incorporation of spiritual care into palliative care, a US National Consensus Conference (NCC) developed a model of implementation of spiritual care that integrates dignity-centered and compassionate care into the biopsychosocial framework that is the basis of palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fundamental to this model is the recognition of the role of all clinicians to attend to the whole person &ndash; body, mind, and spirit. This includes the obligation of all clinicians to attend to all dimensions of the suffering of a patient and family and to elicit the patient&rsquo;s spiritual needs and then respect those beliefs and struggles. </p><p>This model has two main components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician-patient relationship &ndash; This is a relational component whereby spiritual care builds on the relationship between the clinician and patient and acknowledges the patient&rsquo;s serious illness. Inherent to this aspect of spiritual care is the practice of compassionate presence, which can be characterized as being fully present with another as a witness to their own experience. The experience of compassionate presence by the clinician to the patient may result in a sense of healing by the patient within the context of the relationship with the clinician. This was described by the consensus conference as the concept of a transformational healing relationship. Healing may be finding meaning, hope, or a sense of coherence in the midst of their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical assessment and treatment of spiritual distress &ndash; The NCC defined spiritual care in two domains. One is assessment and treatment of spiritual distress. In this model, chaplains, who are ideally <a href=\"http://bcci.professionalchaplains.org/content.asp?pl=25&contentid=25&amp;token=DreiRp5KFKgAzbgnYGplj0J4oNSsR/aROrI3KkuMLY3qDWmM1++MGySF/RUBqs4apXMkqoDbG5gsSJb9VxrbzAHF2T5Vilr8NAnx865aPV8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2198\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">board-certified or board-eligible</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], serve as spiritual care specialists, with the non-chaplain clinicians providing generalist spiritual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, all clinicians should address patients&rsquo; spirituality, identify and treat spiritual distress, and support spiritual resources of strength. In-depth spiritual counseling and exploration should be referred to the chaplain. In addition, spiritual care refers to provision of compassionate care or presence to patients by the clinician.

For those clinicians who are not comfortable praying or participating in rituals, stepping aside once the chaplain is present or being present and witnessing this important ritual represent two reasonable options.</p><p>Practical tools and recommendations for the integration of spirituality as an essential element of palliative care are available from the <a href=\"https://smhs.gwu.edu/gwish/clinical/integrating-spirituality&amp;token=qX30+Bz/18m4YGAVBwvv6VYq6Qzajlow2R1Sg9IVbSQO6+ieOqEpfZufMoB1ebTIch/l0z5a5lS4xLCJJXcJOA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2198\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GW Institute for Spirituality and Health (GWish)</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H960250848\"><span class=\"h1\">SPIRITUALITY AT THE END OF LIFE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common goal for the dying patient, family members, and the health care professional is for a meaningful dying experience. Meaning, however, is patient centered and not provider centered. Thus, for some patients, loss might be reframed in the context of a life legacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. For others, meaning might be in reconciliation with a higher power or in doing a life review and finding meaning in significant moments of one&rsquo;s life. However, not all patients are able to frame their goals in these terms. </p><p>Concerns about symptoms and family wellbeing are usually paramount. Reconciliation with loved ones or with God and peacefulness are commonly additional goals for this phase of life. The clinician&rsquo;s role is to help the patient identify their own goals of care in light of their medical condition, treatment options, and prognosis and to develop a care plan that addresses the patient&rsquo;s goals of care &ndash; spiritual, psychosocial, as well as physical goals &ndash; and to help put in place a personalized plan that respects what is most meaningful to the patient. Engaging the spiritual resources of the patient, either through the institution or the community, can provide comfort, not only to the patient but to the family, as well. </p><p>A practical guide for discussing and managing spiritual issues that arise during end of life care is available from a working group on religious and spiritual issues at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Important points include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should be aware that decisions around life-sustaining treatment may be heavily influenced by the patient&rsquo;s <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> their loved ones&rsquo;) spiritual or religious beliefs. Therefore, it is important to explore these beliefs in order to help patients think through preferences around specific interventions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients may not openly express spiritual, existential, or religious concerns, despite being troubled by them. Clinicians should listen to patients empathetically so that they might be able to learn and understand what these concerns are. This should be done without trying to alleviate the spiritual suffering or by providing premature (or false) reassurances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End of life decisions can be very difficult for patients. It is important that the clinician respectfully shares prognostic data but in a way that honors each patient&rsquo;s uniqueness and does not take away a sense of hope and meaning for the patient. The clinician should respond by listening to the patient, aiming for a better understanding of the patient&rsquo;s viewpoint, and by helping the patient understand the medical realities of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> situation and what treatment can and cannot achieve, recognizing that scientific data are one part of a larger understanding of the patient&rsquo;s illness and what that means to the patient. Thus, a goals of care discussion must be centered on what the patient and family value most, what their spiritual beliefs or values are, what their preferences are in the context of their illness, and how best to honor that for the patient. </p><p/><p>Suffering of patients and families is often challenging for clinicians as many clinicians are trained to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; and attempt to resolve distress for patients. Not all suffering can be fixed. Clinicians cannot find and assign goals or legacy building for a patient. Most patients simply need to be heard fully by a compassionate clinician or chaplain who can be present to the patient&rsquo;s suffering and pain. Most patients can find answers for themselves within the process of sharing their feelings and their pain with a caring clinician. This requires the clinician to be able to listen compassionately without an agenda, often in silence, to the pain of others and, in so doing, create an environment of trust where the patient feels safe to share his or her deepest concerns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823005618\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spirituality is a fundamental element of human experience. It encompasses the individual&rsquo;s search for meaning and purpose in life and the experience of the transcendent. (See <a href=\"#H427461945\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship between spirituality and health has gained increased attention over the last two decades in the United States and internationally. Spirituality (which includes religious and existential aspects of care) is one of eight specific domains of quality within palliative care, endorsed by the National Consensus Project (NCP) for Quality Palliative Care and numerous national organizations. (See <a href=\"#H884321232\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing evidence demonstrates that spiritual distress is a significant aspect of overall distress in palliative care patients. The available data suggest that spirituality and religious beliefs and practices can profoundly impact how patients cope with the suffering that often accompanies a serious life-threatening illness; the impact of these beliefs may be positive (better spiritual wellbeing) or negative (spiritual distress). (See <a href=\"#H14620056\" class=\"local\">'Influence of spirituality in palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Religion and spirituality can also influence health care decision-making (including utilization of health care resources) and quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients#H88596558\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients&quot;, section on 'Religiousness and healthcare decision making'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients#H22162325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients&quot;, section on 'Impact of spirituality/religion on quality of life outcomes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All health care professionals should be trained in doing a spiritual screening or history. (See <a href=\"#H1823004826\" class=\"local\">'Spiritual screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spiritual<strong> </strong>screenings, histories, and assessments should be communicated and documented in patient records (eg, charts, computerized databases) and shared with the interprofessional health care team. The interprofessional team should include chaplains, many of whom are <a href=\"http://bcci.professionalchaplains.org/content.asp?pl=25&contentid=25&amp;token=DreiRp5KFKgAzbgnYGplj0J4oNSsR/aROrI3KkuMLY3qDWmM1++MGySF/RUBqs4apXMkqoDbG5gsSJb9VxrbzAHF2T5Vilr8NAnx865aPV8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2198\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">board-certified</a>. (See <a href=\"#H1823004833\" class=\"local\">'Spiritual history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients, treatment or care plans should include referral to trained spiritual care providers, as appropriate, development of spiritual goals, and interventions to address any spiritual or existential issues. (See <a href=\"#H1823005098\" class=\"local\">'Spiritual assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with other aspects of palliative care, interprofessional collaboration is important when it comes to addressing spirituality. All members of the interprofessional team interact with patients, including responding to and addressing all dimensions of patient care: spiritual, religious, and existential, as well as the physical, psychological, and social. Each of these components of care provides insight into the patient&rsquo;s suffering and his or her ability to manage that suffering. (See <a href=\"#H1823005525\" class=\"local\">'Interprofessional collaboration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lines differentiating spiritual, existential, and psychological distress are not clear. Different patients use different language for describing distress, some speaking more psychologically, others using more spiritual references, and others from an existential framework. Effective care requires open-minded and open-ended efforts to understand these multiple ways of thinking and use clinical discernment to distinguish the source of the distress. As an example, a patient with major depression and spiritual or existential distress may benefit from referrals to both a mental health professional and a <a href=\"http://bcci.professionalchaplains.org/content.asp?pl=25&contentid=25&amp;token=DreiRp5KFKgAzbgnYGplj0J4oNSsR/aROrI3KkuMLY3qDWmM1++MGySF/RUBqs4apXMkqoDbG5gsSJb9VxrbzAHF2T5Vilr8NAnx865aPV8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2198\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">board-certified or board-eligible chaplain</a>. (See <a href=\"#H1662647145\" class=\"local\">'Differentiating spiritual, existential, and psychological suffering'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common goal for the dying patient, family members, and the health care professional is for a meaningful dying experience. Meaning, however, is patient centered and not provider centered.
