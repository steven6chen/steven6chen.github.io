Resuscitative thoracotomy is nearly always performed in the emergency department and involves gaining rapid access to the heart and major thoracic vessels through an anterolateral chest incision to control exsanguinating hemorrhage or other life-threatening chest injuries. The first successful resuscitative thoracotomy was described for the resuscitation of a patient with penetrating cardiac injury and this indication remains the one associated with the highest rate of survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will briefly review the indications for resuscitative (emergency) thoracotomy, which are discussed more fully in separate reviews, and discuss the technique of resuscitative thoracotomy. The initial resuscitation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of the trauma patient with blunt or penetrating trauma is based upon protocols from the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. The initial evaluation and resuscitation of the patient with blunt or penetrating abdominal or thoracic trauma is discussed elsewhere.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197313272\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR THORACOTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resuscitative thoracotomy is restricted to patients with specific indications as determined by the patient's clinical status en route and immediately upon arrival to the emergency department, the mechanism of injury, or the need to perform therapeutic maneuvers to manage correctable causes of shock, including decompressing cardiac tamponade, cross-clamping the aorta, managing exsanguinating cardiac or vascular injuries, and evacuating air embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Compliance is typically better for penetrating compared with blunt trauma (74 versus 45 percent, in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24289990\"><span class=\"h2\">Penetrating injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resuscitative thoracotomy is justified in patients with penetrating thoracic trauma who are hemodynamically unstable on arrival to the emergency department despite appropriate fluid resuscitation, or in patients who have been pulseless and receiving CPR for less than 15 minutes, but only if appropriate resources (eg, operating room, appropriately trained surgeon) are available for continued resuscitation and definitive repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

These indications are discussed in detail elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81674\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81674 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Retrospective reviews report survival that ranges from 14 to 42 percent in patients with severe penetrating abdominal injuries who underwent thoracic aortic clamping prior to abdominal exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. However, controlled comparisons are lacking. In one of these reviews, hemorrhagic shock was due to major abdominal vascular (75 percent) or severe liver (25 percent) injuries, and all required massive blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sixteen percent of the patients survived hospitalization neurologically intact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24290614\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with blunt injury, resuscitative thoracotomy is likely to be futile if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient requires &gt;10 minutes of prehospital CPR</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has no signs of life at the scene of injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has massive, nonsurvivable injuries</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1247118564\"><span class=\"h1\">THORACIC ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thorax is the area of the body between the base of the neck superiorly, and the diaphragm inferiorly. The thorax contains the heart, lungs and major vascular structures including the aorta, arch vessels (brachiocephalic, carotid, and subclavian arteries), and descending thoracic aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is covered by a thin layer of parietal pleura that must be divided to expose the aorta.</p><p>The aortic root is a midline structure and the heart is normally positioned in the left chest with the apex of the left ventricle at the left mid-clavicular line. The arch of the aorta sweeps from the midline posteriorly to the left, and the descending thoracic aorta lays adjacent the spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86026\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86026 \">figure 1</a>). The arch of the aorta and great vessels are located beneath the manubrium of the sternum. </p><p>Normal arch anatomy consists of three branches; the brachiocephalic trunk, which gives off the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries; the left common carotid artery; and the left subclavian artery. Variations of the aortic arch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54048\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54048 \">figure 2</a>) occur in approximately 17 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The most common variation is a bovine arch with the left common carotid artery arising from a larger than usual brachiocephalic trunk. </p><p>The pericardial sac surrounds and protects the heart. The left phrenic and vagus nerves pass anterior to the aortic arch in proximity to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The left phrenic nerve is adherent to the lateral surface of the pericardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52752\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52752 \">figure 3</a>) and is particularly susceptible to inadvertent injury during resuscitative thoracotomy. The left vagus nerve gives rise to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which encircles the aortic arch just medial to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The left vagus nerve travels posterior to the root of the left lung and then adjacent the esophagus as it descends in the posterior mediastinum. Due to its posterior location, it is less vulnerable to injury compared with the phrenic nerve. </p><p>The esophagus is located on the anterior surface of the spine and medial to the aorta. The thoracic duct ascends along the anterolateral surface of the spine, is virtually invisible, and is susceptible to traumatic avulsion that can result in chylothorax. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1247118578\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the decision has been made to open the chest, one member of the trauma team should be designated to lead the ongoing resuscitation effort while an experienced member of the trauma team is performing the thoracotomy. The team leader must be easily identified and should present a calm but authoritative demeanor. Personnel not actively engaged in a specific function directed by the team leader should be asked to leave the room. All personnel should be reminded to minimize unnecessary conversations and to remain calm and purposeful. Iatrogenic injury due to haste, inattention, or an overly chaotic environment must be minimized to improve the likelihood of a satisfactory outcome.</p><p>While intubation and large-bore intravenous access are underway, patients with penetrating injuries should be completely disrobed and quickly rolled in both directions to locate all entrance and exit wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Dual-lumen endotracheal intubation is not recommended in the emergency setting. A nasogastric or orogastric tube should be placed to aid localization when clamping the aorta. (See <a href=\"#H1247118616\" class=\"local\">'Aortic cross-clamping'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior to resuscitative thoracotomy, a right chest tube should ideally be placed prophylactically in the event of inadvertent entry into the right pleural space. Practically speaking, it may also be placed by another member of the trauma team simultaneous with the thoracotomy procedure and should not delay the thoracotomy. </p><p>The patient is positioned supine, with the arms placed on arm boards laterally. The skin is prepared using iodine solution poured liberally over the entire thorax. Sterile drapes are applied, but, in practice, a sterile field is rarely achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24289882\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment and supplies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sterile thoracotomy tray (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86655\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86655 \">picture 1</a>) should be available in the trauma room at all times. The tray should include sterile drapes and towels, laparotomy sponges, and appropriate instruments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86656\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86656 \">table 1</a>) including a scalpel holder and scalpel blades, scissors, rib spreader, aortic cross clamps, a variety of other hemostatic clamps, tissue forceps, sutures, Teflon pledgets and needle drivers. A Foley catheter (5-cc balloon) may also be available for temporizing control of hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H1247118637\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage control and repair'</a> below.) </p><p>Lighting and suction are frequently inadequate in the emergency setting. Every effort should be made to assure that an overhead surgical light or headlight is available, and that effective wall suction is nearby. Operating room personnel may be helpful if available. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4649316\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are recommended prior to cardiothoracic surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87205 \">table 2</a>). However, the procedure should not be delayed for antibiotic administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4649357\"><span class=\"h2\">Universal precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resuscitative thoracotomy is associated with significant blood splatter in often unpredictable directions. Given the increased of risk of exposure to blood-borne disease in the trauma setting, we agree with ATLS recommendations that all personnel involved in the care of the trauma patient should observe universal precautions wearing gowns, gloves and eye protection at all times. Any personnel not immediately involved in the thoracotomy procedure should stand away from the table to minimize their risk of exposure. After the procedure is completed, particular care should be exercised with disposal of sharp instruments.

The estimated seroprevalence of HIV in injured patients in emergency departments in the United States is between 0.5 and 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Hep B and C seroprevalence rates may be higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/18,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25-27</a>]. In one series evaluating these diseases in penetrating trauma patients, the subset of patients most likely to undergo resuscitative thoracotomy, infection with HIV or hepatitis was present in 9.4 percent. The prevalence of HIV was 1.2 percent, the prevalence of Hep B antigen was 0.6 percent, and the prevalence of Hep C was 7.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/18,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,26,27</a>]. The risk of infection following occupational exposure to HIV is relatively low (0.3 percent). Hepatitis is more readily transmitted through occupational exposure with transmission rates for Hep B ranging from 6 to 30 percent and transmission rates for Hep C ranging from 0 to 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536270443\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the technique of resuscitative thoracotomy is relatively straightforward, the procedure is often performed by those who don't routinely perform elective thoracotomy. A systematic approach can help the practitioner avoid pitfalls and optimize patient outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108024991\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the indications for resuscitative thoracotomy (ie, patient in extremis with loss of vital signs), the steps are generally performed in a defined order, which is discussed in more detail below. However, the clinical presentation of the patient or the nature of a specific injury may make one step take precedence over another. As an example, aortic cross-clamping may take precedence over pericardiotomy in the patient with exsanguinating hemorrhage from an aortic rent. In general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incision is made, the chest is entered, and a retractor is placed. (See <a href=\"#H108020288\" class=\"local\">'Incision'</a> below and <a href=\"#H108022140\" class=\"local\">'Opening the chest'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage control maneuvers are used to manage hemorrhage that will impede performance of pericardiotomy or aortic cross-clamping. (See <a href=\"#H108028383\" class=\"local\">'Damage control'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pericardial sac is opened and temporizing measures are used to control any cardiac injuries, if present. Air embolism is managed if identified. (See <a href=\"#H108022308\" class=\"local\">'Pericardiotomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1247118637\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage control and repair'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1247118651\" class=\"local\">'Identifying and evacuating air embolism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aorta is cross-clamped to allow filling of the heart and facilitate ongoing fluid resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H1247118616\" class=\"local\">'Aortic cross-clamping'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open cardiac massage is initiated once the heart has filled sufficiently. (See <a href=\"#H1247118630\" class=\"local\">'Open cardiac massage and internal defibrillation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thoracic structures are systematically explored, looking for any additional bleeding or hematoma formation that might suggest underlying injury. (See <a href=\"#H1247118637\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage control and repair'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108020288\"><span class=\"h2\">Incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is supine and both arms are extended on armboards. Large-bore intravenous access is essential. A generous, left anterolateral thoracotomy, which exposes the heart, lungs, descending aorta, and esophagus, is most often chosen. If massive bleeding from a right chest injury is suspected, then an initially right-sided approach may be taken. If needed, the thoracotomy incision can be extended across the sternum to the right (or left) as a clamshell incision, using a Lebsche knife [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The clamshell incision greatly improves access to the anterior mediastinum, aortic arch, and great vessels. It is critical that the internal mammary arteries be controlled after the sternum is divided to prevent iatrogenic hemorrhage. A posterolateral thoracotomy approach is <strong>not</strong> used in emergency circumstances because of the necessity to position the patient in a lateral decubitus position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>For anterolateral thoracotomy, the skin incision is made with a #10 blade from the margin of the sternum along the intercostal space between the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> ribs (4<sup>th</sup> interspace), or 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> ribs (5<sup>th</sup> interspace) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86029 \">figure 4</a>), below the nipple and carried laterally to the left posterior axillary line, following the curve of the rib. In the female patient, the breast should be retracted superiorly. The skin and subcutaneous fat are incised sharply with the scalpel. In thin patients, the initial incision can be carried directly down to one of the ribs.</p><p>For patients who arrive in the emergency department with an offending penetrating object (eg, knife blade) in situ, the object should generally be left in place, unless it interferes with performing the thoracotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108022140\"><span class=\"h2\">Opening the chest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thoracic cavity is entered laterally (away from the heart) by making a small (1 to 2 cm) incision along the superior margin of the underlying rib to avoid injury to the intercostal neurovascular bundle, which is located along the inferior margin of the rib (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59415\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59415 \">figure 5</a>). The pleura immediately beneath the muscles is likewise divided, taking care not injure the lung. Once the chest is entered, a curved Mayo scissors (or sterile trauma shears) is placed into the wound and pushed anteriorly toward the sternum to open the interspace by shearing the intercostal muscles from the rib (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86029 \">figure 4</a>). To complete the incision, the scissors are pushed to the posterior axillary line. Some surgeons prefer to disrupt the intercostal muscles with a sweeping motion by placing one or two fingers of each hand into the initial defect. </p><p>After entering the chest, a rib spreader (Finochietto) is inserted between the ribs with the arm of the retractor directed towards the left axilla, permitting extension of the incision across the sternum for additional exposure, if necessary, without the need to replace the retractor. The retractor should be opened as wide as possible to maximize exposure. To avoid rib fracture, some surgeons intentionally divide one of the ribs near the posterior attachment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108028383\"><span class=\"h2\">Damage control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the chest is opened, the anesthesiologist may reduce ventilation to the left lung by intentionally intubating the right main-stem bronchus. The surgeon can facilitate this by manually occluding the left mainstem bronchus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Any obvious bleeding source should be controlled with direct pressure initially. Bleeding that will hinder pericardiotomy or aortic cross-clamping needs to be managed first. Bleeding from noncardiac sites can be controlled using a combination of direct pressure using laparotomy pads or sponge sticks. Even for experienced trauma surgeons, blind use of clamps to control bleeding can be hazardous and should only be utilized as a last resort. Significant hemorrhage originating from the pulmonary parenchyma or major pulmonary vasculature can be controlled with direct clamping of the injured lung tissue (Duval clamp) or vessel, clamping the pulmonary hilum, or by using the &quot;pulmonary hilar twist&quot; maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86030\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86030 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Pulmonary hilar clamping and the &quot;pulmonary hilar twist&quot; also reduce the potential for ongoing air embolism. </p><p>To perform hilar clamping or the &quot;pulmonary hilar twist,&quot; the injured lung hilum is mobilized by dividing the inferior pulmonary ligament to the level of the inferior pulmonary vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86030\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86030 \">figure 6</a>). The hilum of the lung can be controlled with a large vascular clamp (eg, Crawford or Satinsky) or using a Rommel tourniquet and snares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. For the pulmonary twist maneuver, the lower lobe is rotated anteriorly over the upper lobe twisting the lung clockwise 180&deg;, which compresses the main pulmonary artery and vein against the bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It should be noted that the pulmonary hilar twist can result in significant irreversible injury to the lung and great vessels, and should be a maneuver of last resort. Care should be taken not to extend or create new injuries by over-twisting. To prevent the lung from untwisting, laparotomy packs are placed at the base and apex of the lung. </p><p>Prolonged hilar control (clamp or twist) can lead to complications such as right heart failure, dysrhythmias, and hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. As such, the duration of time the hilum is clamped or twisted should be limited, and pulmonary injuries identified and definitively managed as soon as is feasible. For some patients, the ongoing resuscitative effort is prolonged due to hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis. In these patients, prolonged hilar control commits the patient to pneumonectomy. The hilum should remain clamped or twisted until pulmonary resection can be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108022308\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardiotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step in a resuscitative thoracotomy is pericardiotomy. If there is no pericardial tamponade and other obvious non-cardiac injuries are apparent, it is acceptable to leave the pericardium intact to address these injuries first. Open cardiac massage can be performed with the pericardium intact. </p><p>If there are no other obvious injuries and the myocardium cannot be seen through the pericardium, the pericardium should be opened. The phrenic nerve is identified on the anterolateral surface of the pericardium and protected from injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86031\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86031 \">figure 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1247118564\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic anatomy'</a> above.) </p><p>The pericardium is grasped with a toothed forceps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62808\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62808 \">picture 2</a>) and the pericardial sac entered through a small incision anterior to the phrenic nerve using a knife or Metzenbaum scissors. The pericardiotomy is extended parallel <span class=\"nowrap\">(cranial/caudal)</span> to the phrenic nerve from the initial incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86031\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86031 \">figure 7</a>) using a Metzenbaum scissors to expose the heart and great vessels. Pericardial fluid and any blood clots are evacuated, and the heart and great vessels are inspected. The heart is then delivered from the pericardial sac, inspected on its surface for any wounds, and gently palpated. Any bleeding is controlled initially with digital compression. (See <a href=\"#H1247118637\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage control and repair'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1247118616\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic cross-clamping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thoracic aorta is typically cross-clamped to redistribute the available intravascular blood volume to the myocardium and brain, which effectively doubles the mean arterial pressure and cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/1,11,12,37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12,37-41</a>]. For patients with concomitant abdominal injuries, this maneuver also reduces subdiaphragmatic blood loss. </p><p>To perform aortic cross clamping, the left lung is retracted superiorly, and the inferior pulmonary ligament is divided. The orogastric or nasogastric tube should be palpated to differentiate the esophagus from the empty descending aorta. Dissection should be performed at the level of an inter-vertebral space in a plane perpendicular to the aorta to avoid injury to intercostals vessels, which branch from the aorta at the level of the mid-vertebral body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86032 \">figure 8</a>). The parietal pleura overlying the aorta are incised, and the tissues between the aorta and esophagus, as well as the prevertebral fascia, are separated to create sufficient space to place the aortic clamp without avulsing the intercostal arteries from the posterior surface of the aorta.</p><p>The aorta is ideally clamped just above the diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50029\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50029 \">picture 3</a>) to maximize spinal cord perfusion, but the aorta can also be clamped just below the left pulmonary hilum.<strong> </strong>For patients with abdominal injuries who survive the initial emergency department resuscitative efforts, the thoracic aortic cross-clamp should be repositioned lower on the abdominal aorta whenever possible. Prolonged clamping more than 30 minutes proximal to the visceral vessels should be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H108749231\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Aortic control'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1247118630\"><span class=\"h2\">Open cardiac massage and internal defibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the pericardium has been opened, Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols are continued with open cardiac massage and internal defibrillation, as needed. </p><p>Cardiac massage should be started immediately after placement of the thoracic aortic clamp and should only be delivered with a two-hand (&quot;clapping&quot;) technique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86033\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86033 \">figure 9</a>). The wrists of the caregiver are placed together at the apex of the heart, and the heart is squeezed together between the two open palms in a rhythmic motion. The thumb of each hand is maintained adjacent the first finger to avoid inadvertent digital penetration into the heart. The pulmonary outflow tract is particularly vulnerable to accidental puncture with the thumb. </p><p>Open cardiac massage is superior to closed chest compressions in maintaining cardiac output and providing cerebral and coronary perfusion in animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. External compressions provide approximately 25 percent of baseline cardiac output, resulting in only 10 percent of normal cerebral and coronary flow, whereas open cardiac massage generates 60 to 70 percent of baseline cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/43,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,46</a>]. In a small study of 10 patients who all underwent closed chest compressions followed by open chest cardiac massage, coronary perfusion pressures were 400 percent greater with open cardiac massage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>For patients in ventricular fibrillation, internal cardiac defibrillation is performed with the defibrillator initially set at 10 joules. Repeat defibrillation is performed, as needed, at 10 to 50 joules. One of the internal paddles is placed on the anterior (ventral) surface of the heart and the other is placed on the posterior (dorsal) surface of the heart. As with external defibrillation, all personnel should be well away from the patient prior to defibrillation to prevent inadvertent electric shock and avoid blood splatter. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1247118637\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhage control and repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding is controlled in a systematic fashion first by identifying and controlling bleeding from the heart, followed by controlling bleeding from major vascular structures of the chest and lungs. The extent to which temporizing repair can be performed during resuscitative thoracotomy depends upon the experience of the operator.</p><p>Patients who are most likely to be saved with a resuscitative thoracotomy are those with stab wounds to the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. If blood comes jetting out of the heart with pericardiotomy, the first maneuver is direct digital pressure on the cardiac defect. Small wounds may be amenable to definitive suture repair in the emergency department by appropriately trained personnel, but it is more common for temporizing measures to be instituted in the emergency department until definitive repair can be undertaken in the operating room where adequate lighting, proper instrumentation and materials, and appropriate nursing and support staff are available. </p><p>Temporizing maneuvers may include direct digital pressure on the wound while the patient is transported to the operating room, stapling the cardiac wound closed using a skin stapler with care to avoid the coronary arteries, or suturing the cardiac wound closed. Suture repair of ventricular cardiac injuries is accomplished using double-armed polypropylene (eg, Prolene), preferably on a cardiovascular (CV) needle. Interrupted 3-0 sutures are placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with pledgets. The suture is passed into the cardiac tissue on each side of the hole parallel to the finger that is providing vascular control (z-stitch), and the pledgets are seated onto the tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86034 \">figure 10</a>). As the finger is carefully withdrawn, an assistant gently pulls up on the suture, crossing the ends. Additional sutures are placed, as needed, prior to tying the sutures. Venous and atrial wounds can be repaired in a simple, running fashion using 3-0 or 4-0 sutures. </p><p>If larger defects are present and prove difficult to control or repair, balloon occlusion can be used to achieve temporary hemostasis. A clamped bladder catheter (5 cc balloon) can be inserted through the cardiac defect, inflated and then withdrawn to allow the balloon to tamponade the bleeding.</p><p>Following evaluation and management of any cardiac injuries, attention should be directed toward any remaining bleeding sites in the chest cavity that have not already been temporarily controlled using damage control techniques. In penetrating trauma, missile or implement trajectories are followed looking for great vessel, lung parenchyma, chest wall, and diaphragmatic injuries. As discussed above, vascular and pulmonary injuries can be clamped or direct pressure applied to control bleeding. Laparotomy pads that have controlled bleeding should remain in place until definitive repair can be undertaken in the operating room under optimal circumstances.

The detailed management of specific injuries is beyond the scope of this topic but can be found in separate topic reviews. Given the need for this level of expertise, we do <strong>not</strong> advocate undertaking resuscitative thoracotomy in any emergency department where definitive injury management is not immediately available. (See <a href=\"#H197313272\" class=\"local\">'Indications for thoracotomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Once thoracic, abdominal or other injuries have been adequately addressed in the operating room, the question remains whether to close the chest or to perform temporary closure, as is often performed following damage control laparotomy for trauma. Retrospective reviews have evaluated temporary thoracic closure but have not demonstrated any specific advantage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. In one small study, initial postoperative peak inspiratory pressures were significantly better with temporary closure compared with definitive closure (20 versus 32.5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. There were no significant differences in the incidence of infectious complications (24 versus 25 percent), hemorrhagic complications (18 versus 14 percent), or survival (47 versus 57 percent) between the two groups.</p><p>Patients who survive the initial operation are transferred to the intensive care unit for ongoing resuscitation to correct acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536270528\"><span class=\"h1\">MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available data evaluating the outcomes of resuscitative thoracotomy are derived primarily from retrospective reviews and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/2,7,8,15,25,55-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8,15,25,55-67</a>]. Studies are generally of low quality with heterogeneity in the populations and outcomes studied. A systematic review of 24 nonrandomized studies identified 4620 resuscitative thoracotomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The overall survival rate was 7.4 percent, ranging from 2.5 to 27.5 percent. The most significant factors associated with survival included mechanism of injury, magnitude and location of the injury, and the presence of signs of life. In a later review that included 10,238 patients who underwent resuscitative thoracotomy, 8.5 percent survived to discharge; 86 percent of survivors were neurologically intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Mechanism of injury is an important factor determining survival following resuscitative thoracotomy. Reported survival following resuscitative thoracotomy for isolated penetrating trauma is up to 70 percent, whereas survival following resuscitative thoracotomy for blunt trauma is rare. In a meta-analysis performed by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma, which included 7035 patients with emergency department thoracotomy (EDT), the overall survival rate was 7.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Stratified by mechanism of injury, patients with penetrating injuries had a survival rate of 11.2 percent, compared with 1.6 percent in those with blunt trauma. Among penetrating injuries, survival following resuscitative thoracotomy for stab wounds is two to four times higher than for gunshot wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/25,48,49,60,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,48,49,60,69,70</a>]. </p><p>The location and magnitude of the injuries also plays an important role in determining survival. One study found the highest survival rates for isolated penetrating cardiac injuries (19 percent), followed by penetrating non-cardiac thoracic (11 percent), penetrating abdominal (4 percent), and multiple penetrating injuries (less than 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients with blunt injuries had a survival rate of 1.4 percent. Overall survival for thoracic injuries was 10.7 percent compared with 4.5 percent for abdominal injuries, and much less for multiple injuries at 0.7 percent.</p><p>Survival is also closely related to the duration of CPR prior to thoracotomy. Survival is extremely rare if CPR exceeds 15 minutes. Survival is rare in the absence of witnessed vital signs at the scene or in the Emergency Department (ED). The absence of signs of life, which refers to lack of any evidence of cardiac and cerebral perfusion, is associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/61,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,71</a>]. In one retrospective review, nonreactive pupils were associated with no survival compared with a survival rate of 30 percent for those with reactive pupils. Similarly, one-third of patients with documented spontaneous extremity movement prior to arrival at the hospital survived, whereas none without extremity movement survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Patients with documented vital signs (blood pressure, pulse) in the field but who arrive to the emergency department in cardiac arrest also have higher survival rates (12 to 19 percent) compared with those without vital signs (0 to 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/3,25,62-64,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25,62-64,72</a>]. In a systematic review involving 10,238 patients who underwent resuscitative thoracotomy in the emergency department, patients presenting pulseless after penetrating thoracic injury had the most favorable outcomes both with and without signs of life (with, <span class=\"nowrap\">survival/neurologically</span> intact: 21.<span class=\"nowrap\">3/11</span>.7 percent; without, <span class=\"nowrap\">survival/neurologically</span> intact: 8.<span class=\"nowrap\">3/3</span>.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For patients presenting pulseless after penetrating extrathoracic injury, outcomes were more favorable with signs of life compared to without (with, <span class=\"nowrap\">survival/neurologically</span> intact 15.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/16</span>.5 percent; without, <span class=\"nowrap\">survival/neurologically</span> intact 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/5</span>.0 percent). Outcomes after pulseless blunt injury patients were poor. Survival following blunt trauma without neurological deficit is rare if CPR exceeds 10 minutes. A prior review of resuscitative thoracotomy after blunt trauma identified only two survivors from more than 500 patients without signs of life at the scene, and both had severe neurological deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The survival without neurological deficit if vital signs were lost during transit was 1.8 percent, and if vital signs were present in the ED, 4.5 percent. </p><p>One retrospective review of 102 patients undergoing thoracotomy over a 25-year period identified an overall survival rate of 7.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The patient population was stratified by the Lorenz Physiologic Status Classification based upon vital signs and signs of life as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class I &ndash; No signs of life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class II &ndash; Agonal (ie, pulseless electrical activity, no blood pressure)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class III &ndash; Profound shock (ie, BP &lt;60 mmHg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class IV &ndash; Mild shock (ie, 60 &lt;BP &lt;90 mmHg)</p><p/><p>Survival rates improved significantly with higher physiologic status.

Although CPR in the field portends a poor prognosis, CPR in the presence of cardiac tamponade has a more favorable outcome, particularly among patients with stab wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. For patients with blunt trauma, CPR in the field is associated with no meaningful survival; any survivors are not likely to be neurologically intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/56,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,74</a>].

In a study that examined the clinical condition of the patient upon arrival, neurologically intact survival following resuscitative thoracotomy occurred in fewer than 5 percent of those who arrived to the emergency department in shock, was 1 percent for those without vital signs, and 0 percent for those without signs of life in the field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>A single-center report from an urban Level I trauma center identified 37 survivors from 448 ED thoracotomies. The report suggests that despite the need for prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation, many survivors of EDT can expect to return to normal functional lives. The average length of stay was 43&plusmn;41 days, and one-third of patients required extended treatment in a rehabilitation hospital or skilled nursing facility. Multidisciplinary outpatient assessment after a median of 59 months following resuscitative thoracotomy showed that 75 percent had normal cognition and returned to normal activities, 81 percent were freely mobile and functional, and 75 percent had no evidence of posttraumatic stress disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108020054\"><span class=\"h1\">COST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resuscitative thoracotomy is expensive in terms of human resources, use of blood products, and potential consequences of the blood exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique/abstract/56,77-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,77-81</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1247118515\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H197313272\" class=\"local\">'Indications for thoracotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the decision has been made to open the chest, one member of the trauma team should be designated to lead the ongoing resuscitation effort while the senior member of the trauma team is performing the thoracotomy. Given the potential for blood splatter and the prevalence of blood-borne disease in the trauma population, all personnel involved in the care of the trauma patient should observe universal precautions wearing gowns, gloves, and eye protection at all times. (See <a href=\"#H1247118578\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resuscitative thoracotomy is performed through an anterolateral incision in the 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> intercostal space in a systematic manner. Given the indications for resuscitative thoracotomy (ie, patient in extremis with loss of vital signs), the steps are generally performed in a defined order; however, the clinical presentation of the patient or the nature of specific injuries may make one step take precedence over another. The typical approach is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The incision is made, the chest is entered, and a retractor is placed. (See <a href=\"#H108020288\" class=\"local\">'Incision'</a> above and <a href=\"#H108022140\" class=\"local\">'Opening the chest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Damage control maneuvers are used to manage hemorrhage that will impede performance of pericardiotomy or aortic cross-clamping.

Signs of air embolism are identified and treated. (See <a href=\"#H108022308\" class=\"local\">'Pericardiotomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1247118637\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage control and repair'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1247118651\" class=\"local\">'Identifying and evacuating air embolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The aorta is cross-clamped, which facilitates filling of the heart and ongoing fluid resuscitation.

Survival also depends upon the clinical status of the patient prior to arrival in the emergency department, approaching zero percent for those who do not have signs of life or vital signs in the field. Of those who survive, permanent neurologic deficits occur in 7 to 18 percent of patients.
