On the other hand, sperm production can usually be stimulated to a level sufficient to restore fertility in men who are infertile as a result of secondary hypogonadism, ie, due to damage to the pituitary or hypothalamus. Men who have pituitary disease can be treated with gonadotropins, while those with hypothalamic disease can be treated with gonadotropins or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).

We recommend treatment with gonadotropins for most men who have secondary hypogonadism due to either hypothalamic or pituitary disease who wish to become fertile (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>). Gonadotropin treatment will not increase the sperm count in men who have idiopathic oligospermia, in which a subnormal sperm count is associated with a normal serum testosterone concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Several factors enhance the likelihood that the sperm count will be increased and increased sooner after gonadotropin administration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of hypogonadism after puberty rather than before. In one study, as an example, all six men whose hypogonadism occurred postpubertally experienced an increase in total sperm count from less than one million to above 40 million per ejaculate when treated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (see <a href=\"#H406186283\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment: hCG'</a> below).

Some have suggested that prior treatment of men who have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with testosterone will impair the spermatogenic response to subsequent gonadotropin treatment, but a 2014 meta-analysis did not confirm this suggestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>Gonadotropin treatment of men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism results in the appearance of sperm in the ejaculate in up to 90 percent of these men, but often not to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

This disorder should, in theory, respond to the administration of LH and FSH. In practice, testosterone secretion virtually always increases to normal after replacement of LH, and sperm production more often than not increases after replacement of LH alone or LH plus FSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F105067\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105067 \">algorithm 1</a>).

There is no theoretical reason to use recombinant human LH, since it has a shorter half-life (10 hours) than hCG and therefore would probably not be effective given three times a week. Recombinant hCG is used as an ovulatory trigger for ovulation induction but has no advantage for stimulation of spermatogenesis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406186289\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing and regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After stopping testosterone therapy, hCG is administered according to the following regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F105067\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105067 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are taught to self-administer hCG. We use hCG given intramuscularly in the thigh at an initial dose of 2000 units three times a week, always on the same three days (eg, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays). The vial of hCG contains 10,000 units of hCG powder; dissolving the powder with 5 mL (of the 10 mL provided) yields 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. The patient is instructed to inject 1 mL. Although urinary hCG is not approved for subcutaneous administration by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), many clinicians prefer this route because it is easier and better tolerated by patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects of hCG therapy are few and generally similar to those of testosterone.

Some patients require as much as 10,000 units per dose. On rare occasions, the serum testosterone concentration fails to respond to hCG, even to 10,000 units three times a week. This problem is thought to be due to antibodies to hCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Men with a history of cryptorchidism also often have a poor response. Gonadotropin therapy will therefore not be successful in these patients, and they may wish to consider in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor semen or adoption.</p><p>Less often, the serum testosterone will be higher than normal in response to the initial dose of 2000 units three times a week, so the dose is decreased by dissolving the powder in larger volumes (eg 6, 7, 8, 9, or even 10 mL) of diluent.</p><p>The sperm count is measured every one to three months once the serum testosterone concentration is 400 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL,</span> but the value is not used to adjust the hCG dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F105067\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105067 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Although most patients have a normal sperm count, or at least in the 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">million/mL</span> range by six months, others require 12 to 24 months (if only hCG is used) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As mentioned above, men with a prepubertal onset of hypogonadism are unlikely to respond to hCG alone, particularly if the hypogonadism is accompanied by cryptorchidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54583\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54583 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The effect of FSH is probably exerted via the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules. FSH appears to be necessary for the initiation of spermatogenesis, but not for its maintenance or reinitiation.</p><p>Once the serum testosterone concentration has been maintained within the normal range for several months yet the sperm count has not reached at least half-normal, the following regimen is used to add hMG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F105067\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105067 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial dose is 75 units (the contents of one vial) three times a week; it is most conveniently administered in the same syringe as hCG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sperm count is measured once every one to three months. The reason for such frequent measurement of the sperm count is that individual values fluctuate considerably, so that many samples are needed to detect a trend.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hMG dose can be increased to 150 units if the sperm count does not reach 5 to 10 million per ejaculate within six months. This will increase the serum FSH concentration from low-normal to high-normal, but it is less certain that it will increase the sperm count. As long as the sperm count is at least a few million, however, continuation of hCG and hMG administration is probably worthwhile because even values this low can result in impregnation spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The time to achieve the first sperm in the ejaculate and the maximum amount varies considerably from patient to patient, partly due to the degree of hypogonadism, history of cryptorchidism, and prior testosterone or gonadotropin treatment, as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343023623\"><span class=\"h3\">Recombinant human FSH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (rhFSH) was developed for use in ovulation induction to avoid the small amount of LH present in hMG preparations. Although there is no advantage for such purity of FSH in stimulation of spermatogenesis, rhFSH has been tested in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and is commercially available. One report describes 100 men with severe hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, as indicated by azoospermia in all and baseline serum testosterone concentrations &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> and testicular volume &lt;7 mL in most of them, but no history of cryptorchidism. Following hCG pretreatment for three to six months, the addition of rhFSH to hCG (in doses from 150 to 300 units subcutaneously every other day for 18 months) increased the sperm density to &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">million/mL</span> in 46.2 to 88.9 percent of them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>rhFSH has not been compared directly with hMG in men, but its efficacy when added to hCG in stimulating spermatogenesis in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism seems similar.

This therapy is limited by the need for a subcutaneous infusion pump, as well as its cost and limited availability. GnRH is currently unavailable in the United States but is used in some specialized centers in other countries.</p><p>The rationale for pulsatile GnRH is that replacement of GnRH in a physiologic manner, in pulses every two hours, will stimulate the gonadotroph cells of the pituitary to secrete LH and FSH, which in turn will stimulate the testes to produce testosterone and sperm.

We suggest not using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate in these patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1034859258\" class=\"local\">'Clomiphene citrate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gonadotropins are more convenient to administer than pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and GnRH is not widely available. In the United States, it is available only on an experimental basis. (See <a href=\"#H1034859238\" class=\"local\">'Role of pulsatile GnRH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration alone does not increase the sperm count to at least 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">million/mL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if pregnancy has not occurred six months after serum testosterone is 400 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (13.87 to 27.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> we suggest adding human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), a preparation used for its follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F105067\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105067 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
