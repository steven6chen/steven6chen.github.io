Transplant evaluation in these patients requires a careful work-up to identify the underlying disease, as post-transplant care may need to be modified. Additionally, for infiltrative disorders, the involvement of other organs needs to be assessed.

Patients with hemochromatosis may require combined heart and liver transplant. The infiltrative cardiomyopathy that has generated the most interest in the last few years has been amyloidosis. With amyloid, it is imperative to identify the etiology as either being due to light chain AL amyloid or a transthyretin genetic mutation (TTR).

Many programs have routinely excluded patients over the age of 60 to 65, but most feel that physiologic age is more important than chronologic age. Some centers will perform transplants up to age 70 years with the older patients required to meet additional selection criteria such as less than two prior open heart procedures, preserved renal function, no prior cerebrovascular events, and preserved hepatic function. </p><p>A report based on United Network of Organ Sharing data for 14,401 first-time transplant recipients between 1999 and 2006 demonstrated that patients &ge;60 years of age more frequently had comorbidities than younger patients and that their overall survival post-transplant was lower than in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, cumulative five-year survival for patients &ge;60 years of age was only slightly lower than that for younger patients (69 versus 75 percent). Multivariate analysis revealed recipient age &ge;60 years, donor age, ischemic time, creatinine, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus to be independent predictors of mortality.</p><p>Carefully selected patients over 60 years of age have a survival rate comparable to that in younger patients. This was illustrated in a report that compared 63 patients transplanted at 65 years of age or older (mean age 67) with 63 matched younger patients (mean age 48) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Survival was comparable for both groups at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years; there was also no significant difference in the incidence of rejection or infection. As a result of such findings, most centers now focus on the patient's &quot;physiologic&quot; age, with emphasis on the functional integrity of major organ systems and the absence of exclusionary comorbid diseases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1963075079\"><span class=\"h4\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since body mass index (BMI) &gt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> is associated with worse outcomes after cardiac transplantation, we suggest recommending weight loss to a BMI &le;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> prior to listing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1730497463\"><span class=\"h4\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes mellitus with evidence of significant end-organ damage (eg, neuropathy or nephropathy, but not nonproliferative retinopathy) is a relative contraindication to heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The concern in this setting is the superimposed nephrotoxicity of long-term calcineurin inhibitor therapy.

Malignancy can be worsened by the immunosuppressive therapy given to prevent transplant rejection. Even without pre-existing disease, the incidence of malignancy (eg, skin cancers, lymphoproliferative disorders, and some solid tumors such as thyroid or cervical cancers) is increased following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>As noted above, an absolute contraindication to transplantation is a condition expected to limit life expectancy to &lt;2 years despite cardiac transplantation; this includes some malignancies with poor prognosis. </p><p>Other neoplasms that are not immediately life-limiting may present only a relative contraindication. Cardiac transplantation is an option for patients with low risk of tumor recurrence based upon the tumor type, response to therapy, negative metastatic work-up, and passage of an individualized period of remission (ie, no arbitrary time period for observation in remission) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, patients with past history of malignancy now considered cured who have a cardiomyopathy as a consequence of chemotherapy given for the malignancy are considered reasonable candidates for transplantation.

One concern is that active infection can become fulminant in the setting of introducing immunosuppressive therapy. However, with the increasing use of mechanical device support as a bridge to transplant, it has become accepted practice in some centers to proceed with cardiac transplantation in patients with ongoing controlled device infections; transplantation enables removal of the device, which is essential to eradicate the infection.

This is probably an underestimate, as reporting to the registry is voluntary outside of the United States. In the United States, where reporting to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has been mandatory for the past two decades, the number of United States heart transplants performed has been stable at around 2300 annually (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F107831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107831 \">figure 3</a>).

This system delineates prioritization rules that take into account the clinical severity of illness, time accrued on the wait list, blood type compatibility, and geographic distance. With heart procurement, the duration of ischemic time for the donor heart is a limiting factor in organ retrieval, with ischemic times greater than four hours associated with a higher rate of primary graft failure. Accordingly, geographic distance between the donor hospital and the transplant center is measured in 500 nautical mile circular concentric zones. &#160;</p><p>This allocation system is regularly reviewed and revised with input from various sectors, including transplant professionals, organ recipients, and donor families. The current allocation system is shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83792 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The last major change to this allocation system occurred in July 2006 when Status 1A and 1B patients in Zone A (first 500 mile concentric circle) were prioritized over local Status 2 candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Despite efforts to develop equal sharing of a scarce resource, there continues to be great variability in the median time to transplant that is highly dependent on location, ie, UNOS regions.

In the past, the sensitized candidate was typically a multiparous woman or a person with some prior transfusions. However, with the emergence of mechanical assist devices, the incidence of allosensitization has risen due to the multiple transfusions frequently required (at the time of implant or during long-term follow-up) by patients receiving these devices. The need for multi-drug high-dose anticoagulation and the development of acquired von Willebrand disease frequently results in blood loss requiring transfusion during the time patients are bridged to transplant with these devices.
