UC affects the colon and is characterized by inflammation of the mucosal layer. CD can involve any component of the gastrointestinal tract from the oral cavity to the anus and is characterized by transmural inflammation. These disorders have distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics, but their pathogenesis remains poorly understood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, epidemiology, and risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The peak incidence of IBD occurs in patients between the ages of 15 and 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of patients with CD and 12 percent of patients with UC develop their IBD before the age of 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Adults and children with IBD may present with similar clinical features; however, children can develop unique complications, including growth failure and delayed puberty. Thus, clinicians caring for children and adolescents with one of these disorders must treat the underlying disease and its complications and also must carefully monitor linear growth, skeletal development, and puberty. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Suspicion of IBD typically arises from a combination of symptoms and screening laboratory data. The diagnosis is established by radiographic studies and endoscopy, including biopsies. These studies also help to localize the disease and to differentiate between UC and CD.

Although growth failure is a common feature, a substantial number of children are overweight when they present with IBD (particularly those with UC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, obesity or lack of growth failure should not preclude a diagnosis of IBD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical findings &ndash; Abdominal tenderness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mass (especially in the right lower quadrant), perianal disease (fistulae, anal skin tags, or fissures), or occult blood in stool</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraintestinal manifestations &ndash; Oral ulcerations (aphthous stomatitis), clubbing, rash (erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum), eye inflammation (uveitis), jaundice or hepatomegaly, or arthritis (See <a href=\"#H1351752\" class=\"local\">'Extraintestinal manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms suggesting colitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colitis usually presents as a subacute illness characterized by diarrhea that almost always contains blood, fatigue, anemia, and sometimes weight loss. The onset of symptoms may be insidious, with diarrhea that is initially non-bloody, and sometimes poor weight gain. Some children have a more fulminant presentation, with severe abdominal pain, frankly bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, fever, leukocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia.</p><p>Colitis can occur in patients with either UC or CD. By definition, patients with UC have colitis that affects the rectum and extends proximally to a variable degree. CD also may involve the colon, either exclusively (Crohn's colitis), or in combination with small intestinal involvement (Crohn's ileocolitis). Patients with either CD or UC may also exhibit gastritis or duodenitis at the time of diagnosis. Individuals with IBD presenting at a young age are particularly likely to present with symptoms of colitis: 10 to 15 percent of children and adolescents with IBD present prior to six years of age, and the majority of these children have isolated colonic disease (either UC or Crohn's colitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. CD tends to present in late childhood or adolescence, and is the predominant form of IBD after eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other gastrointestinal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients, particularly those with CD, present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms that may be difficult to distinguish from more common conditions such as functional abdominal pain. The most useful indicators of possible IBD in a child with abdominal pain are: diarrhea, growth failure, pubertal delay, weight loss, rectal bleeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">pallor/fatigue,</span> perianal skin tags (which may be misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids), perianal fistulae or abscesses, a palpable abdominal mass, and a family history of IBD. The abdominal pain associated with CD is often focal and located in the right lower quadrant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11172431\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth failure or delay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth failure or growth delay is common at presentation, particularly in children with CD. The earliest and most subtle form of growth failure is a decrease in height velocity; this may progress to short stature for age, delayed bone age, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pubertal delay. Up to 50 percent of patients with CD have a decrease in height velocity before the onset of any other intestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

These may involve the mouth, skin, joints, liver, eye, and (rarely) other organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81867%7EPEDS%2F88092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81867 graphicRef88092 \">table 1A-B</a>). These disorders appear idiosyncratically in some patients and not others, but are more often associated with colonic disease (ie, Crohn's colitis or UC). Certain extraintestinal manifestations are more common in CD compared with UC, including oral aphthae (superficial ulcerations, also known as aphthous stomatitis), erythema nodosum, digital clubbing, and arthritis. They do not consistently correlate with the degree of intestinal inflammation. Occasionally, patients present with extraintestinal symptoms (such as aphthous stomatitis, arthritis, or liver disease) before any obvious gastrointestinal symptoms develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral cavity </strong>&ndash; Aphthous stomatitis (superficial ulcerations) of the mouth occurs in about 10 percent of children with IBD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56573\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56573 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54825 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>], and is about three times more common among those with CD compared with UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Associated findings may include labial, intraoral or gingival swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58499\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58499 \">picture 3</a>), cobblestoning of the oral mucosa, and tag-like mucosal lesions.

It is a presenting feature in about 5 percent of children with IBD and typically resolves rapidly when therapy of the IBD is instituted; it is seen more often in patients with CD than UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/10,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13</a>]. Erythema nodosum also may be caused by disorders other than IBD, including infections (eg, Group A Streptococcus, tuberculosis), medications (eg, penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>), autoimmune disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus), and malignancy.

However, it has been described in an infant with CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

However, its consequences often are more severe. The uveitis is frequently bilateral, posterior to the lens, insidious in onset, chronic in duration, and is more common in females than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. &quot;Iritis&quot; is an alternate term for anterior uveitis.

The arthritis typically is nonerosive and asymmetric, affects large joints, including the hips, knees, and wrists, and parallels the activity of the intestinal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. In contrast, axial skeletal involvement, in the form of ankylosing spondylitis and sacroiliac joint arthritis, may follow an independent course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Individuals with CD have an increased risk for cholelithiasis, but this is uncommon in UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Patients with IBD also have an increased risk for autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatobiliary manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most serious liver disease associated with IBD is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a condition causing inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, which may lead to complicated hepatobiliary disease, including cholangitis, hepatic cirrhosis, and liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. PSC occurs in 2 to 10 percent of patients with UC, and a smaller proportion of patients with Crohn colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/11,28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28,30</a>]. Patients with PSC may present with fatigue, pruritus, and intermittent jaundice; the severity of the PSC is not correlated with the colitis disease activity. Patients with IBD should undergo laboratory screening for hepatobiliary disease at diagnosis and periodically thereafter. PSC is characterized by an elevation of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), alkaline phosphatase, and a less pronounced elevation of ALT and AST. The diagnosis of PSC is made by a combination of radiographic imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and liver biopsy. Some affected patients have concurrent clinical, biochemical and histologic findings of autoimmune hepatitis in addition to cholangiographic findings consistent with PSC; this combination of features is known as PSC-autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

However, no therapy has been shown to alter the natural history of the disease, and there is some evidence that high-dose treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid may be detrimental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In an observational study, about 20 percent of patients with IBD and PSC developed cirrhosis, and 2 percent required liver transplantation, at median follow up 3.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These outcomes were somewhat better than for children with PSC that was not associated with IBD; it is possible that this is because PSC was identified earlier in patients with IBD, due to routine screening for liver disease. PSC is associated with a substantial risk for hepatobiliary cancer. In addition, individuals with UC and PSC also appear to be at higher risk for developing colorectal cancer compared with patients with UC alone, so early and frequent surveillance colonoscopy is recommended for this group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Venous thromboembolism</strong> &ndash; Active IBD is associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism, which occurs in 1 to 2 percent of hospitalized patients, including pulmonary embolism and cerebrovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Factors that further increase the risk for thromboembolism include the presence of a central venous catheter, severe disease activity, older age, parenteral nutrition, oral contraceptives, and an underlying inherited thrombophilia. For patients who develop thromboembolism, anticoagulation (eg, low molecular weight heparin) is feasible and appropriate, even in the context of gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Guidelines have not been established for <strong>prevention</strong> of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with IBD. Primary prophylaxis is generally recommended for adult IBD patients with severe disease activity and additional risk factors for thromboembolism, such as a central venous catheter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a strong family history of thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. For pediatric patients, the risk of primary venous thromboembolism is probably somewhat lower than in adults, but the consequences of thromboembolism can be serious. Prophylactic anticoagulation usually should be given to any hospitalized child with severe IBD activity and a prior history of thromboembolism. Moreover, prophylaxis should be seriously considered for older children with severe IBD activity and other risk factors, including the presence of a central venous line, a family history of thromboembolism, or immobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, non-pharmacologic interventions to minimize thromboembolism should be used for all hospitalized children with IBD, including adequate hydration, mobilization, and the use of compression stockings or pneumatic devices if appropriate.

However, estimates vary depending on disease type (CD versus UC), disease severity, and on the cutoff value used to define abnormal ESR or CRP. There are no widely accepted cutoff values for ESR and CRP for identifying patients at risk for IBD, and the normal range for CRP varies among laboratories. In studies evaluating the predictive value of these inflammatory markers, an ESR &gt;20 or &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hr,</span> and CRP &gt;5 or &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].

As an example, among children evaluated at a referral center for IBD, CRP was elevated in 100 percent of those with CD and 60 percent of those with UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Patients with more severe disease were more likely to have abnormal values on these laboratory tests, particularly the ESR. Thus, endoscopic and radiographic evaluation is sometimes appropriate in some patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of IBD, even if initial blood tests are normal.

However, the test characteristics vary depending on the prevalence of IBD in the study population. In settings with a high prevalence of IBD, such as a gastroenterology clinic, elevated fecal calprotectin (eg, &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g)</span> is useful for identifying patients with a high likelihood of having IBD. One study from a referral center for pediatric gastroenterology found that fecal calprotectin had better performance characteristics for this purpose than ESR, CRP, or hypoalbuminemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. By contrast, in settings with a low prevalence of IBD, such as a primary care setting, fecal calprotectin is more useful to rule out IBD (ie, if fecal calprotectin is normal [eg, &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g],</span> then IBD is unlikely) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Compared with fecal calprotectin, fecal leukocytes have considerably lower specificity and sensitivity for detecting inflammatory diarrhea. Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin are also found in other causes of inflammatory diarrhea including bacterial and viral enteritis, intestinal lymphoma, celiac disease, food allergy, and immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], and also in the setting of juvenile polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Fecal lactoferrin also has been used as a marker for disease activity, but is less well-studied than fecal calprotectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].

Therefore, this test can be useful in monitoring response to treatment, but because of limited sensitivity and specificity it should be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests and symptoms to arrive at clinical decisions.

Infection with an enteric pathogen can mimic IBD. However, they can also trigger IBD, so the presence of an enteric pathogen does not exclude the possibility of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. If enteric pathogens are identified, they should be treated.

Therefore, patients who fail to respond to treatment, or those with symptoms of IBD other than bloody diarrhea, including growth failure, should also be fully evaluated with endoscopy and imaging. If colonoscopy is performed, histopathologic features that suggest chronicity support the diagnosis of IBD rather than an infectious colitis. (See <a href=\"#H9479602\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9480161\" class=\"local\">'Features of UC'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13111353\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonoscopy should be performed in patients with suspected IBD, even in the absence of clear lower gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloody diarrhea.

Many centers routinely perform upper endoscopy at the time of colonoscopy even in the absence of UGI symptoms, in an effort to help differentiate between UC and CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/44,57,60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,57,60-62</a>].

This approach improves patient comfort and increases the likelihood of a complete endoscopic examination.

This modality provides good visualization of the small bowel lumen, revealing strictures and fistulas, but does not generally detect ulcers or erosions. It exposes the patient to a moderate amount of radiation, but less radiation than a CT scan, particularly if pediatric dose-minimizing protocols are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) &ndash; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used for imaging of the small bowel and extraintestinal findings (eg, perianal fistula or abscess) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].

Active disease is characterized by diffuse and continuous edema, erythema, induced and spontaneous friability, and ulceration. The distal colon is usually more severely involved than more proximal aspects of the colon. In severe, relatively acute disease, extensive erosions and ulcerations may be present.

(See <a href=\"#H1351752\" class=\"local\">'Extraintestinal manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients presenting with rectal bleeding, laboratory testing should be performed to exclude other illnesses. If diarrhea or loose stools are present, stool cultures (in particular, <em>C. difficile</em>) should be performed to identify enteric pathogens. A vasculitic rash or arthralgia suggests the possibility of Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura. If stools are formed (ie, not diarrhea), other causes of rectal bleeding should be explored, including Meckel's diverticulum, polyps, and anal fissures. (See <a href=\"#H9479602\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the clinical presentation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> initial laboratory testing support the diagnosis of IBD, further evaluation should include both small bowel imaging and colonoscopy, (with biopsies taken from the terminal ileum, if possible). Biopsies from the terminal ileum and each segment of the colon should be sent for histopathologic examination. Upper endoscopy is also routinely performed at the time of the initial colonoscopy in many centers, and provides further information as to disease type and extent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77827 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Features diagnostic of CD include evidence of small bowel involvement on upper GI series with small bowel follow-through <span class=\"nowrap\">(UGI/SBFT)</span> or magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), noncaseating granulomas on histopathologic examination, or marked perianal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74564\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74564 \">table 4</a>). Antibody tests for P-ANCA, ASCA, and anti-OmpC are sometimes used to supplement the diagnostic evaluation, but do not reliably diagnose IBD or differentiate between the disease subtypes.

In addition to helping to classify the IBD into CD or UC subtypes, this information is often important in choosing types of therapy.
