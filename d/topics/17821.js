Therefore, it is important to establish true CRBSI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of CRBSI due to organisms of relatively low virulence that are difficult to eradicate (eg, <em>Bacillus</em> spp, <em>Micrococcus </em>spp, or <em>Cutibacterium </em>spp [formerly <em>Propionibacterium </em>spp]), removal of both short- and long-term catheters (including implantable catheters or infusion ports) is appropriate if blood culture contamination has been ruled out (eg, based on multiple positive culture results with at least one sample drawn from a peripheral vein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In addition, catheter removal is not necessary for hemodynamically stable patients with unexplained fever in the absence of documented bloodstream infection and without endovascular prosthetic material (such as a prosthetic valve, pacemaker, or vascular graft) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/3,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13-15</a>].</p><p>For non-implanted catheters, the subcutaneous segment and tip should be cultured by the roll plate method.

Catheter salvage in the setting of coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection does not influence resolution of bacteremia but may be a risk factor for recurrence (relative risk 6.6 in a retrospective series of 175 cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>If salvage is attempted, systemic therapy should be administered through the colonized catheter for the duration of therapy, with the possible addition of antimicrobial lock therapy. The efficacy of antibiotic lock therapy remains uncertain and concerns have been raised about the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and fungal superinfection. The optimal antimicrobial dosing for lock therapy is also uncertain. Antibiotic lock therapy is not warranted for management of catheter infection for devices in place for &lt;2 weeks; these are usually extraluminal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

However, most studies describing successful management of catheter infection via catheter exchange over a guidewire have been small, uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>].</p><p>The benefit of antimicrobial impregnated catheters is uncertain. Many trials of antiseptic or antimicrobial-impregnated central venous catheters have reported a decreased incidence of catheter-related infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. However, a randomized trial of 780 adult intensive care unit patients managed with chlorhexidine-coated or uncoated catheters failed to demonstrate a reduction in the rate of bloodstream infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Replacement of the catheter with an antimicrobial-impregnated catheter should be considered in settings where rates of CRBSIs exceed the National Healthcare Safety Network surveillance data threshold despite adherence to aseptic techniques (eg, &gt;1.1 infections per 1000 catheter days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The tip of the removed catheter should be sent for culture; if the results are positive or if there is evidence of phlebitis, thrombosis, or purulence, the newly inserted catheter should be relocated to a new site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, indications for catheter removal and choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy for children with CRBSI are similar to those for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In a prospective study of chronic venous access devices in over 1000 children with cancer, most episodes of CRBSI were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci followed by <em>S. aureus</em> (34 and 25 percent of cases, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Some pediatricians favor attempting treatment of bacterial CRBSI without catheter removal, given greater difficulty with vascular access among children than among adults. In such cases, both systemic and antimicrobial lock therapy may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic lock therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The benefits of catheter removal must be weighed against the difficulty of obtaining alternative venous access. Several studies have reported successful CRBSI management among children without catheter removal; close monitoring is required, and the device should be removed in the event of clinical deterioration or recurrence of CRBSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/30,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33,34</a>].</p><p>Catheter removal is always necessary in the setting of fungemia. Treatment of catheter-associated fungemia without catheter removal has a low success rate and is associated with high mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Issues related to management of central lines in neutropenic patients with candidemia are discussed separately.
