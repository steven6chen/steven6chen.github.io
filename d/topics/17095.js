In the United States, almost 2 million outpatient visits for a primary diagnosis of urolithiasis were recorded in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Up to 16 percent of men and 8 percent of women will have at least one symptomatic stone by the age of 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; over 80 percent of these stones will contain calcium, usually as calcium oxalate.</p><p>The prevalence of kidney stones appears to be increasing in the United States. In a report from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, the prevalence increased from 3.8 percent in the period 1976 to 1980 to 8.4 percent in the period from 2007 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Furthermore, the male-to-female ratio has changed over the past 25 years, from 3:1 (male:female) to now less than 2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. Whether this represents an actual increase in incidence or an increase in detection is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If true, some have speculated that it is due to changes in lifestyle factors, such as increasing obesity among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of nephrolithiasis varies regionally. In one study of over 40,000 men between the ages of 45 and 70 years, the risk of having a history of kidney stones was 13 and 31 percent lower in the mid-Atlantic and northwestern regions, respectively, compared with the southeastern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A second study confirmed this regional variation, but found that differences were greatly reduced after adjustment for temperature, sunlight, and beverage consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of nephrolithiasis increases with age, is slightly higher in men compared with women, and in whites compared with blacks, Asians, and those of Hispanic ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/1,3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,11,12</a>].

Therefore, the type and extent of evaluation depends in part upon the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity and type of stone disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether it is the first or a recurrent stone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence or absence of systemic disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> risk factors for recurrent stone formation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of nephrolithiasis (considered a significant risk factor for recurrent stone formation)</p><p/><p>A review of the evaluation of the <strong>first</strong> spontaneously passed kidney stone as well as asymptomatic nephrolithiasis will be presented here.

Several studies have examined the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones; as examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort of 110 patients with 160 asymptomatic kidney stones was followed with active surveillance (using renal ultrasound performed every 6 to 12 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. During a mean follow-up of 3.4 years, 28 percent of stones produced symptoms and 17 percent required surgery for these symptoms; an additional 3 percent caused silent obstruction that required intervention. Lower pole stones were less likely to cause symptoms or pass spontaneously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study monitored 107 such patients for a mean of 32 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The likelihood of developing symptoms was approximately 32 percent at 2.5 years and 49 percent at 5 years; the risk was lowest in patients who had no history of previous stones. Roughly one-half of symptomatic patients required a procedure (such as shockwave lithotripsy) for removal of the stone, while the remaining symptomatic patients passed the stone spontaneously. </p><p/><p>In addition to these findings, a number of studies have determined that patients with residual stones following shockwave lithotripsy or percutaneous stone removal are at increased risk for symptomatic stone episodes. However, these investigations also suggest that appropriate medical stone management can significantly reduce recurrent stone formation or growth of existing stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Thus, certain asymptomatic patients should undergo evaluation and treatment, based upon their occupation (airline pilots, frequent business travelers) or complexity (neurologic disease, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, such as urinary diversion or solitary kidney).</p><p>In summary, there is an appreciable risk of a stone becoming symptomatic with expectant therapy. There is, however, also morbidity associated with elective shockwave lithotripsy or other minimally invasive procedures to prophylactically remove the stone. Thus, specific factors, such as the stone size and location, as well as the patient's occupation (pilot, frequent traveler, local worker), will dictate how aggressively the clinician should manage existing renal calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Active surveillance is a reasonable approach in asymptomatic patients with small, non-infected calculi, without evidence of obstruction. Yet, in patients with intermittently symptomatic calculi or in those individuals &quot;at risk&quot; for stone episodes (solitary kidney, urinary tract reconstruction, immunosuppression, etc), minimally invasive stone removal (SWL, ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy) is warranted. A metabolic evaluation and appropriate medical therapy should still be considered, regardless of the decision concerning removal of the present stone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2037764734\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

This relatively indolent course and the availability of minimally invasive therapy for most symptomatic stones have led some to recommend a limited evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>However, patients who have passed only a single stone may have other stones remaining in the kidneys, and imaging studies (particularly a helical CT scan) must be carefully reviewed for additional stones, as such patients, by definition, are recurrent stone formers. In addition, first-time stone formers have the same underlying metabolic risk factors and severity of stone disease as recurrent stone formers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>conservative approach</strong> to the patient presenting with their first symptomatic kidney stone includes the following (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Conservative approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A focused history to assess dietary and behavioral habits that can contribute to stone disease and provoke future stone formation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Focused history for stone risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A urinalysis and culture, since a pH greater than 7.5 and positive urine culture are compatible with infection lithiasis, whereas a pH less than 5.5 favors uric acid lithiasis. The sediment may also be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Urinalysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Available stones should be analyzed to determine their crystalline composition. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Stone analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increasing fluid intake to produce at least two liters of urine per day, possibly including drinking at night, will increase the urine flow rate and lower the urine solute concentration, both of which protect against stone formation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Conservative approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subsequent monitoring with a KUB or ultrasonography for the detection of new stones. Monitoring should be performed initially at one year and, if negative, every two to four years thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Conservative approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>risk-based approach</strong> to the patient presenting with their first symptomatic stone varies according to the estimated risk for future nephrolithiasis. For low-risk patients, the conservative strategy mentioned above is used. However, for patients at moderate to high risk for future nephrolithiasis (eg, if the patient is obese or has diabetes, has a cystine, struvite, or uric acid stone, has a chronic diarrheal state or other predisposing medical condition, is black, or has a family history of stone disease), the following evaluation is suggested (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Approach based upon risk assessment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A serum chemistry panel to help identify certain disorders, such as primary hyperparathyroidism, hyperuricemia, and distal renal tubular acidosis, that are associated with nephrolithiasis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A non-contrast helical CT at 5 mm cuts, if not already performed, to search for residual stones within the urinary tract. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An assessment of urine composition with two 24-hour urine collections obtained in the outpatient setting, with the patient following their usual diet, fluid intake, and physical activity to identify metabolic abnormalities that could contribute to nephrolithiasis and to guide therapy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Urine stone risk profile'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrolithiasis is occasionally an incidental finding in patients who are asymptomatic. There is an appreciable risk that a previously asymptomatic stone will become symptomatic with expectant therapy (49 percent at five years in one study). Expectant therapy may be a reasonable approach in asymptomatic patients with small, non-infected calculi, without evidence of obstruction. However, certain asymptomatic patients, depending upon their occupation (airline pilots, frequent business travelers) or complexity (neurologic disease, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, such as urinary diversion or solitary kidney), should undergo evaluation and treatment to reduce the risk of recurrent stone formation or growth of existing stones. Prophylactic stone removal may also be considered in high-risk patients. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic nephrolithiasis'</a> above.) </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Scales CD Jr, Smith AC, Hanley JM, et al.
