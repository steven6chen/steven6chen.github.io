The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.</p><p>A small amount of acid reflux is normal. But if the reflux happens frequently, it can cause problems with the esophagus or lung infections (pneumonia). Reflux that has become more serious is called &quot;gastroesophageal reflux disease,&quot; or GERD.</p><p>Children with certain health issues have a higher risk of getting reflux. These include children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, or other problems with the brain or spinal cord. Children who are overweight also are more likely to have reflux.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2271539\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of acid reflux?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms depend on the child&rsquo;s age.</p><p>Preschool children with acid reflux might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taste stomach acid in the mouth, or feel it in the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not want to eat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight</p><p/><p>Older children or adolescents with acid reflux might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taste stomach acid in the mouth, or feel it in the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an upset stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel burning in the chest (known as &quot;heartburn&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble swallowing</p><p/><p>Having symptoms like these once in a while is normal. If any of these symptoms happen more than once a week, this might be a sign of GERD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2271546\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you think your child might have acid reflux, talk to his or her doctor or nurse before you try any treatments. He or she can suggest ways to help relieve symptoms. He or she might also do tests to figure out if your child's symptoms are caused by reflux or something else.</p><p>Take your child to see a doctor or nurse <strong>right away</strong> if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble swallowing, or feels as though food gets &quot;stuck&quot; on the way down</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loses weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chokes when he or she eats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomits blood</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2271553\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are some things that might help with acid reflux, depending on your child's age and symptoms. Your child's doctor or nurse might suggest that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid giving your child foods that make symptoms worse (examples include chocolate, peppermint, and fatty foods)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise the head of your child's bed by 6 to 8 inches (for example, by putting blocks of wood or rubber under 2 legs of the bed or a Styrofoam wedge under the mattress). Do <strong>not</strong> raise the head of an infant's crib or bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help your child to lose weight, if he or she is overweight (ask your child's doctor or nurse for advice on how to do this)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your child away from cigarette smoke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child avoid lying down for a few hours after a meal</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2271560\"><span class=\"h1\">How is acid reflux treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most times, acid reflux symptoms can be treated with medicines. There are 3 main types of medicines that can help: antacids, histamine blockers, and proton pump inhibitors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78918 \">table 1</a>). All of these medicines work by reducing or blocking stomach acid. But they each do that in a different way:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antacids can relieve mild symptoms, but they work only for a short time. You can buy them without a prescription. Children younger than school age should <strong>not</strong> take antacids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histamine blockers are stronger and last longer than antacids. You can also buy most histamine blockers without a prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proton pump inhibitors are the most effective medicines in treating GERD. You can buy some of these medicines without a prescription. But there are other versions that your child's doctor or nurse can prescribe.</p><p/><p>If you child's doctor or nurse recommends a medicine, he or she will usually suggest that your child try the medicine for a few weeks first. Then if symptoms do not get better, the doctor or nurse might suggest a different medicine, or decide to do tests.</p><p>Sometimes acid reflux medicines are less expensive if you get them with a prescription. Other times nonprescription medicines are less expensive. If cost is a concern for you, ask your pharmacist how you might reduce the cost of your child's medicines.</p><p>Talk to your child's doctor or nurse before you give your child <strong>any</strong> medicines for reflux.</p><p>A few children need surgery to treat their GERD. This is more likely in children who have a problem with the brain or spinal cord (such as cerebral palsy), and if the GERD is causing problems like pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2271619\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in babies (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
