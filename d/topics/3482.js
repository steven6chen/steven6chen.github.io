CMML is characterized by a peripheral blood monocytosis accompanied by bone marrow dysplasia; cytopenias and hepatosplenomegaly are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110229\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110229 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>There is a propensity for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is defined by &ge;20 percent marrow blast cells. Although historically considered a subtype of MDS, CMML is a clinically and genetically distinct entity with a unique clinical presentation and natural history. CMML is among the most aggressive chronic leukemias, and there are fewer effective therapies than for most other hematologic malignancies. However, murine models and genomic data have laid a scientific foundation for the generation of novel therapeutics that is anticipated to broaden treatment options for CMML patients.</p><p>The epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of CMML will be reviewed here. Other myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37528745\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of CMML is poorly understood. CMML is thought to arise via the serial acquisition of somatic genetic events that aggregate by Darwinian principles into distinct neoplastic cell clones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most cases of CMML appear to comprise more than one clone and are genetically dynamic. Many of the genetic mutations identified in patients with CMML induce a CMML phenotype in murine models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Although CMML does have a distinct &quot;genetic fingerprint&quot; (ie, a unique frequency and pattern of mutated genes), there is no single disease-defining mutation or chromosomal abnormality.</p><p>The most common cytogenetic abnormalities observed in CMML are rearrangements or deletions of chromosome 7, and trisomy 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Marrow and blood cells from most patients with CMML have acquired mutations in genes that encode epigenetic modifiers (eg, <em>TET2</em>, <em>ASXL1</em>, <em>EZH2</em>), regulators of alternative mRNA splicing (eg, <em>SRSF2</em>, <em>SF3B1</em>, <em>ZRSF2</em>), transcription factors (eg, <em>RUNX1</em>), and cytokine signaling (eg, <em>NRAS</em>, <em>CBL</em>, <em>KRAS</em>, <em>JAK2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Similar to the closely related pediatric disease juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a large fraction of CMML cases display hypersensitivity to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in vitro, which likely contributes to the monocytosis characteristic of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. These data suggest that the genetic pathogenesis of CMML is complex but converges on a phenotype that is skewed towards monocytic hematopoiesis and GM-CSF hypersensitivity.</p><p>Because there is overlap in the mutations observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and CMML, the genetic determinants that govern the CMML phenotype are an active area of research. Single colony sequencing analysis has suggested that early clonal dominance of founder mutations, such as <em>TET2</em>, may be a key distinguishing pathogenic feature of CMML compared with MDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It is unclear what microenvironmental factors in the marrow allow for early clonal dominance and other potential genetically unique features of CMML. Certain gene mutations are enriched in CMML cases. Mutations in <em>SRSF2</em> and <em>ASXL1</em>, for instance, each occur at frequencies approaching 50 percent in CMML, which is much higher than the frequency with which either mutation is seen in MDS (&lt;20 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. Mutations in signaling pathway genes like <em>JAK2</em>, <em>NRAS</em>, and <em>CBL</em> are common in CMML and rare in MDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H4008903\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Rearrangements of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (<em>PDGFR</em>) were previously considered a recurrent pathogenetic feature of CMML. However, <em>PDGFR</em>-rearranged cases uniformly demonstrate eosinophilia and are often sensitive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy, while CMML is not associated with eosinophilia and is not sensitive to imatinib. As a result, the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification schema considers cases with <em>PDGFR</em> abnormalities (including those associated with monocytosis) as a distinct genetically-defined disease category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Myeloid HES variants'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37528751\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMML occurs most commonly in older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 65 to 75 years. There is a moderate male predominance. The precise incidence is not known; however, estimates from cancer databases indicate that there are approximately 1000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States, with a crude annual incidence rate of 0.3 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A similar incidence rate has been reported in a Spanish population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The actual incidence of CMML may be higher than that predicted by cancer databases since the nonspecific symptoms may evade detection in early stages of the disease, while other cases may not undergo definitive testing, such as bone marrow biopsy, due to comorbidities and very advanced age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Further, many CMML cases may be classified as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) rather than CMML, especially cases without leukocytosis.</p><p>Therapy-related CMML represented approximately 10 percent of CMML cases in a single institution study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Secondary CMML, defined as CMML arising from an antecedent case of MDS, has also been described to occur at a frequency of approximately 6 percent of all CMML cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The literature describing environmental exposure and risk of CMML is limited. Given the mutational and pathological overlap between CMML and <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> and similar median age at diagnosis, some investigators have speculated that known <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> risk factors such as ionizing radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, benzene or other hydrocarbons, agricultural chemicals, and tobacco smoke may prove to be risk factors for CMML. However, evidence is currently inconclusive. There are no reported kindreds of familial CMML, but several congenital syndromes are associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) such as Noonan Syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H91823203\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of genetic damage'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37528757\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37528764\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms at presentation of CMML are non-specific. Patients may come to the physician's attention based upon abnormalities found on routine blood counts (eg, anemia, neutropenia, monocytosis, or thrombocytopenia). Other patients present with symptoms or complications resulting from a previously unrecognized cytopenia (eg, infection, fatigue, dyspnea, petechiae, hemorrhage), skin lesions, or symptoms related to splenomegaly (eg, early satiety, abdominal fullness).</p><p>CMML is characterized by the overproduction of peripheral monocytic cells and sometimes dysplastic neutrophils, often accompanied by anemia or thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Dramatic leukocytosis can also be seen without transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML); in some cases, this leukocytosis is associated with leukostasis and end organ damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis in hematologic malignancies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H37530089\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral blood'</a> below.)</p><p>Splenomegaly is present in up to 25 percent of patients with CMML and is often accompanied by hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or nodular cutaneous leukemic infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. Gingival infiltration is occasionally observed but is much rarer than in AML with monocytic differentiation; central nervous system involvement is rare. Pleural and pericardial effusions and ascites can occur in CMML with very high monocyte counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and these signs often resolve with antileukemic therapy. Constitutional symptoms (ie, fevers, unexplained weight loss, and night sweats) are seen in some CMML cases and are similar to the symptoms associated with primary myelofibrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-primary-myelofibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serologic polyclonal gammopathy was found in 47 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Muramidase (lysozyme) activity may be increased in the blood or urine, reflecting the marked monocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Lysozymuria may be associated with urinary potassium wasting, hypokalemia, and elevated serum creatinine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A coagulopathy may be present due to binding of factor X to abnormal monocytes, leading to an acquired factor X deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H16897924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Salt-wasting nephropathies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37528770\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients will demonstrate involvement of the peripheral blood and bone marrow at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Extramedullary infiltration of the spleen, liver, skin, and lymph nodes are less common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37530089\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cases of CMML have a persistent peripheral blood monocyte count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1000/microL</span> that makes up &gt;10 percent of the entire leukocyte differential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85880\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85880 \">picture 1</a>). Patients with extreme leukocytosis due to other causes, such as severe infection or therapy with hematopoietic growth factors, should not be confused with CMML, as while they may have an absolute monocyte count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1000/microL,</span> monocytes makes up only a small fraction of the total white blood cell count. Despite a relative increase in monocytes, the total white blood cell count is not increased in many CMML cases. Myeloid dysplasia may be seen in all myeloid subsets, and unique abnormal mononuclear cells exhibiting features intermediate between myelocytes and monocytes, termed &quot;paramyeloid cells,&quot; are often apparent. By definition, the peripheral blood blast percentage must be lower than 20 percent. Cytopenias and other common features of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), such as neutrophil hypolobation, may be seen in the peripheral blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37530095\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bone marrow in CMML is uniformly hypercellular, with increased mononuclear cells and their progenitors, as well as abnormal mononuclear cells exhibiting features intermediate between myelocytes and monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Cells of the monocytic line can be distinguished from granulocytic myeloid precursors using a combined esterase stain.</p><p>There are &lt;20 percent blasts in the bone marrow in CMML. &quot;Blasts&quot; include myeloblasts, monoblasts, and promonocytes; the latter are treated as blast equivalents. Mature monocytes displaying atypical cytologic features are common and are excluded from the blast count. These distinctions can be challenging for morphologists, especially if cellular atypia is striking. Auer rods are absent. The myeloid:erythoid ratio is often increased. Dysplasia in the bone marrow is frequently identified, similar to that seen in cases of MDS. However, dysplastic features are generally more subtle in CMML compared with MDS and are often identified in &lt;10 percent of mononuclear cells counted. Ring sideroblasts have also been reported in CMML, but the biologic and prognostic significance of this remains unclear.</p><p>Megakaryocyte dysplasia in CMML is distinguished from that seen in MDS in that &quot;myeloproliferative megakaryocytes&quot; (ie, large cells with hyperlobated nuclei that cluster) are often seen intermixed with &quot;MDS megakaryocytes&quot; (ie, small solitary cells with hypolobated nuclei). Fibrosis can be seen in bone marrow of CMML cases as in MDS, but the significance of this finding is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37530101\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical genetic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytogenetic abnormalities are identified in 30 percent of CMML cases. Given that dysplasia is often subtle in CMML and clonal karyotypic markers are absent in 70 percent of cases, clinicians are often faced with the diagnostic challenge of a patient who has persistent monocytosis in whom benign causes of monocytosis cannot be excluded. It is within this clinical scenario that mutational analysis can be beneficial. Genetic profiling can be done using cells from the bone marrow or peripheral blood. In one analysis, sequencing nine genes (ie, <em>SRSF2, ASXL1, CBL, EZH2, JAK2, KRAS, NRAS, RUNX1</em>, and <em>TET2</em>) could identify a clonal event in &gt;90 percent of suspected CMML cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Detection of a somatic mutation provides definitive evidence of clonality, which along with persistent monocytosis supports a diagnosis of CMML. Further, mutational profiling is integrated in several prognostic scores that accurately risk stratify cases of CMML. (See <a href=\"#H37528818\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H37528745\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1283776935\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37528776\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of suspected cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CMML should be considered when persistent, unexplained peripheral monocytosis is present in an older adult (median age at diagnosis: 65 to 75 years). Monocytosis should be especially evaluated in any patient with a pathologic diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as peripheral monocytosis is the sole clinical differentiator of CMML in many cases.</p><p>A careful history should elicit details regarding persistence of monocytosis, manifestations of cytopenias and splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, transfusional history, infection, and chemotherapeutic exposure. Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear and a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are key components to the diagnosis of CMML. Conditions that present with features similar to CMML must be ruled out (eg, chronic myeloid leukemia). In addition, clinicians may wish to perform some of the tests recommended for the pretreatment evaluation of patients with CMML in concert with the initial evaluation. These are described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H1283777485\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Even in the setting of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or coagulopathy, it is unusual for bleeding or infection to develop at the site of marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/biopsy</span> as a complication of the procedure. The preferred biopsy location in adults is the posterior superior iliac crest and spine, although a different site should be used if the patient has received prior irradiation to this area. The sternum is an alternative site for bone marrow aspiration, although bone marrow biopsy cannot be performed at this site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: Indications and technique&quot;, section on 'Choice of aspiration or biopsy site'</a>.)</p><p>The bone marrow evaluation should include karyotype analysis by conventional cytogenetics. If no dividing cells are present for G-banding analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) should be performed to exclude the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene and chromosome 5q31-33 translocations involving the PDGFRB gene. Comprehensive mutation analysis should be considered for patients with non-diagnostic cell morphology and normal cytogenetics, in order to establish clonality. (See <a href=\"#H37530101\" class=\"local\">'Clinical genetic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Occasional patients may have a &quot;dry tap&quot; on aspiration, due to the presence of extensive fibrosis. An adequate bone marrow biopsy with touch preparations should provide sufficient material for diagnostic purposes in situations when the marrow cannot be aspirated. A portion of the biopsy can be submitted in saline or, preferably, culture medium (eg, Roswell Park Memorial Institute culture medium, RPMI) and teased apart in the flow cytometry laboratory in an attempt to isolate a cell suspension for analysis.</p><p>Careful inspection of the peripheral blood smear and bone marrow aspirate is necessary to document the dysplastic cytologic features identifiable in any or all of the hematopoietic lineages. The bone marrow biopsy gives a general overview of the degree of involvement and specific histologic features associated with the process (eg, fibrosis). Since the diagnosis relies heavily on morphologic changes, the quality of the smears is of the utmost importance. Slides should be made from freshly obtained specimens; slides made from specimens exposed to anticoagulants for two or more hours are not satisfactory.</p><p>To determine the blast percentage in the peripheral blood, a 200 leukocyte differential is recommended; buffy coat smears may be necessary in severely cytopenic patients. The percentage of blasts in the marrow should be calculated from a 500 cell differential count performed on the bone marrow aspirate. Blast counts from the aspirate are superior to those calculated from a flow specimen since the latter may be influenced by hemodilution and artifacts produced by specimen preparation (eg, red cell lysis techniques, density gradient centrifugation) and the approach through which different cell populations are selected for gating.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37528782\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CMML should be considered in all patients with persistent, unexplained peripheral monocytosis. The diagnosis is usually made based upon findings in the peripheral blood and bone marrow as interpreted within the clinical context. In the absence of genetic abnormalities, a diagnosis of CMML should be established only after the patient has been followed for weeks to months with repeated laboratory testing rather than applying the diagnosis based upon the first abnormal peripheral blood count.</p><p>The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for the diagnosis of CMML include all of the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110229\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110229 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent (&ge;3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis; <strong>absolute monocyte count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1000/microL</strong></span> and greater than 10 percent of the entire white blood cell differential </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not meeting WHO criteria for <em>BCR-ABL1</em> positive chronic myeloid leukemia, primary myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, or essential thrombocytosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&lt;20 percent myeloblasts + monoblasts + promonocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysplastic changes in one or more myeloid lineages.

A prior diagnosis of a myeloproliferative disorder excludes CMML. In contrast, the presence of mutations commonly seen in myeloproliferative neoplasms (<em>JAK2</em>, <em>CALR</em>, or <em>MPL</em>) favors a diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasm with monocytosis rather than CMML. While the presence of gene mutations associated with CMML (<em>TET2</em>, <em>SRSF2</em>, <em>ASXL1</em>, <em>SETBP1</em>) are supportive of the diagnosis of CMML, they may also represent age-related acquired mutations or subclones.

The entities considered in a specific case depend largely upon the presenting features. As examples, in cases presenting with significant dysplasia, it is important to consider myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as other entities. The following sections describe the most common entities that should be considered.</p><p>One study suggested that many of these alternative diagnoses could be ruled out when CD14+CD16- monocytes account for &gt;94 percent of total monocytes on flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

All of the prognostic tools utilize clinical features and laboratory findings, while some also incorporate cytogenetic or mutation analysis. Some of the tools were designed primarily for MDS, but also included some patients with CMML, such as the 1997 MDS International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Although each of these models provides prognostic guidance, some systems may be more vulnerable than others to &quot;up-staging&quot; in which a patient classified in a lower risk group by one prognostic model would be re-classified as having higher risk disease with a competing CMML model. The abundance of prognostic tools highlights the clinical importance of accurately estimating survival in CMML cases, but the number of tools has resulted in wide variation in CMML approaches between different institutions. As it is not clear that any one is superior to the others, any of the models may be useful in clinical practice.

Immunizations should be updated, particularly against pneumococcus, and the annual influenza vaccine should be recommended. Patients should be treated as needed with antibiotics for infection and red cell and platelet transfusions for symptomatic anemia or thrombocytopenia, respectively. The approach is similar to that taken for patients with MDS.

The examinations included in the response assessment depend at least partially upon the goals of therapy and how treatment decisions may change based upon the results. We follow all patients with complete blood counts in order to assess hematologic improvement. A bone marrow aspirate with or without biopsy is performed if cell counts deteriorate more than anticipated to evaluate for possible progression to acute myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Alternatively, some clinicians perform a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate after two to four cycles of hypomethylating agent therapy to help guide further treatment for patients receiving active therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H797001604\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the signs and symptoms associated with CMML are distinct from those associated with MDS, response to CMML therapy is incompletely described using MDS response criteria. In evaluating the efficacy of a therapy, it is particularly important to recognize whether there is improvement in myeloproliferative signs and symptoms, such as splenomegaly and leukocytosis, that are not included in MDS response criteria yet can be an important source of morbidity.

It is among the most aggressive chronic leukemias and has a limited therapeutic armamentarium compared with many other hematologic malignancies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The genetic pathogenesis of CMML is complex but converges on a phenotype that is skewed towards monocytic hematopoiesis and GM-CSF hypersensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H37528745\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CMML should be considered when persistent, unexplained peripheral monocytosis is present in an older adult. Monocytosis should be especially evaluated in any patient with a pathologic diagnosis of MDS as it is the peripheral monocytosis that is the sole differentiator of CMML in many cases. (See <a href=\"#H37528757\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is usually made based upon findings in the peripheral blood and bone marrow as interpreted within the clinical context. In the absence of genetic abnormalities, a diagnosis of CMML should be established only after the patient has been followed for weeks to months with repeated laboratory testing rather than applying the diagnosis based upon the first abnormal peripheral blood count. (See <a href=\"#H37528782\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMML must be distinguished from other entities that may also present with monocytosis or dysplasia. Cases by definition do <strong>not</strong> exhibit evidence of BCR-ABL1 or the Philadelphia chromosome or rearrangements of the genes encoding the platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA or PDGFRB), FGFR1, or PCM1-JAK2. (See <a href=\"#H37528788\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general prognosis of patients with CMML is poor, with an expected median survival of approximately 30 months. Several risk stratification models are available for estimating the prognosis of patients in clinical practice. (See <a href=\"#H37528818\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is presently the only therapeutic maneuver that can substantively alter the natural history of CMML, resulting in cure in a small proportion of patients. Patients with low risk disease by both the MDACC and Mayo scoring systems can delay transplant until progression. All other patients should be offered the opportunity to discuss this procedure with a transplantation physician. The final decision on transplant eligibility should be made based on an individualized risk-benefit assessment. (See <a href=\"#H37528831\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1283779005\" class=\"local\">'HCT eligibility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outside of allo-HCT, there is no pharmacologic agent that has been proven to alter the natural history of this disease. Thus, we recommend that all CMML cases be considered for interventional clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H37528873\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those who are not candidates for allo-HCT and who decide not to participate in a clinical trial, we suggest symptom-directed therapy with either cytoreductive therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a>) or hypomethylating agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Cytoreductive therapy is usually preferred for patients with dramatic proliferative symptoms, while hypomethylating agents are preferred for patients with cytopenias and those with myeloproliferative symptoms in whom hydroxyurea is ineffective. (See <a href=\"#H37528849\" class=\"local\">'Symptom-directed therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care remains a central component of the management of all patients with CMML. Immunizations should be updated. Patients should be treated as needed with antibiotics for infection and red cell and platelet transfusions for symptomatic anemia or thrombocytopenia, respectively. The approach is similar to that taken for patients with MDS.
