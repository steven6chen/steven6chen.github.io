Successful treatment of a brain abscess requires a high index of suspicion for the infection, which can have subtle presentations and frequently requires a combination of drainage and antimicrobial therapy.

A significant drawback to vancomycin is its poor penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of approximately 1 and 5 percent of the serum concentration with uninflamed and inflamed meninges, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> can be added to vancomycin at a dose of 600 mg orally once daily or 300 to 450 mg twice daily because it achieves bactericidal concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid regardless of meningeal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/8,9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,13</a>], although there are few data to support this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].<br/><br/>Based upon case reports and case series of patients with central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by MRSA, alternatives to vancomycin include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> (600 mg IV or orally twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> component IV every 8 to 12 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/9,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21,22</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daptomycin</a> (6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV once daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Although there are insufficient data regarding the efficacy of these regimens for the treatment of CNS infections caused by MRSA, these agents are reasonable alternatives when vancomycin cannot be used or is ineffective. Further studies are needed to establish the benefit of these agents for the treatment of CNS infections. This is discussed in greater detail separately.

This recommendation derives from retrospective reports and reviews since no clinical trials have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. United Kingdom guidelines recommend four to six weeks if the abscess has been drained or excised and six to eight weeks if the abscess is treated without drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One retrospective study reported recurrent brain abscesses in patients who received antibiotics for less than three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a retrospective study of patients with brain abscesses, the median duration of therapy was 62 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The duration of therapy should be guided by follow-up assessment of clinical course and imaging studies; antibiotic therapy is continued until there is a good clinical response and substantial improvement of imaging findings. Computed tomographic (CT) scan is helpful in monitoring the response to antibiotics; the size of the abscess or abscesses should decrease over time. We recommend not using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for follow-up because abnormalities persist for months, and clinicians utilizing MRI often continue antibiotics for unnecessarily long periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Contrast enhancement at the site of the abscess may persist for several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

However, in one study, stereotactic needle aspiration was accompanied by a need for more prolonged antibiotic therapy and a more prolonged postoperative neurologic recovery time compared with open surgical excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>A Burr hole is placed and then needle aspiration is performed under CT or ultrasonography guidance. It is important that the aspirate be cultured for aerobes and anaerobes, fungi, and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.

An elevated C-reactive protein on admission may predict the need for repeated aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Under certain circumstances, drainage may be delayed or not required:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early cerebritis without evidence of cerebral necrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abscesses located in vital regions of the brain or those inaccessible to aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]</p><p/><p>When the decision is made not to drain immediately, follow-up with sequential CT or MRI is critical.
