It provides protection to the urethral meatus and glans penis.</p><p>The normal foreskin begins to develop as an epithelial fold that grows inward from the base of the glans penis at eight to nine weeks gestation with normal completion by 4 to 4.5 months gestation. The squamous epithelial lining of the inner prepuce is contiguous with the glans penis, resulting in the normal circumferentially initial adhesions between the inner layer of the prepuce and the glabrous epithelium of the glans penis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86213584\"><span class=\"h1\">FORESKIN RETRACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Separation of the foreskin from the glans penis occurs by desquamation and begins late in gestation, but remains incomplete in most male infants at birth. Only approximately 4 percent of males have a completely retractable foreskin at birth, and in more than half of newborn males, the foreskin cannot be retracted far enough to visualize the urethral meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>After birth, penile growth and physiologic erection aid in the desquamation process and the formation of keratinized pearls (smegma) between the layers, which loosens the adhesions and allows retraction of the preputial skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86213710\"><span class=\"h2\">Phimosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phimosis is defined as an inability to retract the foreskin (prepuce). The incidence of fully retractable foreskin increases with age as the rate of phimosis decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of 2149 Taiwanese school boys, which reported the incidence of the following five categories of preputial anatomy for three different age groups based on grade level; first, fourth, and seventh grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fully retractable: 8, 21, and 58 percent, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial retraction with part of the glans penis visible: 40, 41, and 29 percent, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial phimosis with only the urethral meatus visible and none of the glans penis: 33, 25, and 7 percent, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phimosis with nonvisualization of the meatus and glans: 17, 10, and 1 percent, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumcised: 3, 4, and 5 percent, respectively</p><p/><p>Phimosis is divided into physiologic and pathologic forms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic phimosis, which is seen in almost all newborn males, is due to the normal development of congenital adhesions between the foreskin and glans.

(See <a href=\"#H172410114\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic phimosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic phimosis is defined as foreskin that is truly nonretractable secondary to distal scarring of the prepuce, such as occurs with preputial fibrosis due to infection and inflammation. This scarring often appears as a contracted white fibrous ring around the preputial orifice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53082\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53082 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Differences in cohort age and the definition of pathologic phimosis are responsible for this great rate variability.</p><p/><p>It is important for primary care clinicians to be able to distinguish between physiologic and pathologic phimosis so that unnecessary referrals to pediatric urologists can be avoided for the patient and his family. Based on the results of the above study and other reports, it appears that the incidence of pathologic phimosis that requires intervention is very low, especially in preadolescent and adolescent males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9377172\"><span class=\"h1\">ROUTINE CARE AND HYGIENE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to educate both parents and care providers on the routine care and hygiene of the uncircumcised male infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The penis should be washed regularly when a bath is given. Soap can be used provided it is nonirritant and safe for the child's age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent diaper changes to prevent diaper rash and decrease skin irritation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid forcible retraction because tearing may cause bleeding, and can result in fibrosis and the development of pathologic phimosis. Gentle retraction of the foreskin with diaper changes and bathing will allow gradual and progressive retraction of the foreskin over the glans. As the foreskin naturally begins to retract, cleaning and then drying underneath the foreskin can be performed. After bathing, the retracted foreskin should always be pulled down to its normal position covering the glans penis. Failure to do so may result in paraphimosis (when the foreskin is retracted behind the glans penis and cannot be returned to its normal position), which results in venous and lymphatic congestion of the glans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76100\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76100 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraphimosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraphimosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As the boy becomes older, he should be instructed on retraction of the foreskin, regular cleaning and drying of the glans, and returning the foreskin to its normal position.</p><p/><p>During the newborn examination and well-child visits, assessment should include evaluation of the urinary stream and include the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the urinary stream strong?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the urinary stream straight?

In some cases, urinary stream abnormalities may be due to complications of the foreskin.

Although the spontaneous resolution of physiologic phimosis is high, the rate is variable so it is not possible to set an age by which the foreskin should be normally retractile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2,3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,13</a>]. School-age boys without a fully retractible foreskin and their parents should be counseled that there is normally a wide range of retractibility rate, and over time, there is a very high likelihood physiologic phimosis will spontaneously resolve. The clinician should also reinforce proper preputial hygiene; patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parents can be taught to perform gentle stretch exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A four- to eight-week course of topical corticosteroids (eg, 0.05% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> cream) applied directly to the preputial outlet twice daily speeds up the natural process of obtaining foreskin retractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5,9-11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-11,14</a>].

In boys without a fully retractible foreskin, smegma may form white lumps under the foreskin, often referred to as preputial cysts. Preputial cysts are benign and usually are located around the corona.

However, if after circumcision BXO is persistent, then meatal reconstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a dermatology consult may be necessary.</p><p>In one case series from Children's Hospital Boston over a 10-year period from 1992 to 2002, none of the 41 patients (mean age 10.6 years) with pathologically confirmed BXO were diagnosed prior to referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In males with frenulum breve, the frenulum is too short, and thus restricts the movement of the foreskin. This condition is typically more symptomatic during an erection as the short frenulum pulls the glans ventrally with erection, leading to pain. In severe cases, during sexual stimulation the frenulum can rupture, leading to discomfort and bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

After birth, penile growth and physiologic erection aid in the desquamation process that loosens the adhesions and leads to progressive foreskin retraction. (See <a href=\"#H86213584\" class=\"local\">'Foreskin retraction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phimosis is defined as an inability to retract the foreskin (prepuce) and is divided in two forms. (See <a href=\"#H86213710\" class=\"local\">'Phimosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Physiologic phimosis due to the normal congenital adhesions between the foreskin and glans seen in almost all normal male newborn infants. This condition normally resolves throughout childhood with an incidence of approximately 1 percent in seventh grade boys.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pathologic due to scarring of the foreskin leading to a true nonretractable foreskin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the following routine care of the uncircumcised penis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9377172\" class=\"local\">'Routine care and hygiene'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The penis should be washed routinely during the normal bathing of any male infant or boy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid forcible retraction. As the foreskin naturally begins to retract, cleaning and then drying underneath the foreskin can be performed. The foreskin should always be pulled down to its normal position covering the glans after drying.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In any child who is not toilet trained, frequent diaper changes to prevent diaper rash and <span class=\"nowrap\">foreskin/urethra</span> irritation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During routine well-child visits, inclusion of a voiding history to uncover any urinary stream abnormality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign conditions seen in uncircumcised males include physiologic phimosis, preputial cysts due to smegma, and transient ballooning of the foreskin that resolves without manual pressure. Parents should be reassured that these are normal <span class=\"nowrap\">variations/findings</span> that generally do not need any intervention. (See <a href=\"#H86214258\" class=\"local\">'Benign conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications that typically require intervention include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pathologic phimosis increases the risk of other foreskin complications, such as paraphimosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">recurrent/severe</span> balanoposthitis, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Although several treatment options are available, we suggest initial treatment with a topical corticosteroid (eg, 0.05% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> cream twice daily) along with gentle retraction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Other options include stretch exercises alone and corrective surgery including circumcision. (See <a href=\"#H172410341\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic phimosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paraphimosis, a medical emergency, is caused by foreskin entrapment behind the coronal sulcus, which may result in venous and lymphatic congestion of the glans and ultimately arterial compromise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76100\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76100 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraphimosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraphimosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is 4- to 10-fold greater in uncircumcised versus circumcised male infants. In boys with recurrent UTI, or who have UTI and evidence of genitourinary abnormality (eg, renal scarring and vesicoureteral reflux), circumcision may be considered as a potential intervention to decrease the risk of future UTI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Balanoposthitis, inflammation of the glans penis and the foreskin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67724\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67724 \">picture 4</a>), typically results from poor hygiene that is sometimes complicated by secondary infection. In severe cases, patients may be unable to void, in which case bladder catheterization is indicated. In patients with urinary obstruction, in whom bladder catheterization is unsuccessful, dorsal slit procedure or incision of a constricting band resulting in phimosis may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanoposthitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Balanoposthitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanoposthitis-in-children-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Balanoposthitis in children: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is a chronic atrophic dermatitis characterized by white atrophic plaques on the glans and prepuce. These plaques eventually enlarge and coalesce into a sclerotic mass with resultant adhesions, pathologic phimosis, and meatal stenosis. In these patients, we suggest circumcision because other treatment options have not been effective (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
