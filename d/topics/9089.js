The majority of diabetic pregnancies are gestational diabetes, or GDM, affecting 3 to 5 percent of all pregnancies. GDM is defined as the occurrence of diabetes during pregnancy in a woman not known to have been diabetic before the pregnancy. Nevertheless, many women who are diabetic during pregnancy have preexistent diabetes, usually type 2 or type 1 diabetes. The incidence of GDM and of pregnancies in women with preexistent type 2 diabetes is likely to increase in the near future because of the epidemic of childhood obesity that is already well established in the United States, especially among certain ethnic populations such as Hispanics and African Americans. The obese Hispanic woman with preexistent diabetes who is presented in this case is an example of this epidemiologic pattern.</p><p>Excellent metabolic control of diabetes before and during pregnancy is an essential part of the care of diabetic women of childbearing age (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregestational diabetes mellitus: Glycemic control during pregnancy&quot;</a>). Pregnancy in diabetes is associated with an increased risk of congenital anomalies and an increased incidence of spontaneous abortions. Meticulous metabolic control before conception reduces these risks appreciably. Nevertheless, only a small fraction of women with type 2 diabetes seeks or obtains prepregnancy counseling and care. While those who do not obtain such care and do not achieve satisfactory metabolic control before conception are at increased risk of delivering a child with one or more congenital anomalies or of losing the pregnancy, there are many other reasons to pursue optimal metabolic control in those pregnant diabetic patients who come to attention after conception, including women with GDM and those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Such control can reduce or eliminate the complications of diabetic pregnancy that occur during pregnancy and at term, including fetal macrosomia (and its complications, including birth trauma to mother and child), neonatal hypoglycemia, and other neonatal complications (including hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, and respiratory distress).</p><p>In the second and third trimesters, a glycated hemoglobin (A1C) of &lt;6 percent is associated with the lowest risk of large-for-gestational-age infants. Other adverse outcomes increase with A1C values of &ge;6.5 percent. Accordingly, a target of 6 to 6.5 percent is recommended, but less than 6 percent may be optimal if these levels can be achieved without hypoglycemia.</p><p>The patient developed proliferative diabetic retinopathy during pregnancy despite improved metabolic control during pregnancy. She was at risk for this complication because of poor metabolic control for many years. Although she was at increased risk of preeclampsia and was admitted with proteinuria at one point, this diagnosis was not established. The delivery was uneventful, and the child was healthy.</p><p>Optimal care of the pregnant diabetic patient is labor intensive for the patient and her health care providers. The achievement of optimal metabolic control requires frequent glucose testing, frequent interactions between the patient and her medical team, close monitoring by a retinal specialist, and frequent obstetrical monitoring. Although these requirements demand time and effort, pregnant patients are often eager to cooperate, motivated by their hopes for a healthy child, their fear of the dreaded complications of diabetic pregnancy, and the knowledge that these demands are for a finite period of time. Too often, women who meet these demands during pregnancy do not maintain their efforts postpartum and their metabolic control deteriorates, owing in part to the new demands of caring for an infant.</p><p>In one sense, management of a diabetic patient during pregnancy is comparable to management of any diabetic patient, with frequent glucose testing, adherence to diet, and appropriate adjustments in insulin doses. However, the demands are greater because of the need for more frequent monitoring and adjustments and challenging because the diabetic pregnancy has different requirements for monitoring, different glucose targets for metabolic control, and different algorithms for insulin use. In addition, the patient needs monitoring by a retinal specialist and an obstetrician. For these reasons, it is usually appropriate to refer a diabetic patient who wishes to become pregnant or a pregnant diabetic patient to a center with a multidisciplinary team including an endocrinologist, a certified diabetes educator, a registered dietitian, a retinal specialist, an obstetrician, and supporting staff. When this cannot be done, the clinician should attempt to assemble such a team to the extent possible.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-11-a-34-year-old-pregnant-woman-with-type-2-diabetes-comment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-11-a-34-year-old-pregnant-woman-with-type-2-diabetes-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jovanovic L, Nakai Y.
