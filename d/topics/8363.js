Management strategies for abnormal screening results are based upon evidence from large prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. In current practice, cervical cytology and HPV cotesting are used routinely in women ages 30 to 64 years. In addition, there is interim guidance from the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on the use of HPV testing alone for primary screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Based on these changes in practice, the need to interpret HPV test results is a common issue for clinicians.</p><p>There are many potential combinations of cervical cytology and HPV results, and some of these combinations or serial testing results are not addressed by guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, some laboratories offer tests that are not included in current screening guidelines. These include commercial tests that detect late biologic events that are associated with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. Such tests rely on molecular markers that are highly associated with clinically relevant cervical neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Just as importantly, being negative for these markers is significantly associated with almost no risk of disease. Currently used tests that meet these criteria include tests that focus on <span class=\"nowrap\">p16/Ki-67</span> and E6 and E7, which are HPV oncoproteins; some of these are commercially available.</p><p>Clinicians may find it challenging to interpret the abundance of clinical data and to choose the next appropriate management steps. The aim of this topic is to assist clinicians in interpreting the evidence, guidelines, and to make sense of the growing body of tests, to be able to individualize management when algorithms are not useful.</p><p>Management of abnormal HPV testing of the cervix is discussed here.

The risk of cervical cancer is determined based on the test results, and this guides which next step to choose in evaluation or management. Next-step options include continued routine screening, active surveillance (more frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> additional tests), colposcopy, or treatment (eg, cervical conization, ablative therapy). </p><p>To determine the risks associated with common screening test results, the benchmarks for the risk of cervical cancer have been calculated based on data from a large cohort of women followed in the Kaiser Permanente health network in California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The size of this United States-based screening population allows for high-quality risk calculations. There are some limitations to these data, including the inclusion of adolescents, younger women, and treated patients (leaving a lower-risk population in the remaining patients). Despite the sheer number and volume of data, some risk calculations cannot be made with certainty, and must be extrapolated based on the available data and expert opinion. </p><p>The same approach should be applied to patients who have a set of cervical cancer screening results that are rare or do not conform exactly to management guidelines. A clinician should estimate the risk of cancer and let this guide further management, even for results that fall outside of what can be drawn from the benchmarking studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2777968613\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to cytology and HPV test results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, cytology is a marker for <strong>current </strong>risk of clinically relevant disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or more severe [CIN 2+]), while HPV testing, and more so HPV genotyping (testing for individual HPV strains, eg, 16 or 18), is an excellent marker for predicting <strong>future</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>risk of CIN 2+.</p><p>In clinical decision-making, if there is knowledge of past <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> present HPV results, or if there is persistence of HPV positivity (defined as consecutively positive HPV results at least 12 months apart) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], this can greatly assist in the clinical decision-making of a patient&rsquo;s risk of having disease now or in the near future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2906170588\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE HPV TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several HPV testing systems available. These can be used for one or more types of testing: cotesting with cytology, reflex testing in response to a cervical cytology result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, primary screening with HPV testing alone, or HPV genotyping. All HPV tests currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are approved for cotesting with cervical cytology. Not all HPV tests are approved for primary cervical cancer screening and genotyping. </p><p>The term HPV testing refers to a test that is reported positive if any one or more of a set of high-risk types are detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76394 \">table 1</a>). The types that are tested have slight variation across tests, but all test at least for the 13 most common types. HPV genotyping refers to testing for individual HPV types, usually HPV 16 or 18, but some tests may also include HPV 45. </p><p>Clinical trial data vary for each HPV test, and there is also variability between laboratories with regard to performance. This furthers the challenges a clinician faces when individualizing care. In other words, each currently FDA-approved test has its own subtle differences in performance for identifying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or more severe (CIN 2+). As such, it is important to know which test is used by your laboratory or other commonly used laboratories and what the general performance is of those tests based on clinical trial data. Overall the performance is similar, but knowledge of subtle differences might be useful for explaining the information to the patients if questioned. For instance, if your lab uses a test that has a combined HPV <span class=\"nowrap\">18/45</span> endpoint instead of just HPV 18.</p><p>As testing technology evolves, future cervical screening guidelines may take these subtle performance differences into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. But for now, knowledge of the cytology result, HPV result, HPV genotyping (if done), and prior HPV results (to detect persistence) all play a role in deciding how to manage a patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556285883\"><span class=\"h1\">HPV-POSITIVE RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cancer screening guidelines advise HPV testing in women ages 30 to 64 years as cotesting with cervical cytology or as a reflex test when the Pap test result is atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89355\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89355 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>HPV testing is generally <strong>not</strong> recommended in women ages 21 to 29 years. Reflex testing may be performed with an ASC-US Pap, although repeat cytology in 12 months is the preferred next step (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89356\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89356 \">algorithm 2</a>). New HPV infections often occur soon after the onset of sexual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. As such, HPV infection is very common in women under age 25. However, clinically relevant disease related to women in this age group is exceedingly rare. If an HPV test is performed in young women and is positive, we use conservative approaches for management. These include more frequent follow-up cytology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HPV testing rather than colposcopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>HPV testing alone as a screening test has also been introduced, but opinions vary regarding the role of primary HPV testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

This happens in most women with a positive test, likely due to the appropriate immune response being generated to make the HPV infection latent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Keep in mind, it is likely that the HPV has not cleared, but is merely in a latent subclinical state below the threshold of the testing for being &quot;positive.&quot;</p><p>In some patients who have had HPV-positive and then HPV-negative testing, the positive HPV testing may recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Often, it is the same HPV type as a past infection, suggesting a &quot;reactivation&quot; from a latent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, it is impossible to prove or disprove if a current HPV infection is a new infection or reactivation of an old, latent infection. Many patients will ask about the timing of infection, but it is not possible to know this since an infection may be new or reactivated. </p><p>Patients should be counseled that most infections detected over the years of screening are reactivations of latent infections that are acquired at or near sexual debut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Reactivation of a latent infection could imply waning immunity, and the patient might be at increased risk of persistence. This is particularly common in immunocompromised individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>If a patient has a set of HPV and cytology results that are occasionally positive and occasionally negative over time, such equivocal results suggest a borderline latent infection and this patient should be managed with active surveillance. Active surveillance may be cytology and HPV cotesting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colposcopy every 12 months, depending on the results. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122968535\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent HPV-positive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent HPV infection (defined as consecutively positive HPV results at least 12 months apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]) is a necessary pathogenetic step for progression to clinically relevant disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or more severe [CIN 2+]). In patients who have persistent HPV infection, most, if not all, will eventually be diagnosed with CIN 2+ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one of the largest prospective screening trials that took place in Scandinavia, nearly all women who had persistent HPV infection developed CIN 2+ within five to seven years, many in as few as two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Because of this high-risk clinical scenario, women with persistent high-risk HPV infection should be managed with active surveillance and treatment, as indicated.</p><p>HPV and cervical cytology cotesting allows a clinician to better individualize management and determine if there is progression to CIN 2+ or likely regression. Some clinical examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient had normal cytology in the past and now has persistent HPV positivity and cytology with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), a clinician should be suspicious that this patient is going to have CIN 2+ disease at some time in the future. This patient has three likely outcomes: progression, continued equivocal results, or regression. There are no good surrogate testing markers to predict the direction the infection and disease will take. The patient should be evaluated with colposcopy, and if the results are negative or CIN, should be followed with active surveillance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversely, if a patient had HPV-positive testing and LSIL in the past and her last set of testing is HPV negative and negative cytology, then she is likely going to improve and her chances of CIN 2+ in the near future are very small.

After a thorough review of the literature, the group concluded that only p16 had sufficient data to be able to make a recommendation for use to aid in diagnosis. The LAST guidance allows for p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) to be used to clarify diagnosis. This has led to a considerable increase in a pathologists' use of p16 and an overall increase in the positive predictive value of p16. Such a result should prompt a clinician that the patient&rsquo;s precancer is likely progressing and should be treated according to histology.</p><p>Other tests have been developed, often combined with Ki-67, that can be used both on histology of biopsies and also to immunostain cytology. Dual immunostaining of cytology has also been tested as a potential triage test for women undergoing primary HPV screening. In the largest study using a commercial test, dual-stained cytology was more sensitive than a Pap for triaging HPV-positive women, whereas specificity was comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Dual-stained cytology was significantly more sensitive than Pap cytology (74.9 versus 51.9 percent) for triaging HPV-positive women, whereas specificity was comparable (74.1 versus 75.0 percent). </p><p>Other markers in development that might be offered in clinical laboratories include tests that focus on late events for CIN, including expression of HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Note, currently none of these tests are recommended in guidelines and are in varying levels of clinical development for determining their added roles, benefits, and risks above cytology or HPV testing alone. The overall thinking is these tests are very sensitive at picking up clinically relevant disease (CIN 2+), but a negative test does not mean lack of presence of clinically relevant disease. </p><p>One such test is based on expression of <span class=\"nowrap\">E6/E7</span> mRNA expression, which is ubiquitous in CIN 2+ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The overall goal of these sensitive molecular tests is to more accurately and specifically identify women who need colposcopy by enriching the referral population to those at highest risk. This should lead to less colposcopy for every CIN 2+ identified. Some of these tests will likely be considered in future management guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2237358008\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

There are many potential combinations of cervical cytology and HPV results, and some of these combinations or serial testing results are not addressed by guidelines. (See <a href=\"#H2075775641\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of abnormal results of cervical cancer screening tests is based upon the principle of &quot;equal management of equal risks.&quot; The risk of cervical cancer is determined based on the test results, and this guides the next steps in evaluation or management. Options include continued routine screening, active surveillance (more frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with additional tests), colposcopy, or treatment (eg, cervical conization, ablative therapy). (See <a href=\"#H1585419324\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for evaluation strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several HPV testing systems available. These can be used for cotesting with cytology, reflex testing in response to a cervical cytology result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), primary screening with HPV testing alone, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HPV genotyping (testing for a particular type). (See <a href=\"#H2906170588\" class=\"local\">'Available HPV tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with a positive HPV and negative cytology is at an increased risk of cervical neoplasia. The management of this may include repeat HPV and cytology cotesting at 12 months <strong>or</strong> HPV genotyping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89354\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89354 \">algorithm 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2736273026\" class=\"local\">'HPV-positive, cytology negative'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A recurrence of HPV-positive testing after a period of negative testing is often a &quot;reactivation&quot; from a latent infection, but may also be a new infection. (See <a href=\"#H340507868\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent HPV-positive'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent HPV infection (HPV-positive results at least 12 months apart) reflects an increased risk of development of or progression to clinically relevant disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or more severe [CIN 2+]). This is a high-risk scenario in a screening population and patients should be managed with active surveillance and treatment, as indicated. (See <a href=\"#H122968535\" class=\"local\">'Persistent HPV-positive'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient's testing is HPV positive for types 16 or 18, this result should supersede other testing, even if the patient's cytology is negative or ASC-US. HPV 16 or 18 positivity is the highest-risk clinical scenario and is an indication for immediate referral to colposcopy. (See <a href=\"#H3200571172\" class=\"local\">'HPV 16- or 18-positive'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytology reported as unsatisfactory must be repeated even if the result is reported as HPV negative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89352\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89352 \">algorithm 4</a>). An unsatisfactory cervical cytology specimen is considered unreliable for the evaluation of epithelial abnormalities and may also result in a false-negative HPV test. (See <a href=\"#H2889742518\" class=\"local\">'HPV-negative cytology unsatisfactory'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Massad LS, Einstein MH, Huh WK, et al. 2012 updated consensus guidelines for the management of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors.
