Affected patients develop numerous waxy firm papules and plaques that demonstrate mucin deposition, increased fibroblast proliferation, and fibrosis on histologic examination. Systemic manifestations may involve the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, renal, or nervous systems, and may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. </p><p>Scleromyxedema should be distinguished from localized lichen myxedematosus, a form of lichen myxedematosus that presents with waxy, firm papules and plaques involving limited areas. Unlike scleromyxedema, sclerotic features, systemic involvement, and monoclonal gammopathy are absent in localized lichen myxedematosus. Scleroderma and scleredema are additional disorders that present with sclerodermoid features but are unrelated to scleromyxedema. Scleromyxedema also is distinct from myxedema of thyroid disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scleredema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scleredema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Skin'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of scleromyxedema will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27631281\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scleromyxedema is a rare disease that usually affects middle-aged adults between the ages of 30 and 80 years with no race or sex predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a multicenter retrospective study of 30 patients with scleromyxedema, the mean age of affected patients was 59 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This illness has not been reported in infants and young children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27631287\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of scleromyxedema is unknown. The significance of the associated monoclonal gammopathy and the underlying plasma cell clone is debated. The main hypothesis is that circulating cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta, known to stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis and fibroblast proliferation in the skin, could play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Clinical remission of scleromyxedema following autologous stem cell transplantation suggests that the bone marrow may be a source of these circulating factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. </p><p>Many authors have also suggested that paraproteins themselves may be pathogenic, acting as autoantibodies that stimulate fibroblasts to proliferate and overproduce mucin. However, data conflict on the relevance of this theory. Although serum isolated from patients with scleromyxedema has enhanced fibroblast proliferation in some in vitro studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], one of these studies also found that purified immunoglobulin from the serum did not stimulate fibroblast growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, a study in which serum from a patient with scleromyxedema was found to increase production of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> (a component of mucin) and prostaglandin E by fibroblast cultures did not find a stimulatory effect of the serum on fibroblast proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Moreover, paraprotein levels usually do not correlate with the severity of disease, disease progression, or the response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Only on anecdotal basis has the complete resolution of skin lesions coincided with the normalization of the bone marrow and the disappearance of the paraprotein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Additional theories on the pathogenesis of scleromyxedema have been proposed. It has been suggested that an intrinsic abnormality of scleromyxedema fibroblasts may result in increased glycosaminoglycan synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, case reports documenting the development of scleromyxedema following a cutaneous granulomatous reaction after intradermal hyaluronic gel injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] or after breast silicone implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] may suggest a type of autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27631293\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of scleromyxedema include both cutaneous and extracutaneous features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27631301\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic skin finding in scleromyxedema is a widespread eruption of 2 to 3 mm, firm, waxy, closely-spaced, dome-shaped or flat-topped papules involving the hands, forearms, head, neck, upper trunk, and thighs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91117%7EDERM%2F91118\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91117 graphicRef91118 \">picture 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Papules are often arranged in a strikingly linear array and the surrounding skin is shiny and indurate (ie, sclerodermoid) in appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91119\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91119 \">picture 2</a>). Rarely, nontender subcutaneous nodules are present. The glabella is typically involved with deep, longitudinal furrows that produce the characteristic leonine face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91120\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91120 \">picture 3</a>). Deep furrowing also is typically evident on the trunk or limbs and is called the &quot;Shar-Pei sign&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91121\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91121 \">picture 4</a>). Erythema, edema, and a brownish discoloration may be seen in the involved areas; pruritus is not uncommon. </p><p>Eyebrow, axillary, and pubic hair may be sparse in patients with scleromyxedema. The mucous membranes are spared. As the condition progresses, erythematous and infiltrated plaques may appear with skin stiffening, sclerodactyly, and decreased motility of the mouth and joints. On the proximal interphalangeal joints, a central depression surrounded by an elevated rim (due to skin thickening) can be seen and is referred to as the &quot;doughnut sign&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91122 \">picture 5</a>). Unlike scleroderma, telangiectasias and calcinosis are absent. However, the Raynaud phenomenon occurs rarely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27631307\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracutaneous manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with scleromyxedema can have a number of internal manifestations, including neurologic, rheumatologic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and renal manifestations of the disease. In a multicenter retrospective study of 30 patients with scleromyxedema, the most common extracutaneous manifestations were neurologic abnormalities (30 percent of patients), rheumatologic abnormalities (25 percent of patients), and cardiac abnormalities (22 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Neurologic complications may involve the peripheral nervous system (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome or peripheral sensory and motor neuropathy) or the central nervous system (eg, memory loss, vertigo, gait problems, stroke, seizures, psychosis, or &quot;dermato-neuro syndrome&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Carpal tunnel syndrome is thought to be due to either deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the carpal tunnel or to a direct toxic effect in the median nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The dermato-neuro syndrome is a rare, and occasionally lethal, acute neurologic complication characterized by fever, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, convulsions, and coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. The dermato-neuro syndrome often is preceded by flu-like symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rheumatologic </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Rheumatologic manifestations are characterized by arthralgias or arthritis of the peripheral joints, especially of the hands, with noninflammatory synovial fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A severe destructive polyarthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis also has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Proximal or generalized weakness due to inflammatory myopathy and fibromyalgia is common and usually occurs several months or years after the onset of skin involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18</a>]. In these patients, muscle biopsy reveals a necrotizing and vacuolar myopathy; interstitial inflammatory infiltrates are found uncommonly and may cause confusion with polymyositis. A few cases of true dermatomyositis have been described in association with scleromyxedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Spontaneous or interferon alfa-induced rhabdomyolysis is an additional rare finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Cardiovascular abnormalities with congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, heart block, and pericardial effusion may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22,23</a>]. Valvular mucin deposition has been described in a case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal </strong>&ndash; Dysphagia is the most common gastrointestinal manifestation and is related to esophageal dysmotility mainly localized to the upper esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Dysphagia is most commonly found in patients with an associated myopathy. Nasal regurgitation may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Dyspnea on exertion is the most common pulmonary finding, due to obstructive or restrictive pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. In addition, hoarseness and aspiration may occur due to laryngeal involvement with decreased epiglottis and vocal cord mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal </strong>&ndash; Involvement of the kidney, characterized by a scleroderma renal crisis-like acute renal failure, is a rare event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ocular </strong>&ndash; Infrequently, corneal opacities and ectropion are seen. </p><p/><p>The pathogenesis of the extracutaneous manifestations of scleromyxedema is unclear. It has been suggested that mucin deposition in various organs may be the cause, although mucin is not consistently found on autopsy in fatal cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In dermato-neuro syndrome, brain autopsy has not been contributory, and the pathogenic basis of the encephalopathy remains obscure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It has been proposed that an increased blood viscosity with impaired microcirculation due to paraproteinemia may result in encephalopathy. A pathogenic role for IgG crossing a damaged blood-brain barrier, mediated by increased IL-6 production, also has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/13,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193080025\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scleromyxedema is associated with paraproteinemia. The monoclonal gammopathy is usually IgG with a predominance of lambda light chains, but a predominance of IgG kappa also may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,26</a>]. Less frequently, a different paraproteinemia is detected. In a retrospective study of 26 patients with scleromyxedema evaluated at a single academic center between 1966 and 1990; alternative paraproteinemias were detected in three patients (IgM-kappa, IgA-kappa, or IgA-lambda) and three additional patients did not have evidence of a paraproteinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients with scleromyxedema in the absence of paraproteinemia are considered to have an atypical form of the disease. </p><p>A mild plasmacytosis may be found in the bone marrow of patients with scleromyxedema. However, the disease is estimated to progress to multiple myeloma in less than 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Anecdotal associations with hematologic malignancies (such as Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia, and myelomonocytic leukemia) or visceral carcinomas have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33-35</a>]; however, no clear association with any specific non-iatrogenic neoplasm has been identified. Most malignancies in these patients are iatrogenic and associated with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27631313\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scleromyxedema follows a chronic, progressive, and sometimes unpredictable course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Depending on the rapidity of onset and the degree of involvement, patients may be either initially asymptomatic or may notice that skin becomes thick and hard, and that the face shows a diffuse induration and coarsening in the forehead lines and in lateral portions of the chin. As the disease progresses (usually over the course of years and occasionally over the course of several months), a diffuse sclerodermoid induration with overlying papules, sclerodactyly, and decreased motility of the mouth and joints occurs. Our experience suggests that spontaneous resolution does not occur; however, at least one case of apparent spontaneous resolution has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Systemic consequences of scleromyxedema may result in death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>]. In a case series in which follow-up was available for 21 patients with scleromyxedema (mean follow-up time 33.5 months, range 2 months to 11 years), at the end of follow-up, five patients (23.8 percent) died, whereas 12 patients were alive with disease and four patients were alive without disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Death was caused by extracutaneous complications of scleromyxedema including dermato-neuro syndrome (2 patients) and myocardial insufficiency due to endocardial mucin deposition (1 patient) or by an associated myeloid leukemia (1 patient) or Hodgkin lymphoma (1 patient). Death also may occur as a side effect of treatment. In particular, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> has been associated with death from complications of sepsis and hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27631339\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scleromyxedema is characterized by a triad of microscopic features that includes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91123%7EDERM%2F91124\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91123 graphicRef91124 \">picture 6A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diffuse deposit of mucin composed primarily of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> in the upper and mid-reticular dermis; the presence of mucin can be confirmed with an Alcian blue stain (pH 2.5) or a colloidal iron stain and hyaluronidase digestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91125\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91125 \">picture 7</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in collagen deposition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A marked proliferation of irregularly arranged fibroblasts</p><p/><p>The epidermis may be normal or thinned by the presence of the underlying mucin and fibrosis; the hair follicles may be atrophic; and a slight perivascular, superficial, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate is often present.

The presence of diffuse, waxy papules in linear arrays and in a characteristic distribution that includes the glabella and posterior auricular area, the involvement of the middle portion of the back (always spared in scleroderma), and the presence of an IgG monoclonal gammopathy all favor a diagnosis of scleromyxedema.

The histologic findings of scleromyxedema and scleredema differ; the fibroblast proliferation that is evident in histologic specimens of scleromyxedema is absent in scleredema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

In the past, the terms &quot;papular mucinosis,&quot; &quot;lichen myxedematosus,&quot; and &quot;scleromyxedema&quot; were often used indiscriminately. Although scleromyxedema and the localized type of lichen myxedematosus, including subtypes such as acral persistent papular mucinosis, discrete lichen myxedematosus, papular mucinosis of infancy, and nodular lichen myxedematosus, belong to the same disease spectrum, it is important to make a distinction between the two disorders because of differences in prognosis and the approach to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Historically, most patients reported in the literature to have lichen myxedematosus or papular mucinosis without specification of the disease subtype appear to have had scleromyxedema with monoclonal gammopathy. Occasionally, patients have overlapping or atypical features and fall in between scleromyxedema and localized lichen myxedematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27631369\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A paucity of high quality studies on the efficacy of treatments for scleromyxedema and an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of the disorder have prevented the development of definitive guidelines on the best approach to treatment. No randomized trials have evaluated therapies for scleromyxedema and data are primarily limited to case reports and case series due to rarity of the disease. No specific treatment appears to be uniformly effective and the relative efficacies of the treatments that have been utilized remain unclear. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27951139\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a consequence of the limited data on therapies for scleromyxedema, opinions vary on the preferred approach to treatment.

Consideration of patient characteristics, patient preferences, clinician experience, and treatment accessibility may support other approaches to treatment. </p><p>In all cases, the risk-benefit ratio of treatment is an important consideration for selecting an appropriate therapeutic regimen. Although scleromyxedema can progress to a life-threatening disorder, some of the treatments used for the disease also may induce life-threatening side effects.</p><p>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is our first-line systemic therapy based upon multiple case reports and case series that support its efficacy and the generally well-tolerated nature of this non-immunosuppressive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. For those patients who cannot receive IVIG, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> and systemic glucocorticoids are our preferred initial systemic therapies because with careful monitoring, these treatments also are well tolerated by most patients. When a response to IVIG is incomplete or relapse occurs upon tapering, we often combine IVIG and thalidomide or systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Long-term remissions with IVIG therapy may occur; however, most patients require continued treatment to remain in remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/26,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,50</a>].</p><p>Our patients with severe disease who cannot be successfully managed with IVIG, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic glucocorticoids are candidates for trials of more aggressive interventions, such as autologous bone marrow transplantation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. In the past, melphalan, a chemotherapeutic agent given with the intent to treat the associated plasma cell dyscrasia, was often considered first-line treatment for scleromyxedema. Although the drug can be effective, concerns regarding the serious adverse effects of melphalan, including hematologic malignancies and opportunistic infections, contributed to a desire for other, less toxic first-line therapies for scleromyxedema. </p><p>Although monoclonal gammopathy accompanies most cases of scleromyxedema, successful treatment of scleromyxedema does not appear to require the resolution of the paraproteinemia. The management of monoclonal gammopathy is reviewed in detail separately.

For most of these patients, our first choice for therapy is IVIG. Our selection of IVIG is based upon case reports and case series documenting improvement in the cutaneous and extracutaneous signs and symptoms of scleromyxedema during IVIG therapy and the generally favorable tolerability of this agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,52</a>].

Even when therapy is successful, long-term maintenance therapy usually is required since relapse commonly occurs upon the discontinuation of treatment. Death may result from complications of extracutaneous involvement or adverse effects of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H27631313\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p>Because of the various cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations of scleromyxedema, a multispecialty team often is needed for the optimal management of these patients. Depending on the manifestations present, dermatologists, hematologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, hand surgeons, and other specialists can be valuable for managing affected patients. </p><p>The unpredictable course of scleromyxedema, the variable response to treatment, and the common occurrence of relapse demand close, long-term follow-up of these patients. We usually reassess patients once per month with a full skin examination, review of systems, and reevaluation of the therapeutic regimen. Serologic studies, including assessment of the status of the associated monoclonal gammopathy, are not useful for monitoring disease activity.</p><p>Patients should be cautioned that development of neurologic symptoms (eg, dysarthria) and flu-like illness may be the initial signs of dermato-neuro syndrome. Patients with such symptoms should be admitted to the hospital for close observation and evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193081465\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scleromyxedema is an uncommon generalized papular and cutaneous eruption that usually occurs in association with monoclonal gammopathy and may have accompanying systemic features. The disorder typically affects adults. There is no sex predilection. The pathogenesis of scleromyxedema is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H27631281\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27631287\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H193080025\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cutaneous manifestations of scleromyxedema consist of widespread waxy papules and indurated plaques. Progressive cutaneous involvement can lead to decreased motility of the mouth and joints. Extracutaneous involvement in scleromyxedema can present with a variety of manifestations. Neurologic, musculoskeletal, cardiac, gastrointestinal, respiratory, or renal abnormalities may develop. (See <a href=\"#H27631293\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of scleromyxedema is chronic and progressive. Cutaneous and extracutaneous involvement can lead to significant morbidity. Death may result from complications related to extracutaneous involvement or adverse effects of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H27631313\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of scleromyxedema is based upon recognition of consistent clinical, pathologic, and laboratory findings. The presence of the following features is supportive of the diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H256448316\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Generalized papular and sclerodermoid eruption</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Microscopic triad, including mucin deposition, fibrosis, and fibroblast proliferation, or rarely an interstitial granulomatous-like pattern</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Monoclonal gammopathy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absence of thyroid disorder</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a paucity of data on the treatment options for scleromyxedema. The available data consist primarily of case reports and case series. Thus, there are no definitive guidelines on the best approach to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H27631369\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with scleromyxedema generally require systemic therapy. We suggest intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thalidomide</a> and systemic glucocorticoids are alternative treatment options that may also be used in conjunction with IVIG therapy. (See <a href=\"#H27631369\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who fail to respond to IVIG, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, or systemic glucocorticoids may benefit from other therapies. Examples of treatment options for severe and refractory disease include autologous stem cell transplantation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. The risk-benefit ratios of treatment must be carefully considered prior to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H188062601\" class=\"local\">'Severe and refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrence of scleromyxedema is common after withdrawal of an effective therapy. Long-term maintenance treatment usually is required and close clinical follow-up is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H193081404\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and follow-up'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scleromyxedema/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rongioletti F, Merlo G, Cinotti E, et al.
