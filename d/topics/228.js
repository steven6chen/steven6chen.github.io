It may lie in the upper abdomen or on the left side in children with congenital abnormalities of intestinal position (eg, uncorrected malrotation), situs inversus totalis, and after repair of diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, and omphalocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Some anatomic features of the appendix may play a role in the incidence and presentation of appendicitis throughout childhood. These include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first year of life, the appendix is funnel-shaped, perhaps making it less likely to become obstructed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoid follicles are interspersed in the colonic epithelium that lines the appendix and may obstruct it. These follicles reach their maximal size during adolescence, the age group in which the peak incidence of appendicitis occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The omentum is underdeveloped in young children and often cannot contain purulent material, perhaps accounting, in part, for the diffuse peritonitis that typically follows perforation in young children.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most commonly, appendicitis is caused by nonspecific obstruction of the appendiceal lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Fecal material, undigested food, other foreign material, an enlarged lymphoid follicle in the epithelial lining, or a bend or twist of the organ itself may all be responsible. The obstruction causes colic, which in turn produces the poorly localized periumbilical abdominal pain typical of early appendicitis. It also causes the appendiceal lumen to dilate and its wall to thicken.</p><p>Intraluminal bacterial overgrowth follows appendiceal obstruction with breakdown of the mucosal barrier, bacterial invasion of the wall, inflammation, ischemia, and gangrene, eventually leading to perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The bacteria include the usual fecal flora, mainly aerobic and anaerobic Gram negative rods. The most common are <em>Escherichia coli</em>, Peptostreptococcus species, <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em>, and Pseudomonas species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Inflammation of the wall of the appendix causes peritonitis, which produces localized abdominal pain and tenderness, the cardinal clinical signs of acute appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Perforation releases bacteria into the peritoneal cavity. Perforation occurs rarely in the first 12 hours of symptoms but is more likely with time thereafter, becoming common after 72 hours. Generalized peritonitis develops if the infection is not contained by bowel loops and omentum.</p><p>Less commonly, enteric pathogens may directly infect the appendix or cause localized appendiceal lymphoid hyperplasia with obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Specific organisms include adenovirus (in combination with intussusception) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], rubeola virus (measles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], Epstein-Barr virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], <em>Actinomyces israeli</em> (Actinomycosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], <em>Enterobius vermicularis</em> (pinworms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and <em>Ascaris lumbricoides </em>(roundworms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Rarely, pediatric appendicitis arises from other conditions such as Crohn's disease (granulomatous inflammation of the appendix) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], appendiceal carcinoid tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], Burkitt lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], appendiceal duplication (often in association with other duplications of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract in children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], or cystic fibrosis (inspissated mucous obstruction of the appendiceal lumen).

The incidence increases from an annual rate of one to six per 10,000 children between birth and four years of age to 19 to 28 per 10,000 children younger than 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. It presents most frequently in the second decade of life. Fewer than 5 percent of patients diagnosed with appendicitis are five years of age or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Boys are more commonly affected than girls (lifetime risk 9 and 7 percent, respectively).</p><p>Advanced disease is common in children younger than six years of age, occurring in up to 57 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This finding is explained by the frequency of nonspecific symptoms in young children with appendicitis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>Traditionally, success in achieving the goal of timely and accurate diagnosis for appendicitis has been reflected, in part, by the balance between perforation rates and rates of negative appendectomy. Perforation correlates strongly with duration of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In addition, as with adults, their accuracy has not been well defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,33</a>]. The absence of the classic signs of appendicitis should not cause the clinician to exclude the diagnosis of appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, when present in children 3 to 12 years of age, these signs have high specificity for acute appendicitis (86 to 98 percent, depending upon age).</p><p>Although this classic pattern of clinical findings does occur in school-age children and adolescents, it is less common overall in pediatric patients with appendicitis than in adults. (See <a href=\"#H599831244\" class=\"local\">'School-age (5 to 12 years)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H599831291\" class=\"local\">'Adolescent'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis#H5345945\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>In infants and young children, this pattern may not occur at all, perhaps because of differences in the pathophysiology of the disease and in the child's ability to relate information regarding signs and symptoms.

This was demonstrated in a prospective series describing children evaluated in an emergency department (ED) for suspected appendicitis in whom the following features were noted among the patients with appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of migration of pain to right lower quadrant in 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of anorexia in 40 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No rebound tenderness in 52 percent</p><p/><p>Thus, diagnosing appendicitis among children is frequently challenging because typical symptoms and signs are often not present, specific findings of appendicitis are difficult to elicit in this patient population, and clinical findings frequently overlap with other conditions.

A reliable examination requires that the child be quiet and cooperative. To accomplish this, the clinician needs to gain the trust of the child which often requires significant patience. It is also helpful to spend time taking the history, sitting down if possible, and to examine the abdomen before more invasive portions of the examination, such as looking in the ears or pharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similarly, the child can be initially examined in the position in which he or she is most comfortable, such as a caretaker's lap, prior to a standard evaluation.</p><p>In some patients, the degree of pain makes physical examination of the abdomen challenging. We recommend that children with suspected appendicitis receive analgesia commensurate with the degree of pain, including intravenous opioid medications if necessary. In the past, analgesia for patients with appendicitis was discouraged in the mistaken belief that pain control would mask symptoms and cause clinicians to miss definitive signs of disease. However, trials in children indicate that diagnosis of appendicitis is not significantly impacted when they receive intravenous opioid medications for pain control as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial performed in 108 children (age 5 to 16 years) with suspected appendicitis who received intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> or normal saline while undergoing evaluation in a children's hospital ED, morphine administrations was <strong>not</strong> associated with perforation, negative appendectomy, or admission for observation after surgical assessment when compared to intravenous normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Approximately three-quarters of patients in both groups underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy with appendicitis diagnosed in 29 patients in both groups. Morphine administration was not associated with increased risk of perforation. Appendicitis was missed in one patient who received normal saline. However, morphine in a dose of 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> did <strong>not</strong> decrease pain more than placebo in this study.</p><p/><p>Although both of these studies may not have had enough patients to truly identify significant differences in the impact of analgesia on the diagnosis of appendicitis, neither trial detected significant adverse effects on surgical management of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, they support prompt treatment of abdominal pain in school-aged children and older with suspected appendicitis.</p><p>No studies have evaluated the use of analgesia in patients younger than five years of age undergoing examination for appendicitis.

Furthermore, in one observational study, the diagnostic accuracy for appendicitis in 33 children undergoing digital rectal examination was not different from 64 children in whom it was omitted (75 versus 90 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Thus, digital rectal examination is <strong>not</strong> necessary in most children with suspected appendicitis and typically does <strong>not</strong> need to be performed to make the diagnosis of appendicitis.

As an example, in a single-center, prospective observational study of 185 children presenting to the ED with abdominal pain (prevalence of appendicitis 48 percent), a PCT &lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and CP &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (expressed as a negative commercial fluoroimmunoassay result), when combined with ANC &lt;7500 was able to identify children without appendicitis with 100 percent sensitivity (95% CI 96 to 100 percent) and a negative predictive value of 100 percent (95% CI 90 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, further study in larger and more diverse populations is needed before PCT and CP can be routinely recommended in the laboratory evaluation of pediatric appendicitis.</p><p>Laboratory tests should <strong>not</strong> be used in isolation to make or exclude the diagnosis of appendicitis. However, in some children, a combination of characteristic clinical findings and elevations in WBC, ANC, or CRP is sufficient to diagnose appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Based upon observational studies, up to 50 percent of children with appendicitis can undergo surgery using clinical and laboratory findings and avoid diagnostic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H6659516\" class=\"local\">'Clinical scoring systems'</a> below.)</p><p>Elevations in the peripheral WBC count, ANC, and CRP levels have been noted in children with appendicitis. However, these findings are variable and nonspecific as indicated by the following evidence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>WBC and ANC </strong>&ndash; Either the WBC or the ANC is elevated in up to 96 percent of children with appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This finding, however, is nonspecific because many other diseases that mimic appendicitis (eg, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease, or gastroenteritis) also cause such elevations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,37,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37,52,53</a>]. Thus, the ability of these tests to discriminate appendicitis from other causes is limited. As an example, in an observational study of 280 children (age 3 to 18 years) evaluated for appendicitis who had symptoms less than 24 hours, a WBC <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;14,600/mm<sup>3</sup></span> and an ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;11,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> had sensitivities of 68 and 69 percent, respectively and specificities of 96 and 75 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In another observational report describing 772 children (1 to 19 years of age) with nontraumatic abdominal pain who were evaluated in an ED, those patients with either increased WBC (greater than upper limit of normal for age) or elevated neutrophil count (&gt;80 percent mature or immature neutrophils), had an overall sensitivity of 79 percent and specificity of 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, in children undergoing appendectomy, a normal WBC or ANC prior to surgery is associated with a negative appendectomy. As an example, in a retrospective observational study of 847 children who underwent appendectomy, a WBC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;9000/microliter</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;8000/microliter</span> prior to surgery had sensitivities of 92 and 95 percent, respectively for a normal appendix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CRP</strong> &ndash; Elevation of CRP (&gt;0.6 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L])</span> has been reported in children with appendicitis, but sensitivities and specificities range widely (sensitivity 58 to 93 percent, specificity 28 to 82 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,37,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37,54</a>]. CRP appears to be less sensitive in patients who have had symptoms for less than 24 hours but more sensitive than WBC for patients with symptoms for 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/54,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,57</a>]. Small observational studies also suggest that an elevated CRP may be more helpful in identifying both a gangrenous appendix (&gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L]</span> in 83 percent of patients) and appendiceal perforation (sensitivity and specificity for perforation 76 and 82 percent, respectively at a CRP &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. When both CRP and WBC are elevated, specificity for appendicitis is approximately 90 percent, although sensitivity remains low at approximately 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Procalcitonin </strong>&ndash; In one prospective study of 209 children (1 to 18 years of age), semiquantitative procalcitonin levels (PCT) were higher in patients with definitive appendicitis than in those without definitive appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, either WBC or CRP was better able to identify patients with appendicitis than PCT.

The diagnosis may be straightforward when the classic findings associated with appendicitis are present. However, the variations in presentation by age and sex can pose a significant challenge. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H599831092\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features by age'</a> above.) </p><p>In some children with abdominal pain a clear alternative diagnosis is present (eg, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease). These patients should receive specific treatment for the underlying condition rather than undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for appendicitis. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>For patients without a clear etiology for their abdominal pain in whom appendicitis is suspected, we suggest a diagnostic approach guided by the clinical impression of risk (low, moderate, or high) derived from history, physical examination, and selected laboratory studies as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96236\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96236 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low risk</strong> &ndash; These patients have few signs or symptoms of appendicitis (eg, afebrile, no history of vomiting or anorexia, minimal diffuse abdominal tenderness with a soft abdomen on palpation, or no right lower quadrant tenderness). If obtained, white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are typically normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, patients can be determined to be low risk by a Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) &le;2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62136 \">table 1</a>) or according to the refined Low-Risk Appendicitis Rule (ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;6750/mm<sup>3</sup></span> AND either maximal abdominal tenderness <strong>not</strong> in the right lower quadrant or right lower quadrant tenderness but no abdominal pain with walking, jumping, or coughing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>].

However, the risk of appendicitis in these patients is low enough to make close follow-up the most appropriate approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Children <strong>without</strong> right lower quadrant pain or tenderness may be discharged home with clear instructions to the caregivers to return if pain increases or becomes localized to the right lower quadrant. The clinician should ensure that the caregivers are reliable and understand that a specific diagnosis for their child's abdominal pain has not been made and appendicitis is still possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Patients <strong>with</strong> right lower quadrant pain or tenderness should undergo assured reevaluation within 12 to 24 hours.

Diagnostic imaging is usually warranted to supplement other clinical findings in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6659516\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical scoring systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinical scoring systems have been devised for the diagnosis of appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among these, the Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62136 \">table 1</a>), the refined Low-Risk Appendicitis Score, the Alvarado (or MANTRELS) score, and the Pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC) have been prospectively studied in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,64-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,64-68</a>]. The utility of these scores lies in their ability to categorize patients into groups that are at low, moderate, and high risk of appendicitis. However, they have limited ability to identify patients who warrant appendectomy. Furthermore, no studies have evaluated the ability of such scoring systems to improve diagnostic outcomes (ie, reduction in perforation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> negative appendectomy rate) when compared to assessment by experienced clinicians. Nevertheless, these scores may have utility in identifying children who may benefit from diagnostic imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical consultation by providing a standard approach. The specific components of these scores are provided below. </p><p>Interobserver reliability of historical and physical examination findings commonly used in these scores shows significant variation. As an example, in a prospective multicenter study of 811 children (age 3 to 18 years) with possible appendicitis who underwent independent evaluations by clinicians with variable experience and training, agreement beyond chance for items commonly used in clinical scores was high only for the history of emesis and was moderate for the following clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorexia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of right lower quadrant pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migration of pain to the right lower quadrant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximal tenderness in the right lower quadrant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain with walking, jumping, or coughing</p><p/><p>These findings may, in part, explain why diagnostic accuracy for clinical scoring systems can be inconsistent.</p><p>Limited evidence is available to determine which score is best. In one systematic review of 11 prospective studies that evaluated the use of the PAS in 2170 children and the Alvarado score in 1589 children, the Alvarado score appeared to be better than the PAS for identifying children at low risk for appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Patients with volvulus often have pain out of proportion to physical examination findings. In patients with signs of obstruction, plain abdominal radiographs should be performed to exclude signs of perforation. The diagnosis of malrotation is confirmed by a limited upper gastrointestinal series or computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with intravenous contrast. Prompt surgical intervention is required in patients with volvulus.

In the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for establishing the diagnosis of intussusception approach 100 percent. The diagnosis can also be made with a contrast enema (air or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a>), which may reduce the intussusceptum, thereby avoiding an operation.

Features include acute onset of moderate to severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and an adnexal mass. The character of the pain may be sharp, stabbing, colicky, or crampy, and may radiate to the flank, back, or groin. Infants with ovarian torsion present with feeding intolerance, vomiting, abdominal distension, and fussiness or irritability. Most infants have previously diagnosed ovarian cysts on prenatal ultrasounds. Salvage of the ovary is often not possible but is maximized by expeditious surgery. Ovarian torsion is typically diagnosed with Doppler flow ultrasound of the ovaries.

In many children, pneumonia can be diagnosed based upon clinical findings alone. The presence of infiltrates on chest radiograph, which may be subtle on presentation, confirms the diagnosis of pneumonia in children with compatible clinical findings. However, pneumonia can be difficult to identify when respiratory signs and symptoms are subtle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Because of the overlap in clinical presentation, some children may warrant chest radiographs and abdominal imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Community-acquired pneumonia in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age&quot;, section on 'Pneumonia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Community-acquired pneumonia in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urinary tract infection</strong> &ndash; UTIs may cause abdominal pain and vomiting, particularly in young children. Although white blood cells (WBCs) may also be seen on urinalysis in patients with appendicitis, children with UTIs will generally have bacteria on microscopic examination and a dipstick positive for leukocyte esterase <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nitrites.

Suggestive clinical findings include sore throat, tender anterior cervical nodes, and exudative pharyngitis. Rapid antigen detection can quickly diagnose group A streptococcal disease in most cases.

In resource-rich countries, a viral etiology is most common, and the presence and quantity of diarrhea can be variable. Diarrhea may also occur in children with appendicitis, especially patients younger than five years of age. In most instances, children with gastroenteritis have diffuse abdominal tenderness without guarding or rebound. The diagnosis of gastroenteritis should be made cautiously in children with abdominal pain and vomiting who do not have diarrhea. In one retrospective review of cases of missed appendicitis, 42 percent of children were initially diagnosed with gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

This radiologic finding is a nonspecific indicator of infection, inflammation, and rarely, malignancy. Etiologies of mesenteric lymphadenitis include viral and bacterial gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compared to patients with acute appendicitis, children with mesenteric adenitis tend to have longer duration of symptoms prior to presentation, fewer findings of appendicitis (ie, vomiting, migration of pain, percussion tenderness, rebound tenderness, or Rovsing sign), higher fever (when present), and normal WBC counts and C-reactive protein levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, patients with mesenteric adenitis can have clinical findings that are difficult to distinguish from acute appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].
