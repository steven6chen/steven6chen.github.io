Elemental mercury is vapor at room temperature, and the major route of absorption is through the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Elemental mercury is poorly absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract or skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

This technique was commonly utilized during the California gold rush and is still used by over 16 million artisanal gold miners worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It has been estimated that approximately 500,000 gold miners in Brazil use liquid mercury to concentrate gold from sediments. The use of mercury for this purpose may cause considerable environmental contamination and is toxic to miners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Amalgam, or dental silver, is an alloy of 50 percent metallic mercury and 50 percent metal powder (which is usually composed of silver, tin, copper, and zinc in certain proportions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A small amount of elemental mercury is released from amalgam fillings. The magnitude of release is proportional to the number of fillings and the total amalgam surface area.

An expert committee from the World Health Organization believes that the average exposure from dental amalgam is approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day,</span> well below toxic levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The occupational threshold limit value (TLV) has been lowered to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> or less in most countries. The Federal OSHA in the United States has set a mercury PEL of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> (eight-hour time-weighted average [TWA]), but some state OSHA programs regulate a stricter limit at 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> (eight-hour TWA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Measurements of mercury in blood and urine are useful in quantifying the degree of exposure.

Two cases of membranous nephropathy were reported from a fluorescent-tube recycling industry in Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Heavy occupational exposure to mercury was evident from markedly elevated urinary excretion of mercury (118 and 158 mcg <span class=\"nowrap\">Hg/L,</span> respectively). Two years after withdrawal from exposure to mercury, urinary excretion of mercury and protein was almost normal in one patient.

Acrodynia is characterized by a body rash, extremity edema, and irritation of palms and soles, followed by skin desquamation, irritability, photophobia, fever, insomnia, and profuse sweating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/33,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,38,39</a>].</p><p>Acrodynia was common among infants in the United Kingdom and the United States until the late 1940s, when it was realized that the condition was primarily caused by exposure to calomel (mercurous chloride, an inorganic mercury salt) in teething powders and in anthelminthic preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thought to be a hypersensitivity reaction to mercury influenced by a highly variable individual susceptibility, acrodynia affected almost exclusively infants and small children. The syndrome develops in only a small proportion of those who are exposed (&lt;1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3541308736\"><span class=\"h3\">Tubular dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occupational exposure to both elemental mercury vapor and inorganic mercury has been associated with subtle abnormalities in kidney tubular function. One study found a slightly higher prevalence of elevated urinary excretion of albumin, transferrin, retinol-binding protein, and the tubular enzyme, beta-galactosidase, in chloralkali workers with a urinary excretion of mercury exceeding 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>These changes presumably reflected tubular injury, leading to the excretion of smaller proteins that are normally filtered and then largely reabsorbed.

In a thorough cross-sectional examination of chloralkali workers exposed to mercury at air concentrations of approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup>,</span> a significant correlation and dose-response relationship were observed between the urinary excretion of mercury and NAG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. No significant differences were observed between exposed and control patients with respect to other renal parameters, including urinary excretion of albumin, orosomucoid, beta2-microglobulin, or copper, or in the serum creatinine concentration.</p><p>The more subtle, tubular effects from mercury may be reversible. As an example, nephrotoxicity was not observed after extensive examination among workers who were exposed to relatively low levels of mercury an average of six years prior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1252387243\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of elemental mercury toxicity should be suspected among individuals who present with consistent clinical manifestations and who have a history of exposure risk via occupation or other activities such as smelting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mercury-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring mercury in blood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 24-hour urine.

Whole-blood mercury should be measured in the unstable patient who has suspected acute toxicity. However, 24-hour urine mercury measurement is the preferred test to assess toxicity in patients who have suspected stable and chronic exposure to elemental mercury. While whole-blood mercury concentrations can reflect very large acute mercury exposure, this test becomes less reliable as redistribution to tissues takes place, making 24-hour urine testing more reliable in stable, chronic, or low-grade mercury exposures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3721913315\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with toxicity from elemental mercury should be immediately removed from the source of mercury exposure.

For patients with suspected chronic mercury exposure, 24-hour urine mercury is used to determine if chelation is indicated. For unstable patients with acute, severe toxicity, rapid assessment for mercury toxicity can be performed using blood mercury testing as rapid testing will facilitate early chelation.
