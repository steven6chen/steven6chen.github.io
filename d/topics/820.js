The innate immune system constitutes the first-line barrier, the rapid-response mechanism, to prevent microbial invasion. Its components are inherited from parent to child and directed against molecules expressed only by micro-organisms. These host defense components are evolutionarily ancient, found in all multicellular organisms, and expressed in humans as conserved elements (homologs) shared with other vertebrates and in some form, with insects and plants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the cells, proteins, and receptors that comprise the innate immune system, the functional differences between innate and acquired immune responses, and the mechanisms by which the two systems interact. Disorders of innate immunity and more specific topics on individual types of cells and receptors are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannose-binding-lectin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mannose-binding lectin&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4039235\"><span class=\"h1\">INNATE VERSUS ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Innate&quot; immunity refers to immune responses that are present from birth and not learned, adapted, or permanently heightened as a result of exposure to micro-organisms, in contrast to the responses of T and B lymphocytes in the adaptive immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The importance of innate immunity can be appreciated by considering that the generation time of most bacteria is 20 to 30 minutes, whereas the development of a specific adaptive immune response with antibody and T cells takes days to weeks. The innate immune system protects the host during the time between microbe exposure and initial adaptive responses.</p><p>The mechanisms by which the innate and adaptive (acquired) immune systems function are fundamentally different:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The innate immune system recognizes microbes through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are receptors specific for molecular components of micro-organisms that are not made by the host. Some innate immune responses are temporarily upregulated as a result of exposure to microbes, but the components of the innate immune system do not change permanently during an individual's lifetime. However, phylogenetic studies have indicated that genes for PRRs and other components have been gradually modified over generations by natural selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, adaptive immune responses are continually refined and adjusted throughout the lifetime of the host. Each T and B lymphocyte acquires a structurally unique receptor during development, yielding a vast repertoire of individualized receptors. From this repertoire, cells exposed to microbial or other antigens expand as a clone of cells directed at their specific antigen. As the clone expands, the tightness (affinity) of the binding and the specificity for its particular antigen both increase. Thus, the most useful receptors are selected and improved in the host over time. However, the &quot;learned&quot; immune responses and refinements made to the adaptive system cannot be passed on to an individual's progeny.

The body's microbial composition directly effects the maturation of the immune response and its continued effectiveness, protects against pathogen overgrowth, and modulates the balance between inflammation and immune homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/15,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18-20</a>]. As examples, coagulase-negative staphylococci on the skin produce an antimicrobial peptide that can inhibit growth of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. These protective strains are deficient in atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Alteration in the composition, diversity, or metabolites of the microbiome (ie, dysbiosis), such as that caused by antibiotic use, is associated with diseases affecting a variety of organ systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/15-17,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17,22-26</a>]. Dysbiosis is also believed to play a role in development of food allergy, asthma, and atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/16,20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20,27</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9420986\" class=\"local\">'Microbial detection through pattern recognition'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulation of inflammation &ndash; The cardinal signs of inflammation (tumor, rubor, calor, and dolor [swelling, redness, heat, and pain]) are products of the protective action of innate immunity. To limit damage to the host, these responses must also be terminated when no longer needed.

These proteins are grouped in their broad biologic context as &quot;pattern recognition receptors&quot; (PRRs) to emphasize their common function in host defense. The molecular components of micro-organisms recognized by PRRs are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4044317\"><span class=\"h2\">Pattern recognition receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can be divided into two broad groups: Secreted and circulating proteins and peptides and transmembrane and intracellular signal-transducing receptors (receptors in the more traditional sense). Some of the best studied molecules are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4044324\"><span class=\"h3\">Secreted and circulating pattern recognition receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secreted and circulating pattern recognition molecules include antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), collectins, lectins, and pentraxins. These proteins and peptides mediate direct microbial killing, act as helper proteins for transmembrane receptors, and function as enhancers of phagocytosis (opsonins) by immune effector cells. The first component of complement, C1q, is a circulating and cell-associated pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that plays a broad role in host protection. It triggers the complement cascade upon binding to antibody that is fixed to a microbe. The resulting attachment of C3b promotes phagocytosis of (ie, opsonizes) the microbe. (See <a href=\"#H9421023\" class=\"local\">'Collectins'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9421016\"><span class=\"h4\">Antimicrobial peptides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a group of secreted pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are important in the protection of the skin and mucosal membranes and in the killing of phagocytosed organisms. AMPs secreted onto epithelial surfaces at a site of injury create a microbicidal shield that damages micro-organisms prior to attachment and invasion. They are microbicidal against a broad range of bacteria, fungi, chlamydiae, parasites, and enveloped viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/29-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-42</a>].</p><p>Petrolatum, commonly used in the management of atopic dermatitis, increases the concentration of AMPs in occluded skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A database of over 1200 AMPs published in 2009 links amino acid composition to activity against specific types of micro-organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>AMPs form pores through the outer membranes of a microbe that disrupt the membrane integrity and lead to death of the microbe. AMPs exist in many different forms and structures but all contain clusters of hydrophobic, cationic (positively-charged) amino acids that bind to negatively-charged phospholipids in the outer bilayer of bacterial membranes. The outer cell membranes of animals contain lipids (including cholesterol) that differ from those of microbes, and AMPs are not attracted to them.</p><p>Prototypic secreted and circulating PRRs include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F53389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53389 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defensins, which are divided into alpha- and beta-defensins:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Human alpha-defensins 1 to 4 (HDs 1 to 4) are contained in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and are also synthesized by Paneth cells at the base of small intestinal crypts (alpha-defensins 5 and 6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/31,33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33,35</a>]. Defensins are short peptides (30 to 45 amino acids) that have three disulfide bonds that protect the peptide from protease degradation. They comprise 2 to 4 percent of the neutrophil cellular protein and are released into the phagocytic vacuole with captured organisms. HD5 kills microbes directly. HD6 does not kill directly but forms microscopic net-like meshworks (nanonets) that entrap the microbial cells, as do the extracellular traps that are released from dying neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Human beta-defensins 1 to 6 (HBDs 1 to 6) are expressed on all epithelial surfaces, including those of the airways, urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, mouth, cornea and conjunctivae, and skin. Their production by epithelial cells can be constitutive (baseline, unstimulated) or inducible. Infectious or traumatic injury of epithelium elicits inflammatory cytokines that induce beta-defensin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/31,39,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,39,44</a>]. Deficiency of HBD1 in sperm is associated with male infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cathelicidins are a family of AMPs widely distributed in nature. The human cathelicidin LL-37, the most widely studied, is released from both neutrophils and epithelial cells. It exhibits a broad range of antimicrobial activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34</a>], neutralizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and plays a role in wound healing, angiogenesis, and clearance of dead cells. LL-37 is induced by vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. In both keratinocytes and macrophages, stimulation of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) results in the induction of the cytochrome P450 enzyme that converts vitamin D to its active form, which in turn induces the expression of LL-37. In this way, vitamin D can influence microbicidal defenses of both skin and circulating phagocytic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This may explain, at least in part, why certain human infections (eg, tuberculosis) are more prevalent among populations with inadequate plasma levels of vitamin D, including those with more deeply pigmented skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

It selectively damages membranes of gram-negative bacteria and can opsonize the bacteria for phagocytosis by neutrophils. It has a high affinity for the lipid A region of LPS, which gives it the capacity to downregulate the effects of LPS on inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelial and innate immune cells express multiple AMPs from several different structural classes across the body.

However, a second major function of these peptides is to govern the composition of the commensal micro-organisms that colonize our body surfaces. These species, which lack the attributes of major pathogens, can be relatively resistant to AMPs and thus may have had an evolutionary advantage over other microbes in adapting to this niche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/29,32,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32,57,58</a>]. In fact, human gut microbes from all dominant species can resist even the high levels of AMPs secreted in response to inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Inherited variability in defensin gene expression has been reported to contribute to the risk of several diseases, including Crohn disease and psoriasis, and research suggests that AMPs play a part in the pathophysiology of other diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and necrotizing enterocolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Neutrophils and saliva in children with Kostmann severe congenital neutropenia are deficient in defensins and LL-37. These children suffer life-threatening infections and severe periodontal disease. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration corrects the neutropenia but not the periodontitis. Bone marrow transplantation restores salivary LL-37 and allows control of the periodontal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Collectins are collagen-like proteins that bind to carbohydrate or lipid moieties in microbial cell walls. They can have direct microbicidal activity or flag the microbial cell for recognition by the complement system and phagocytosis. They can promote uptake of cells that have undergone apoptosis (cell death without cell disintegration), particularly neutrophils, to avoid release of tissue-toxic constituents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/61-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-66</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first component of complement, the collectin C1q, is a circulating and cell-associated PRR. It fixes to antibody-coated micro-organisms, some unopsonized organisms, immune complexes, apoptotic cells, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to initiate the complement cascade and clearance of the organism or particle. It plays a fundamental role in host defense and in preventing autoimmune disease, as demonstrated by the increased frequency of infections and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in individuals who lack C1q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

It is recognized that complement activation is not confined to the extracellular space but also occurs within cells to promote cell homeostasis. Proteolytic cleavage of intracellular C3 and C5 releases C3a and C5a, which can react with cell surface C3a and C5a &quot;anaphylatoxin&quot; receptors in autocrine fashion or these <span class=\"nowrap\">C3/C5</span> byproducts can bind to their receptors within the cell.

Thus, efferocytosis is central to the successful resolution of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/256,260,261\" class=\"abstract_t\">256,260,261</a>]. Although macrophages have received most of the attention in mediating efferocytosis, other cell types can perform the same function, including epithelial and endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stromal cells.</p><p>Macrophages recognize apoptotic cells through molecular patterns, reminiscent of microbial recognition by innate immune cells. The plasma membrane of viable cells actively maintains an asymmetric phospholipid distribution such that phosphatidylserine is kept on the inner side of the membrane bilayer. Apoptosis perturbs this asymmetry and exposes phosphatidylserine on the cell's outer surface, leading to its recognition by macrophages bearing phosphatidylserine receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/262-264\" class=\"abstract_t\">262-264</a>]. Upon recognition of apoptotic cells, macrophages release anti-inflammatory IL-10, PGE<sub>2</sub>, and TGF-beta to complete the task of maintaining immune homeostasis. In turn, the apoptotic process in monocytes and macrophages themselves is regulated by a complex network of differentiation factors and inflammatory stimuli that determine their lifespan and thus their participation in the yin-yang of host defense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/265\" class=\"abstract_t\">265</a>].</p><p>The pathogenicity of some bacteria depends on their release of cytotoxins that induce phagocyte necrosis and temporarily overwhelm efferocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/266\" class=\"abstract_t\">266</a>].

This apparently contradictory combination of problems has been attributed to the dual functions of NADPH oxidase, which is defective in the neutrophils and macrophages of patients with this disease. Infections result from defective NADPH oxidase-dependent, phagocytosis-associated generation of microbicidal oxygen metabolites, such as hydrogen peroxide. Excessive inflammation is attributed to a defect in the regulation of inflammation by NADPH oxidase, and studies with murine and human CGD phagocytes show failure during phagocytosis to activate nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key redox-sensitive anti-inflammatory regulator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/272\" class=\"abstract_t\">272</a>].

Specifically, vaccination with protein antigen alone results in a short-lived proliferative response of B or T lymphocytes. However, a very different response ensues if endotoxin is included with the antigen, which more accurately reflects the way the human body would encounter most microbial antigens in nature. Including adjuvant results in a long-lived response from effector T cells, a persistent antibody response, and the development of immunologic memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/280,281\" class=\"abstract_t\">280,281</a>].

The best studied of the alarmins are high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), S100 proteins, and heat-shock proteins. Once released extracellularly, alarmins can activate innate immune cells to release proinflammatory cytokines and otherwise promote sepsis syndrome or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system/abstract/228,282,283\" class=\"abstract_t\">228,282,283</a>].
