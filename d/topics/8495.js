Hyperkinetic disorders are reviewed here. Bradykinetic disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradykinetic movement disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hyperkinetic disorders are characterized by abnormal involuntary movement. These excess movements can be regular and rhythmic, as in tremor; more sustained and patterned, as in dystonia; brief and random, as in chorea; or jerk-like and temporarily suppressible, as in tics. Diagnosis of the specific condition depends primarily upon careful observation of the clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Tics are the most common hyperkinetic disorder in children. Dystonia, stereotypies, choreoathetosis, tremors, and myoclonus also occur but are less common. Many hyperkinetic movement disorders manifest with multiple types of movements, which may include a combination of the various hyperkinesias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY OF THE BASAL GANGLIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A brief review of the anatomy of the basal ganglia is appropriate since this site is involved in many of the bradykinetic disorders. The basal ganglia regulate the initiation, scaling, and control of the amplitude and direction of movement. Movement disorders can result from biochemical or structural abnormalities in these structures.</p><p>The basal ganglia are a complex of deep nuclei that consist of the corpus striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. The corpus striatum, which includes the caudate nucleus and the putamen, receives input from the cerebral cortex and the thalamus and, in turn, projects to the globus pallidus.</p><p>The substantia nigra is divided into the dopamine-rich pars compacta and the less dense pars reticularis. The pars reticularis is similar histologically and chemically to the medial segment of the globus pallidus, and both project via the thalamus to the premotor and motor cortex. The substantia nigra pars compacta gives rise to the nigral-striatal pathway, which is the main dopaminergic tract.</p><p>The output of the basal ganglia projects by way of the thalamus to the cerebral cortex and then to the pyramidal system. Basal ganglia output is sometimes referred to as the extrapyramidal system because it was formerly thought to be in parallel with the pyramidal system. Integration of the basal ganglia with the cortex facilitates motor control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TIC DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As defined by the Taskforce on Childhood Movement Disorders, &quot;tics are repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movements or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppressible and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Tics manifest as sudden, brief intermittent movements (motor tics) or utterances (vocal or phonic tics). Unlike dyskinetic movements and dystonias, tics cease during sleep. Although tics can be voluntarily controlled for short periods of time, it is difficult to suppress tics for sustained periods of time. Transient tic disorders are particularly common during childhood, when they occur in up to 25 percent of normal children. Most children with simple motor tics do not require treatment.</p><p>Persistent motor and phonic tics are features of Tourette syndrome, as described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61505 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Secondary causes should be considered in individuals in whom tics begin abruptly, are persistent, or are particularly problematic. Secondary causes of tics include the use of stimulant medications (dopaminergic agonists). Another potential but controversial cause is pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococci (PANDAS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-streptococcal-tonsillopharyngitis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis&quot;, section on 'PANDAS syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tourette syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tourette syndrome (TS) is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tourette-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tourette syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tourette syndrome is a common movement and neurobehavioral disorder in children. The hallmark of TS is the occurrence of multiple motor and vocal (phonic) tics. Tics in TS may be simple, involving a single muscle or muscle group, or complex, involving sequential, coordinated movements. Simple tics include blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head jerking. Complex tics include bizarre gait, kicking, jumping, body gyrations, and seductive or obscene gestures. Involuntary vocalizations may include simple noises to more complex utterances such as coprolalia (shouting of obscenities or profanities), echolalia (repeating what others say), and palilalia (repeating the patient's own words or phrases).</p><p>TS must be differentiated from transient tics, which occur in otherwise normal children and spontaneously remit in a few weeks or months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61505 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DYSTONIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of dystonia, as updated in 2013 by an international consensus committee of movement disorder experts, is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dystonic movements are typically patterned, twisting, and may be tremulous</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dystonia is often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation</p><p/><p>The consensus committee also updated the classification system for dystonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59278 \">table 2</a>), basing it upon clinical characteristics and etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The clinical characteristics include age at onset, body distribution, temporal pattern, coexistence of other movement disorders, and other neurologic manifestations. The etiologic characteristics are the presence or absence of nervous system pathology and the pattern of inheritance.</p><p>Historically, dystonia was classified as primary, secondary, or psychogenic depending upon the cause. By definition, primary dystonia (formerly known as dystonia musculorum deformans or idiopathic torsion dystonia) was associated with no other neurologic impairment, such as intellectual, pyramidal, cerebellar, or sensory deficits. However, tremor that appears identical to essential tremor occurs in approximately 20 percent of patients with this condition. In some families, dystonia and essential tremor coexist. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Essential tremor'</a> below.)</p><p>Cerebral palsy is probably the most common cause of acquired dystonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51622 \">table 3</a>) seen in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other causes of childhood dystonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70477 \">table 4</a>) include a variety of heredodegenerative disorders such as Wilson disease and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (see <a href=\"#H192849077\" class=\"local\">'Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of involuntary movements occurs before age 20 in approximately 30 percent of patients with dystonia. The distribution of the affected muscle groups appears to depend upon age. The disorder typically begins distally in children, whereas a cranial-cervical distribution is more common in adults. Childhood dystonia usually progresses to a generalized disorder, whereas adult dystonia usually remains focal or segmental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The range of severity of dystonia is variable and may depend upon the situation. As an example, some patients have task-specific dystonias that occur only when they participate in certain activities, such as writing, typing, or playing the piano (&quot;musician's hands&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As the dystonia worsens, it typically extends to adjacent muscles and eventually occurs even at rest. In rare cases, the spasms become severe and may cause cervical disc, nerve, or root problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Muscle breakdown with myoglobinuria (&quot;dystonic storm&quot;) also can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>No specific morphologic changes have been noted in neuropathologic examinations of patients with isolated dystonia. In the brains of a few patients, the norepinephrine concentration was markedly reduced in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus and increased in the red nucleus, suggesting a neurotransmitter abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings. The fluorodopa positron emission tomography (PET) scan is usually normal, although (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose shows an abnormal pattern of metabolic activity when data are averaged from a large group of dystonic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52701546\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemidystonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemidystonia (also known as unilateral dystonia) involves one-half of the body and occurs frequently in children and young adults. In a retrospective series of 33 patients with hemidystonia, approximately 60 percent of patients had a structural lesion in the contralateral basal ganglia, often the putamen, that resulted from an insult to the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most common etiologies were infarction or hemorrhage (30 percent), perinatal injury (27 percent), and trauma (24 percent). Hemidystonia often presented several years after the precipitating factor; this delay occurred more often in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early-onset generalized isolated dystonia (previously called primary dystonia) may be sporadic or inherited. Cases with onset in childhood usually are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70477 \">table 4</a>). Many hereditary cases are caused by a defect in torsinA, a protein with uncertain function that is expressed in the brain. A rare cause of hereditary dystonia is dopa-responsive dystonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">DYT1 dystonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with inherited dystonia have a mutation in the TOR1A (DYT1) gene that encodes the protein torsinA, an ATP-binding protein in the 9q34 locus. DYT1 dystonia is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia#H3959523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of dystonia&quot;, section on 'DYT-TOR1A dystonia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Dopa-responsive dystonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is an unusual form of inherited progressive dystonia that begins during the first decade after birth. The dystonia usually starts in the legs and becomes generalized. Some patients may also have hyperreflexia, rigidity, tremor, and other parkinsonian features, and less commonly, cerebellar signs. The most frequent form of DRD is autosomal dominant DYT5 dystonia.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sydenham-chorea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sydenham chorea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chorea usually develops one to eight months after the inciting infection, in contrast to carditis and arthritis which most often present within 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The onset is usually insidious but may be abrupt.</p><p>The chorea typically begins with distal movements of the hands, but generalized jerking of the face and feet emerges as the chorea becomes more active. The movements are rapid, irregular, and nonstereotyped jerks that are continuous while the patient is awake but improve with sleep. The chorea is usually generalized but may be more prominent on one side; approximately 20 percent of patients have hemichorea (ie, unilateral chorea). Emotional changes, such as easy crying or inappropriate laughing, may precede the development of chorea. In some cases, regression in school performance is the initial concern.</p><p>The diagnosis of Sydenham chorea is made clinically as no specific laboratory test exists.

Most children are delayed in motor and walking milestones. Associated neurologic features of BHC may include myoclonus, upper limb dystonia, and motor and vocal tics. The chorea is nonprogressive and often lessens over time or resolves by early adulthood. However, patients who have myoclonus and chorea early in the course of the disease sometimes develop worsening myoclonus, which becomes the major source of disability as the chorea improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Dystonia is often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation. The current classification system for dystonia is based upon clinical characteristics and etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59278 \">table 2</a>). The clinical characteristics include age at onset, body distribution, temporal pattern, coexistence of other movement disorders, and other neurologic manifestations. The etiologic characteristics are the presence or absence of nervous system pathology and the pattern of inheritance. Cerebral palsy is probably the most common cause of acquired dystonia seen in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51622 \">table 3</a>).

Chorea is defined as an ongoing random-appearing sequence of one or more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Athetosis is defined as a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement that prevents maintenance of a stable posture and thus represents a form of slow chorea. Ballism (ballismus) is defined as chorea that affects proximal joints such as shoulder or hip, leading to large amplitude movements of the limbs, sometimes with a flinging or flailing quality; it is usually unilateral (hemiballismus) and often results from a lesion in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus and adjacent structures.

Although of relatively constant frequency, the amplitude may be variable. Tremor is caused by either alternating or synchronous contractions of antagonistic muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69074\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69074 \">table 9</a>). By definition, tremor should be the only neurologic manifestation of essential tremor (ET), which is usually a benign condition. However, ET may progress to a disabling movement disorder.
