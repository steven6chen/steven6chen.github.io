As an example, one randomized trial compared two doses of fluoxetine with placebo in 387 bulimia nervosa patients for eight weeks, and found that the frequency of vomiting episodes decreased significantly more in patients who received fluoxetine 60 mg per day, compared with either fluoxetine 20 mg or placebo (56 versus 29 and 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bulimia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In addition, adverse events for the two doses of fluoxetine did not differ significantly. &#160;</p><p>Clinicians should prescribe an initial dose of 20 mg once per day and titrate up by increments of 20 mg per day each week, depending upon the therapeutic response, tolerability, and clinical urgency.

SSRIs are prescribed at higher doses for bulimia nervosa than are used to treat major depression. We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, which is supported by the most evidence; the target dose is 60 mg per day. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupropion</a> is contraindicated.
