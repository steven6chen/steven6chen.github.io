There is frequently 2:1 conduction across the atrioventricular (AV) node, meaning that every other atrial depolarization reaches the ventricles. As a result, the ventricular rate is usually one-half the AFL rate in the absence of AV node dysfunction. AFL is classified as typical or atypical based on whether the flutter circuit traverses the cavotricuspid isthmus in the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Other topic reviews discuss the clinical aspects of AFL.

A few years later, the terms types I and II were created to describe flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Type I AFL was classified as a macroreentrant atrial tachycardia while type II AFL was considered unclassified because the mechanisms were not fully understood. </p><p>A 2001 working group from Europe and North America tried to reconcile new data from electrophysiology studies and activation mapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Flutter was defined as a regular tachycardia &ge;240 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> with no isoelectric baseline between atrial deflections. Typical and reversal typical flutter were characterized, as described below, and all other flutters were atypical. &#160;</p><p>An American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and Heart Rhythm Society guideline on the management of supraventricular tachycardia reaffirmed the classification of AFL into cavo-tricuspid-isthmus (CTI)-dependent (&ldquo;typical&rdquo;) versus non-CTI dependent (&ldquo;atypical&rdquo;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and this is the methodology currently used. </p><p><strong>Typical AFL</strong> is a macroreentrant atrial tachycardia, with the inferior border of the circuit traversing the isthmus of tissue between the IVC and tricuspid annulus, or CTI, as a necessary component. AFL involving the cavotricuspid isthmus is referred to as &ldquo;typical&rdquo; or &quot;isthmus-dependent&quot; flutter.</p><p><br/>In the most common form of CTI-dependent flutter, the reentrant circuit rotates around the tricuspid annulus in a counterclockwise direction when the heart is viewed in a left anterior oblique projection, traversing up the septum and down the lateral wall. This is the arrhythmia associated with the classic electrocardiogram finding of sawtooth flutter waves in the inferior leads. (See <a href=\"#H3238574069\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic features'</a> below.) <br/><br/>Less often, the reentrant circuit rotates in the opposite direction. This arrhythmia is called &ldquo;clockwise&rdquo; or &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; typical flutter.</p><p><strong>Atypical AFL</strong> is an intraatrial reentrant tachycardia or AFL that does not involve the CTI. It may be a lesion macroreentrant tachycardia, lower or upper loop flutter, intra-isthmus reentry, non-atriotomy-related right atrial flutter, left atrial macroreentry, post-Maze or atrial fibrillation ablation left atrial flutters, or mitral annular flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is frequently seen in those who have had prior cardiac surgery, prior intracardiac ablation, congenital heart disease, or cardiomyopathy but may also be idiopathic. Atypical flutter may be in the right or left atrium and usually revolves around a prior incisional or idiopathic scar, ablation lesion set, or other fixed anatomic barriers. If there has been an incomplete ablation line from a prior procedure, this can increase the chances of an atypical flutter. Many patients with congenital heart disease, especially with more complex disease or surgical repairs, will present with atypical flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some patients with idiopathic atrial fibrosis will also present with scar-based atypical flutters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrophysiologic studies, using entrainment mapping and electroanatomic mapping, have been used to define the atrial flutter (AFL) circuit in the electrophysiology laboratory and at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. </p><p>The principal electrophysiologic features of AFL are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reentry</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excitable gap</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient entrainment and termination by rapid atrial pacing</p><p/><p>Electrophysiologically, AFL is a reentrant arrhythmia in that it excites an area of the atrium and then travels sufficiently slowly in a pathway that is long enough such that the initially excited area recovers its excitability and is reactivated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/7-9,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,12-15</a>]. Either a single premature extrastimulus or rapid atrial pacing can initiate AFL and, because there is an excitable gap, terminate the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The excitable gap is the portion of a reentrant circuit that has recovered its excitability and can again be depolarized, allowing for entrainment with overdrive pacing during AFL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/13,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Definition and characteristics'</a>.)</p><p>Typical AFL commonly starts after a transitional rhythm of variable duration, usually atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. It has been postulated that a fundamental feature that determines whether an atrial arrhythmia becomes sustained typical AFL or atrial fibrillation is the development of a line of functional refractoriness or block between the vena cavae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In spontaneous typical AFL, the critical line of functional block between the vena cavae may be created by transient atrial fibrillation. This line of block results in unidirectional block and stable AFL follows. According to this theory, if the line of functional block is not created, atrial fibrillation persists or the rhythm reverts back to sinus. </p><p>Another view, based in part on a small electrophysiologic study of 10 patients, emphasizes the anatomic barriers as well as the properties of conduction and refractoriness during atrial fibrillation to explain the usual pattern observed with typical AFL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the electrophysiology laboratory, premature electrical stimulation may function in a manner similar to the transitional atrial fibrillation in forming the critical functional line of block between the vena cavae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>An additional determinant of whether the transitional atrial tachyarrhythmia becomes AFL or atrial fibrillation may be the cycle length of the flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If the cycle length is critically short, it will create fibrillatory conduction and atrial fibrillation. </p><p>Lastly, the electrical properties of the isthmus may also be a factor in the tendency for AFL to disorganize into atrial fibrillation in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Similar to what has been reported in atrial fibrillation, AFL results in electrical remodeling of the atrial myocardium, perhaps accounting for the observation that untreated AFL can eventually lead to atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In contrast to the normal situation in which the atrial refractory period shortens with an increase in rate and prolongs when the rate decreases, the refractory period fails to lengthen appropriately at slow rates (eg, with return to sinus rhythm) in patients with AFL present for a mean of 8.5 months (range 1 to 32 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This abnormality persists for at least 30 minutes after cardioversion to sinus rhythm; the duration of AFL has no significant impact upon the magnitude of these electrophysiologic changes. Those with a history of AFL, but not fibrillation, have significant changes in the electrophysiologic properties of the right atrium, even when they are in normal sinus rhythm. The right atrium is more likely to be enlarged, have lower voltage suggesting scar, longer P wave duration, and slowed conduction velocity most prominent in the lower right atrium, and sinus node dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The duration of AFL does impact the time course of electrical remodeling recovery after arrhythmia termination. As an example, one study of 25 patients with paroxysmal or chronic flutter (average duration 17 months) found that, in those with paroxysmal AFL, the refractory period shortened after a 5- to 10-minute period of flutter and reversed within five minutes of restoration of sinus rhythm; atrial fibrillation developed in some patients when the refractory period was at its nadir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In patients with chronic AFL, the atrial refractory period increased during the first three weeks after resumption of sinus rhythm. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1915807879\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical flutters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large macroreentrant circuit in the right atrium is involved in typical AFL. </p><p>If one begins the cycle at the end of the negative deflection of the F wave in lead II, the impulse at that point exists in the low right atrial septum between the IVC and the tricuspid valve.</p><p>In counterclockwise typical flutter, the impulse then travels anteriorly through the region of the low septum, ascends superiorly and anteriorly up the septal and posterior walls of the right atrium, and returns or descends over the anterior and lateral free wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52904\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52904 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This circuit is then completed through the region between the tricuspid valve and the inferior vena cava (IVC; counterclockwise reentry). A reverse direction of rotation (clockwise reentry, ascending the anterior wall, and descending the posterior and septal walls) is seen in reverse typical AFL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/3,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25</a>].</p><p>The crista terminalis (and its continuation as the eustachian ridge) and IVC commonly form the posterior barrier, while the tricuspid annulus constitutes the anterior barrier of the circuit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52904\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52904 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26</a>]. This has potential clinical implications, since this region can be a target for ablation therapy in patients with refractory AFL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

The cavotricuspid isthmus is a part of the circuit most vulnerable to interval-dependent conduction delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and termination of AFL with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is due in part to failure of impulse conduction through this tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias#H19009804\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Noncontact mapping'</a>.)</p><p>The typical AFL circuit has been thought to run anterior to the superior vena cava (SVC) in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A study of 15 patients with typical flutter using noncontact and entrainment mapping showed that the posterior wall was a part of the circuit in seven patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a study of 50 patients using entrainment mapping, between one-quarter to one-third did not use the atrial roof anterior to the SVC as part of the circuit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These studies imply that the crista terminalis is not always a fixed barrier to conduction and the circuit can be posterior to the SVC.</p><p>Partial isthmus atrial flutter is a type of typical flutter where a wavefront goes between the IVC and coronary sinus ostium after conducting through the posterior cavo-tricuspid-isthmus (CTI). This wavefront then conducts around the CS ostium and up the septum, but also goes retrograde back into the anterior CTI. For this circuit to occur, there must either be a pectinate muscle that breaks the CTI into an anterior and posterior portion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] or rapid conduction through the eustachian ridge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Intra-isthmus reentry is usually seen in those with prior CTI ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The circuit is contained entirely within the CTI and may be in the septal, medial, or anterior portions, with areas of long fractionated potentials the best target for ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The circuit for lower loop reentry circles around the IVC, on the septal side usually between the IVC and coronary sinus ostium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It exits out on the low lateral wall, with wavefront one conducting up the lateral wall and wavefront two going through the CTI, anterior to the coronary sinus ostium, and up the septal wall in a manner similar to counterclockwise typical flutter. The two wave fronts collide somewhere in the lateral right atrium or septum, but the dominant circuit still encircles the IVC. Lower loop reentry frequently morphs into counterclockwise AFL and may be associated with an atrial myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2726473113\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical right atrial flutters</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2954655481\"><span class=\"h3\">Lesion macroreentrant tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An atriotomy scar or suture line can act as an obstacle to conduction and create reentry. There may also be atrial septal defect patches that can lead to an atypical flutter circuit. In addition, scar from congenital heart disease lesions such as after an atrial level switch surgery (Mustard or Senning repairs) for transposition of the great arteries or after a Fontan repair may lead to atypical flutters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-post-fontan-procedure#H108727344\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients post-Fontan procedure&quot;, section on 'Arrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p>Atriotomy scar-related atypical flutters are the most common of this type, where the scar is vertical along the lateral right atrium. The anterior right atrial wall may have ascending or descending activation depending on whether the circuit is clockwise or counterclockwise, while the septum may have more variable conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The circuit wraps around the incision, with the upper turnaround point between the scar and SVC and the lower turnaround point between the scar and IVC. As is true for all flutters, entrainment and activation mapping are helpful for defining the circuit. The atriotomy region will have double potentials and low voltage to denote its location. During flutter, the double potentials are more widely spaced in the center of the scar and usually become one single fractionated electrogram at the turnaround points. </p><p>Typical flutter may be seen after ablation of this atypical flutter, if a prior cavotricuspid isthmus ablation has not previously been completed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1051891816\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonatriotomy-related right atrial flutter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For unexplained reasons, some patients will have areas of low voltage in the right atrium. This may lead to a scar similar to an atriotomy lesion, even though there has been no cardiac incision. This leads to a flutter wrapping around the scar, though may also be a figure-8 reentry if there is conduction through the low voltage area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

It can be clockwise or counterclockwise, with activation going up or down the anterior right atrial free wall. At least one patient also demonstrated successful ablation in the region between the fossa ovalis and IVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], indicating that this tachycardia circuit may not be as clearly defined as previously thought.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4222302460\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical left atrial flutters</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624051066\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-Maze or atrial fibrillation ablation left atrial flutters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These tachycardias are most frequently due to incomplete ablation lines with gaps that result from the Maze procedure. They are usually seen in the anterior wall, through the roof, or on the septum. Mapping can often be difficult due to low voltages.

Entrainment from a catheter in the coronary sinus will frequently demonstrate concealed entrainment on all poles for mitral annular flutter, but not for other left atrial flutters. It can be difficult to terminate and often needs ablation within the coronary sinus to achieve a line of block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Even in the presence of apparent complete block, there may still be recurrence of mitral flutter as there may only be significant conduction slowing rather than block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268982503\"><span class=\"h3\">Left atrial macroreentry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less commonly, atypical flutters can occur in those with no prior ablation or surgery in the left atrium.

The electrophysiologic characteristics of the AV node, which is a &quot;slow response&quot; tissue in comparison to the atria, primarily determine the ventricular response.
