Many of the TB cases associated with TNF-alpha inhibitors likely represent reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), hence the rationale for screening for LTBI before initiating therapy. In areas of low TB prevalence, a minority of TNF-alpha inhibitor-associated cases represent newly acquired infection.</p><p>Elevated TB rates were first noted in randomized clinical trials of these compounds.

Such studies clearly show that the risk of TB with these agents varies strongly according to background regional TB risk. Older studies conducted before TB screening prior to the initiation of a TNF-alpha inhibitor was widespread report higher risk estimates than more recent studies. A systematic review of TB incidence in patients receiving biologic agents supports these ideas as well as the effectiveness of screening for LTBI prior to the use of these agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107745\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107745 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The first population-based study to compare the incidence of TB among individual TNF-alpha inhibitors was conducted within the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register, a national prospective observational study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70906\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70906 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

However, in a chronic infection model (meant to simulate latent TB), bacillary load was lower and survival was greater in the mice treated with etanercept. The authors noted differences in the degree of granuloma penetration among these animals on autopsy, in that etanercept was found to a lesser extent within granulomas. The authors hypothesized that the greater penetration of granulomas with the monoclonal antibodies could lead to greater interruption of cell-cell signaling and greater granuloma dysfunction as potential explanation for the differential survival observed between the etanercept- and monoclonal antibody-treated animals.

Investigators observed that the <em>M. tuberculosis</em>&ndash;reactive CD8+CCR7-CD45RA+ effector memory T cells (TEMRA cells) that express both granulysin and perforin are significantly downregulated by complement-mediated lysis induced by infliximab's inhibition of membrane-bound TNF. Since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> is well-known to have less membrane TNF-binding capacity and avidity than the monoclonal antibodies, the authors hypothesized that a greater downregulation of these antimicrobial peptides would be seen in monoclonal-treated patients, resulting in less robust human defenses against TB. However, it should be noted that the authors did not directly explore this hypothesis in their study nor did they compare downregulation of these peptides between etanercept and the monoclonal antibodies.</p><p/><p>Data from these and other studies evaluating potential differential effects of these drugs on host immune responses to TB suggest there is biologic plausibility to the observed risk difference in population-based studies.

After widespread institution of TB screening in patients planning to start a TNF-alpha inhibitor in Spain in 2002, investigators measured TB incidence and found a 74 percent reduction in TB among patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>.

Most notably, in early <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> trials, the incidence of TB dropped after the introduction of mandatory screening prior to therapy start [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Other more recent trials also indirectly suggest that screening is effective, in that patients who screen positive and are treated for LTBI have a very low risk for subsequent TB in the setting of TNF-alpha inhibitor use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Screening for LTBI in patients preparing to receive a TNF-alpha inhibitor is recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American College of Rheumatology, and a variety of other agencies and specialist societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/32,34-36,38,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34-36,38,45</a>].</p><p>The management of LTBI is discussed below.

The same concept applies to patients with indeterminate IGRA results. Although the risk of LTBI is lower in such patients than in patients with a positive screening test, treatment for LTBI should be considered if there is a strong likelihood of prior TB exposure (eg, evidence of remote TB disease on chest radiography [regional fibrosis with or without hilar lymphadenopathy], history of close contact with a TB case, or having resided in a country with high TB prevalence).

The optimal interval between starting LTBI therapy and starting a TNF-alpha inhibitor has not been established. Initial recommendations suggested an interval of one month, primarily due to publication of the Spanish experience (discussed above) in which the screening and prevention algorithm associated with a reduction in TB risk used a one-month delay between INH and TNF antagonist initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

A 2007 survey of Infectious Diseases Society of America members of the Emerging Infections Network suggested that, in the United States, NTM infections were more likely than TB in patients receiving these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Respondents were asked to report mycobacterial infections in their patients over the previous six months. In patients receiving biologic therapies, NTM infections were reported nearly twice as often as TB (32 versus 17 cases, respectively). <em>M. avium </em>complex was the most frequently reported NTM species (in 16 patients), followed by <em>M. chelonae </em>(in 5 patients), <em>M. abscessus </em>(in 3 patients), <em>M. marinum </em>(in 3 patients), and others (in 5 patients).</p><p>The epidemiology and clinical presentations of NTM infections in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors was evaluated in a later review of the US MedWatch surveillance system, which included all cases reported through January 1, 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Of 239 cases reported, 105 (44 percent) met NTM disease criteria.

Similar to TB in the TNF antagonist setting, a high rate of extrapulmonary disease was reported (44 percent), which included the skin and soft tissues (26 percent), bones or joints (9 percent), disseminated disease (8 percent), and the eye (1 percent).</p><p>More recently, several population-based studies have been published documenting that TNF-alpha inhibitors increase the risk of NTM disease. In the United States, an area of low background TB prevalence, the incidence of NTM exceeds that of TB in the setting of TNF-alpha inhibition. A study conducted within the northern California Kaiser Permanente population of over 3 million individuals identified incidence of NTM disease of <span class=\"nowrap\">106/100,000</span> among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using these drugs, a rate approximately double that of RA patients without TNF-alpha inhibitor exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107763\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107763 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

For patients with chronic unexplained cough, further evaluation should include chest computerized tomography and culture of respiratory specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/45,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,59</a>].
