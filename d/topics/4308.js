The large intestine is also called the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Often, people have a colonoscopy as a screening test to check for polyps or for cancer in the colon or rectum. Polyps are growths in the colon that might turn into cancer. If you have polyps, the doctor can usually take them out during the colonoscopy. Taking polyps out lowers your chances of getting cancer. People can also have colonoscopy if they have any of the symptoms listed below. Cancer screening tests are tests that are done to try and find cancer early, before a person has symptoms. Cancer that is found early often is small and can be cured or treated easily.</p><p>Doctors can use 5 or 6 different tests to screen for colon cancer. But most doctors think that colonoscopy is the best test to screen for colon cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460793109\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I have colon cancer screening?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors recommend that most people begin having colon cancer screening at age 50. Some people have an increased chance of getting colon cancer, because of a strong family history or certain medical conditions. These people might begin screening at a younger age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460793116\"><span class=\"h1\">What are other reasons my doctor might order a colonoscopy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might order a colonoscopy if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in your bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A change in your bowel habits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called anemia that can make you feel tired and weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term belly or rectal pain that you cannot explain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal results from a different type of colon test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of colon cancer or polyps in your colon</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460793123\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do before a colonoscopy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will give you instructions about what to do before a colonoscopy. He or she will tell you what foods you can and cannot eat. He or she will also tell you if you need to stop taking any of your usual medicines beforehand. Make sure to read the instructions as soon as you get them. You might have to stop some medicines up to a week before the test.</p><p>The colon needs to be cleaned out before a colonoscopy. Your doctor will give you a special drink that causes watery diarrhea. It is important to drink all of it to make sure your colon is clean. If your colon is clean your doctor will get a better look at the inside lining of the colon. A clean colon also makes the test easier to do and more comfortable. Let your doctor know if you have trouble getting ready for your colonoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460793130\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a colonoscopy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will give you medicine to make you feel relaxed. Then he or she will put a thin tube with a camera and light on the end into your anus and up into the rectum and colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>). Your doctor will look at the inside lining of the whole colon.</p><p>During the procedure, your doctor might do a test called a biopsy. During a biopsy, a doctor takes a small piece of tissue from the colon. Then he or she looks at the tissue under a microscope to see if it has cancer. Your doctor might also remove growths that he or she sees in the colon. You will not feel it if the doctor takes a biopsy or removes a growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460793137\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a colonoscopy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will give you instructions about what to do after a colonoscopy. Most people can eat as usual. But most doctors recommend that people do not drive or go to work for the rest of the day. Your doctor will tell you when to start taking any medicines you had to stop before the test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460793144\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following problems after your colonoscopy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain that is much worse than gas pain or cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bloated and hard belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lot of bleeding from your anus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460793151\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-polyps-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon polyps (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bloody stools (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gas-and-bloating-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gas and bloating (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomach-ache-and-stomach-upset-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stomach ache and stomach upset (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-polyps-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon polyps (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
