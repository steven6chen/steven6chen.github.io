It is characterized by narrowing of the airways (breathing tubes) in the lungs. This narrowing is partially or completely reversible. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms tend to come and go, and are related to the degree of airway narrowing in the lungs. The airways are sensitive to a variety of stimuli, which may include viral illnesses (eg, the common cold), allergens, exercise, medicines, or environmental conditions.</p><p>Asthma can usually be treated successfully. This requires being well informed about the disease and being an active player in managing it.</p><p>This topic will review asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (adolescents defined as children 12 years and older). Other topics about asthma are also available.

Common asthma triggers generally fall into several categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergens (including dust, pollen, mold, cockroaches, mice, cats, and dogs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritants (such as tobacco smoke, chemicals, and strong odors or fumes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activity, especially when the air that is breathed is cold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines, known as beta blockers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual cycle in some women</p><p/><p>A small number of patients will develop asthma symptoms after exposure to aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, like ibuprofen or naproxen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Trigger avoidance in asthma (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-avoidance-in-the-treatment-of-asthma-and-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen avoidance in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After identifying potential asthma triggers, you and your clinician should develop a plan to deal with the triggers. There are three main options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid the trigger entirely (eg, if allergic to animals, do not own pets; if sensitive to aspirin or related medications, avoid all forms of these medications).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit exposure to the asthma trigger if it cannot be completely avoided (eg, move to another seat if someone with strong perfume is seated nearby; have someone else do house cleaning if allergic to dust mites).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take an extra dose of bronchodilator medication before exposure to an asthma trigger. This is a common approach prior to exercise, and we encourage you not to avoid exercise. Talk with a healthcare provider before using this approach in other circumstances (for example, if you are cat-allergic and about to be exposed to cat dander); it should only be used if limiting or avoiding exposure is not possible. Be careful not to use more than twice the amount of medication normally used.</p><p/><p>Special approaches to unavoidable allergic triggers include allergy desensitization injections (&quot;allergy shots&quot;) and an injected medication targeting allergy proteins in the blood (anti-immunoglobulin E antibody, called omalizumab). In specialized treatment centers, persons who are sensitive to aspirin and related medications can be desensitized to aspirin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING SYMPTOMS AND LUNG FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful asthma treatment relies on your ability to monitor your condition over time. This is done by observing the frequency and severity of symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath) and by measuring lung function with a peak flow meter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma diary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider may recommend keeping a daily asthma diary when symptoms are not well controlled or when starting a new treatment. In the diary, your peak flow readings, asthma symptoms (eg, coughing, wheezing), and medications are recorded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74684\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef74684 \">form 1</a>).</p><p>A periodic diary may be recommended if you have stable symptoms and your medications have not changed recently. This type of diary can be completed before visiting the healthcare provider and helps you and your healthcare provider to determine whether the asthma treatment plan needs to be adjusted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54723\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef54723 \">form 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Peak expiratory flow (PEF)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PEF measures the rate at which you can exhale. This rate is dependent on the degree of airway narrowing: the narrower your bronchial tubes, the slower the air will flow out of your lungs (and so, the lower your peak flow). PEF monitoring can be used to monitor your lung function and response to treatment, assess the severity of asthma attacks, and guide decisions regarding treatment.</p><p>Peak flow meters are inexpensive and easy to use. Adults with persistent and troublesome asthma may, at times, use a peak flow meter once or twice daily to monitor their lung function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-a-peak-flow-meter-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: How to use a peak flow meter (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Review of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescents and adults with asthma are usually seen by their healthcare provider once or twice a year if their asthma is well-controlled or more often if their asthma is not well-controlled. At these visits, the healthcare provider will evaluate the severity and frequency of your asthma symptoms and response to treatment. If your asthma control has been adequate for at least three months, you may be asked to continue your treatment or your medication dose may be decreased. If control is not adequate, your medication schedule, the proper use of inhaled medications, and trigger avoidance will be reviewed, and your medication program may be intensified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CATEGORIES OF ASTHMA SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medications used for asthma treatment vary according to your age (young children versus adolescents and adults), the severity of asthma, and how well your symptoms are controlled. The asthma treatment plan must be reviewed and adjusted on a regular basis. If symptoms are well controlled, medication can sometimes be reduced. As symptoms worsen, medication should be increased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with intermittent asthma are defined as those who have the following characteristics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intermittent and mild persistent asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of asthma occur two or fewer days per week</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma does not interfere with daily activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nighttime symptoms awaken you two or fewer nights per month</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Albuterol is needed to relieve asthma symptoms fewer than two days a week</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral steroid treatment (eg, prednisone) is needed no more than once per year to treat increased asthma symptoms</p><p/><p>If your asthma is triggered only by vigorous exercise (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction) and can be prevented by pre-treatment with a quick-acting bronchodilator medicine, you might fit into this category, even if you exercise more than twice per week. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with persistent asthma have symptoms regularly. There may be days when your activities are limited due to symptoms, and you may often be awakened from sleep. </p><p>Based on how frequently you have symptoms together with measurement of your lung function, the clinician will determine whether your persistent asthma is mild, moderate, or severe. Treatment plans will vary based upon the severity of your asthma, as well as the adequacy of your symptom control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of moderate persistent asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The symptoms that are used to determine your asthma severity and control include the number of days per week that you have one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms such as cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nighttime symptoms that awaken you from sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that need treatment with a bronchodilator (reliever medication)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that affect your ability to participate in normal activities</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA RELIEVER MEDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchodilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-acting bronchodilators (referred to medically as &quot;beta-2 agonists&quot;) relieve asthma symptoms rapidly, by temporarily relaxing the muscles around narrowed airways. In the United States, albuterol (brand names: Ventolin, Proventil, ProAir, and ProAir RespiClick) is the most commonly used short-acting bronchodilator; levalbuterol (Xopenex) is also in this category. These medications are sometimes referred to as &quot;quick-acting relievers&quot; or &quot;rescue medication.&quot; People with intermittent asthma, the mildest form of asthma, will require these symptom-relieving medications only occasionally.</p><p>The preferred way of taking medication for mild intermittent asthma is by inhalation with a metered dose (Ventolin, Proventil, ProAir, and Xopenex) or dry powder (ProAir RespiClick) inhaler. This method allows the medication to take effect rapidly with maximum strength and minimal side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no benefit to using short-acting bronchodilators on a regular, scheduled basis. They are meant to be used as needed for relief of asthma symptoms, or preventively prior to an activity that is known to provoke symptoms. If your asthma symptoms are consistently occurring more than two days per week, you should review your treatment plan with a healthcare provider. Other medications are more effective for persistent symptoms in this situation. It is not necessary to wait one minute between inhalations of your short-acting bronchodilator, if you are taking a dose of two &quot;puffs.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects of bronchodilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people feel shaky, have a rapid heart rate, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feel anxious after using an inhaled short-acting bronchodilator. Using a single puff rather than the usual two puffs may limit these side effects and only minimally decrease their benefit. In addition, these side effects usually become less noticeable over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA CONTROLLER MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with persistent asthma need to take medication on a daily basis to keep their asthma under control, even if there are no symptoms of active asthma on a given day. Medications taken daily for asthma are called &quot;long-term controller&quot; medicines.</p><p>Some controller medicines are delivered by inhaler, while others are taken as a tablet. The doses and types of controller medications prescribed depend upon your asthma severity and adequacy of symptom control. For more severe asthma, more than one controller medication may be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhaled steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled steroids (also known as glucocorticoids or corticosteroids) act to decrease inflammation (swelling) of the airways over time. The steroids used to treat asthma are entirely different from the ones athletes take to build muscle. Regular treatment with an inhaled steroid reduces the frequency of symptoms (and the need for inhaled bronchodilators for symptom relief), improves quality of life, and decreases the risk of serious attacks.</p><p>A number of different inhaled steroid medications are available, all of which are taken once or twice a day. </p><p>An inhaled bronchodilator is still used as needed for relief of symptoms and before exposure to asthma triggers. There is no need to take the inhaled bronchodilator (&quot;to open up the airways&quot;) before each daily dose of inhaled steroid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects of inhaled steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike steroids that are taken as tablet or liquid by mouth, very little of the inhaled steroid is absorbed into the bloodstream, and there are few side effects. However, as the dose of inhaled steroid is increased, small amounts of the inhaled medication are absorbed into the bloodstream, and the risk of long-term side effects increases.</p><p>The most common side effect of <strong>low-dose </strong>inhaled steroid is oral candidiasis (thrush). This can usually be prevented by rinsing your mouth or brushing your teeth and tongue immediately after inhalation and, if your inhaled steroid is delivered from a metered dose inhaler, by using a spacer (which helps to deliver medication to the lungs, with less deposited in the mouth) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56533 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>A hoarse voice and sore throat (without thrush) are less common side effects that are usually managed by changing to a different inhaled steroid preparation or delivery system.</p><p>Rare but possible side effects of long-term <strong>high-dose</strong> inhaled steroid treatments, besides oral candidiasis, include cataracts, increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma), easy bruising of the skin, and increased bone loss (osteoporosis).</p><p>The risk of these complications is far less with inhaled glucocorticoids compared with oral glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone). Nevertheless, every effort should be made to use the lowest possible dose that controls asthma and minimizes the risk of an asthma attack.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-acting bronchodilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A long-acting inhaled bronchodilator is often recommended, in combination with an inhaled steroid, for adults with persistent asthma. Long-acting bronchodilators (salmeterol, formoterol, vilanterol) are recommended because they work for a longer period than short-acting bronchodilators (for 12 or more hours). A device that contains both an inhaled steroid and a long-acting bronchodilator is usually preferred (sample brand names: Advair, Breo, Dulera, Seretide [in Europe], Symbicort). A short-acting bronchodilator is still used as needed for immediate relief of asthma symptoms. Theophylline is a long-acting bronchodilator available in tablet form. It is rarely used because of frequent associated side effects, drug interactions, limited effectiveness, and risk of life-threatening complications from medication overdose.</p><p>Tiotropium (Spiriva) is a once-daily, long-acting bronchodilator that works by a different mechanism than those listed above (which, like albuterol, are &quot;beta agonists&quot;). It too is best used in combination with an inhaled steroid. It is available as a dry-powder system (a capsule containing the medication is loaded into its delivery system for each dose) or as a multi-dose, soft-mist inhaler called Respimat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukotriene modifiers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukotriene modifiers, such as montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), or zileuton (Zyflo) are an alternative to inhaled glucocorticoids. Leukotriene modifiers work by opening narrowed airways, decreasing inflammation, and decreasing mucus production. They are taken by mouth as a pill once or twice daily and have very few side effects. Mood alteration and depression are rare side effects. However, compared with inhaled glucocorticoids, leukotriene modifiers are generally somewhat less effective in controlling asthma.</p><p>Leukotriene modifiers can be used to prevent symptoms before exposure to a trigger or before exercising, but need to be taken three or more hours prior to the exposure or exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If symptoms are not controlled with the above medications, an oral steroid (eg, prednisone or methylprednisolone) may be added to the treatment regimen. Most healthcare providers recommend a 5 to 10 day course of oral glucocorticoids for flares of asthma. Side effects are common, including increased energy, insomnia, hunger, agitation, and mood alteration, but they generally can be tolerated for a short period during which restoration of normal breathing is the priority.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3253611325\"><span class=\"h2\">Omalizumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antibodies that cause allergies to pollen, animal dander, dust mite, cockroach, and mold are in the immunoglobulin E family. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of IgE. It can help decrease asthma symptoms and asthma exacerbations in people with allergic asthma. It works best in people with a blood IgE level between 30 and 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> who are allergic to year-round allergens, like dust mite, mold, animal dander, and cockroach. Omalizumab is given by injection every 2 to 4 weeks. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4101962686\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-IL-5 agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a protein that is associated with a certain subtype of asthma (called &quot;eosinophilic asthma&quot;). People with this type of asthma may benefit from medications directed against IL-5, such as the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies mepolizumab and reslizumab and the anti-IL-5 receptor antibody benralizumab. These medications are only used in patients with severe asthma who have increased eosinophils, determined by a blood test. They are given by injection in a doctor's office or clinic, every 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the medication. Allergic reactions can sometimes happen with these medications, so you need to be observed after the injection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE-INDUCED ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If exercise is a trigger for asthma, an extra dose of bronchodilator medication or a leukotriene modifier can be used to prevent asthma symptoms. If these agents alone do not fully prevent asthma symptoms with exercise, addition of daily inhaled steroid &quot;controller&quot; medication may be needed to decrease inflammation in the airways. A topic review that discusses exercise-induced asthma is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA IN PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is the most common chronic medical condition that affects the lungs during pregnancy. About 8 percent of pregnant women have asthma. With good asthma treatment during pregnancy, most women can breathe easily, have a normal pregnancy, and give birth to a healthy baby. It is essential to keep asthma well controlled during pregnancy to ensure that optimal levels of oxygen reach the baby.</p><p>Before becoming pregnant, women with asthma should learn as much as they can about the condition and talk with their healthcare providers about asthma treatment during pregnancy. More information about asthma during pregnancy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA ATTACK TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;asthma attack&quot; is somewhat confusing because it does not distinguish between a mild increase in symptoms and a life-threatening episode. In general, an asthma attack refers to an increase in asthma symptoms above one's usual level in a way that interferes with normal activities. Symptoms may be aggravated by changes in air quality, the common cold, exercise, exposure to allergens, or changes in the weather. These triggers can cause mild, moderate, or severe symptoms to develop. Any of these changes could be considered an asthma &quot;attack.&quot;</p><p>Some people have periodic, mild asthma attacks that never require emergency care, while others have severe and sudden asthma attacks that require a call for emergency medical services.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma action plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should work with your healthcare provider to develop personalized directions (also called an asthma action plan) to follow when symptoms increase or your peak flow begins to decrease. Asthma action plans for adolescents and adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53142\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef53142 \">form 3</a>) and school asthma action plans (<a href=\"http://www.aafa.org/pdfs/2010StudentAsthmaActionCard.pdf&amp;token=Zhk3SsDNzGEOSDTcBVv9ffWZwwnow4OjM3m6c8YX2p9ze29/geDLsPEaTE7OBj4PKS0pJJgA+M7WEjqFZ5sLbw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=371\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Asthma and Allergy Foundation asthma action card</a>) are available.</p><p>Peak expiratory flows can be divided into three zones, which are assigned colors like those of a traffic light. These zones can be used to make decisions about the need for treatment:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Green</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Green signals that the lungs are functioning well. When symptoms are not present or are well controlled, you should continue your regular medicines and activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Yellow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yellow is a sign that the airways in the lungs are somewhat narrowed, making it difficult to move air in and out; asthma symptoms may be more frequent or more severe. A short-term change or increase in medication is generally required. You should change or increase your medication according to the plan that was discussed with your provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Red</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Red is a sign that the airways are severely narrowed and require immediate treatment. Symptoms are usually more severe and frequent. In addition to using 2 to 4 puffs of the quick-acting reliever inhaler (eg, albuterol), oral steroid tablets are often required to bring relief, according to the plan discussed with your provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency care plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should work with your healthcare provider to formulate an emergency care plan that explains exactly what to do if symptoms worsen. This may include more frequent use of a reliever medication (eg, albuterol) and starting or increasing the dose of a controller medication (eg, prednisone).</p><p>However, if symptoms are severe and worsen or do not improve after use of a quick-acting reliever medication, you (or a helper) should immediately call for emergency medical assistance. Severe asthma attacks can be fatal if not treated promptly. In most areas of the United States, emergency medical assistance is available by calling 911. You should <strong>not</strong> attempt to drive yourself to the hospital, and you should not ask someone else to drive. Calling 911 is safer than driving for two reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>From the moment Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel arrive, they can begin evaluating and treating your asthma. When driving in a car, treatment is generally delayed until you arrive in the emergency department.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a dangerous complication of asthma occurs on the way to the hospital, EMS personnel will able to treat the problem immediately.</p><p/><p>Following an asthma attack, most people are given a 5 to 10 day course of an oral steroid medication (eg, prednisone).

If an accident occurs and you cannot explain your condition, the identification will help responders provide appropriate care.</p><p>The alert tag should include a list of major medical conditions and allergies, as well as the name and phone number of an emergency contact. Some devices provide a toll-free number that emergency medical workers can call to find out a person's medical history, list of medications, family emergency contact numbers, and healthcare provider names and numbers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=371\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
