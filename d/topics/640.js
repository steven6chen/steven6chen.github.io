Both are associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), have similar features on renal histology (eg, a focal necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis), and have similar outcomes. There are, however, several differences between these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H11698538\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with GPA or MPA are initially treated with immunosuppressive therapy to induce remission, most often consisting of glucocorticoids in combination with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. Patients who attain remission are then treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, which are less toxic than cyclophosphamide, and low-dose glucocorticoids to maintain the remission. The usual duration of maintenance therapy after stable remission has been induced is 12 to 18 months. More prolonged maintenance therapy should be considered in patients who have multiple disease relapses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Relapses occur either on maintenance therapy or after maintenance therapy has been discontinued. Patients who have more than minor relapses while on maintenance therapy and relapses occurring in patients who are no longer on maintenance immunosuppression are usually treated with reinstitution of the initial induction regimen.
