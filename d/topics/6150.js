The transmission of <em>Bartonella</em> to humans most often results via a cat scratch involving the claw of a cat that is contaminated with <em>Bartonella</em>-infected flea feces. Cat fleas become infected with <em>B. henselae</em> after feeding on the cat. While on the cat, the fleas excrete feces that contain <em>Bartonella</em>. The cat&rsquo;s claw becomes contaminated with flea feces when the cat scratches its skin in an area infested with fleas.</p><p><em>B. quintana</em> infections predominantly occur in homeless persons with body lice. With <em>B. quintana</em>, it is believed that humans serve as the reservoir and body lice are the vectors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88095191\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of clinically evident <em>Bartonella</em> infections in persons with HIV is relatively low. As an example, in one study from Germany, the prevalence of HIV-associated bacillary angiomatosis was 1.2 cases per 1000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast, seroepidemiologic studies have reported a high seroprevalence of antibodies against <em>Bartonella</em> infection among individuals with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serologic study in Spain demonstrated a higher percentage of persons with HIV infection who had <em>B. henselae</em> immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) titers &ge;1:64 compared with HIV-negative blood donors (9 of 52 [17 percent] versus 5 of 85 [5 percent], respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study involving individuals with HIV infection in Greece, 41 percent had positive IgG antibodies to <em>B. henselae</em>, but the investigators did not show any correlation of these results with clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14119143\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88095287\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), clinically evident <em>Bartonella</em> infections occur relatively infrequently in persons with HIV infection. Nevertheless, <em>Bartonella</em> infection is still observed among patients with advanced HIV infection (eg, CD4 count &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> such as those who have undiagnosed HIV disease, poor access to medications, or suboptimal adherence to their treatment regimen. In one study, for example, 42 HIV-infected patients with <em>B. henselae</em> had a median CD4 count of 21 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>When patients with advanced immunosuppression become infected with <em>Bartonella</em>, they often present with cutaneous violaceous lesions, which can also involve other internal organs; this form of disease is called bacillary angiomatosis. <em>Bartonella</em> species can produce a broad array of additional manifestations in persons with HIV infection, including bacillary peliosis (infection of the liver), splenitis, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia. </p><p>Manifestations of <em>Bartonella</em> infection can vary based on the particular species involved. In one study of 49 patients with <em>Bartonella</em>-associated infections, 46 of whom had HIV infection, the two <em>Bartonella</em> species had differing organ tropism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <em>B. henselae</em> was the major cause of lymph node, liver, and splenic lesions, whereas <em>B. quintana</em> was the predominant cause of bone or subcutaneous masses; either organism appeared equally capable of causing cutaneous lesions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacillary angiomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is characterized by unique vascular lesions that most frequently involve the skin, but can affect other organs, such as the respiratory tract, bone, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. With all forms of BA, patients may have constitutional symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, headache, and anorexia with or without weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Cutaneous lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous lesions in BA may appear as angiomatous lesions that are difficult to diagnose because of the differing appearances. The lesions most frequently consist of papular, nodular, pedunculated, or verrucous forms. They typically first develop as small red to purple papules that may gradually expand into large pedunculated lesions or nodules that may become friable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The surface generally starts off smooth but subsequently may erode, with or without crusting. The lesions usually have a vascular appearance and may bleed profusely with trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78497%7EID%2F82760%7EID%2F82759\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78497 graphicRef82760 graphicRef82759 \">picture 1A-C</a>).</p><p>Most often, BA lesions are solitary or several in number, but rarely may appear in a disseminated version manifested by more than 1000 small lesions. Infrequently observed forms of cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis include a cellulitic plaque that often overlies an osteolytic lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and hyperpigmented, hyperkeratotic plaques that have scaling and minimal superficial evidence of vascularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>].</p><p>Cutaneous BA lesions may resemble Kaposi's sarcoma, pyogenic granuloma, cherry angioma, dermatofibroma, hemangioma, and verruga peruana, the cutaneous lesions associated with South American bartonellosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=south-american-bartonellosis-oroya-fever-and-verruga-peruana\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;South American bartonellosis: Oroya fever and verruga peruana&quot;</a>). The nodular and plaque forms of BA may resemble lesions caused by mycobacteria, tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and sporotrichosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Subcutaneous lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous lesions may develop as deeper seated, tender nodules that have erythematous or normal-appearing overlying skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These lesions can erode through the cutaneous surface and become superinfected. Less frequently, the lesions develop as an enlarging deep suppurative ulcer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82761 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Osseous lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone involvement in patients with BA is not uncommon; in one series, 6 of 17 patients with cutaneous BA had symptomatic osteolytic bone lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Rarely, focal osteomyelitis has developed prior to any other manifestation of BA. Patients with bone involvement present with painful bone lesions, most often involving long bones such as the tibia, fibula, and radius. These patients also often have an overlying cellulitic plaque. Bone radiographs show lytic lesions; technetium scans show increased uptake at these same sites. Bone lesions can range from focal well-circumscribed lytic areas to ill-defined areas that show aggressive cortical destruction with notable periosteal reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Mucosal lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cutaneous lesions of BA are often widespread and can affect the mucosa. Conversely, oral lesions can occur without cutaneous manifestations. Several reports have described lesions on the gingival region, buccal mucosa, oral labial mucosa, hard palate, and posterior pharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The mucosal lesions appear as smooth purple papules or plaques that may resemble pyogenic granuloma or Kaposi's sarcoma. Rarely, patients may develop a conjunctival, nodular mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Central nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system disease is relatively uncommon. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report described a patient with intracerebral BA; this patient had a 2 cm mass lesion that preceded the development of a cutaneous BA lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Brain biopsy studies, including Warthin-Starry staining and electron microscopy, showed evidence of typical-appearing <em>Bartonella</em> bacilli. The patient had a gradual, but dramatic clinical and radiographic response to a prolonged course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An additional probable, but not confirmed, case of BA involved a patient with trigeminal neuralgia, low back pain, and spine magnetic resonance imaging findings suggesting vascular defects in L3 and L4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This patient's lesions resolved with antibiotic therapy. </p><p/><p>Other reports have described aseptic meningitis, dementia, and psychiatric symptoms possibly related to <em>Bartonella</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, a large study using the San Diego HIV Neurobehavioral Research Study database failed to show any correlation between <em>B. henselae</em> serostatus and neurocognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacillary peliosis and splenitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first report of bacillary peliosis among persons with HIV infection appeared in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this report, liver biopsy specimens from eight patients showed cystic blood filled spaces in the hepatic parenchyma and clumps of granular purple material; both Warthin-Starry staining and electron microscopy identified this granular purple material as bacilli identical to those found in patients with cutaneous BA. Patients had hepatomegaly and increases in alkaline phosphatase of approximately five times normal. Six of the eight patients also had splenomegaly; two of three patients whose splenic tissue was analyzed had evidence of splenic peliosis. Two of these eight patients had concomitant cutaneous BA. </p><p>One case report has described a 29-year-old with fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, anorexia, and hepatomegaly who was discovered to have massive hemoperitoneum and hypovolemic shock as the main manifestation of hepatic bacillary parenchymal peliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This case highlights the importance of including bacillary peliosis and bacillary angiomatosis in the differential diagnosis of fever and abdominal pain in patients with HIV infection. Although rare, the risk of hepatic hemorrhage in bacillary peliosis should be considered in the setting of an individual with HIV infection who has hypovolemic shock.</p><p>Subsequent reports have noted thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia in patients with peliosis hepatis and splenitis. Patients with splenitis can have an acute necrotizing inflammatory response without evidence of angiomatosis. Abdominal computed tomography typically shows organomegaly and hypodense lesions scattered throughout the organ parenchyma. However, other conditions can produce similar radiographic findings, such as lymphoma, disseminated <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex, and extrapulmonary <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteremia, endocarditis, and unexplained fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with HIV infection who have BA or peliosis hepatis may also occasionally have blood cultures positive for <em>Bartonella</em>. In one report, extended incubation blood cultures identified two cases of <em>Bartonella</em> infection among 45 AIDS patients who had unexplained fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A few reports have described <em>Bartonella</em>-associated endocarditis among individuals with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endocarditis-caused-by-bartonella\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endocarditis caused by Bartonella&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because isolation of the <em>Bartonella</em> organisms in culture remains difficult, bacteremia is probably significantly underdiagnosed. In a study of 382 patients with unexplained fever (95 percent infected with HIV), 68 (18 percent) had evidence of <em>Bartonella</em> infection by culture, polymerase chain reaction, or indirect immunofluorescence antibody testing; only 11 patients had <em>Bartonella</em> isolated from blood or tissue specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most of the patients with evidence of <em>Bartonella</em> infection had advanced HIV disease and a CD4 count less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. It is not clear that <em>Bartonella</em>, when isolated, was the cause of unexplained fever in these patients, since no information on therapy and follow-up was provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951509200\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. henselae</em> has been associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).
