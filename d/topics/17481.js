It usually occurs in the region corresponding to the aortic isthmus (located between the left subclavian and the first intercostal arteries) as a result of shear forces generated by unrestrained frontal collisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] or by side-impact crashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The major risk of TAR is adventitial rupture which usually results in lethal hemorrhage. In a multicenter trial that enrolled 274 patients with TAR, the overall mortality rate reached 31 percent, with 63 percent of deaths attributable to aortic rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Despite modern acute care, hemodynamic instability remains a major mortality risk factor in patients with TAR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although aortography was previously considered the clinical gold standard for the diagnosis of TAR, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] are now the predominant imaging modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The main advantage of TEE is its portability and repeatability at the bedside in patients with multiple traumatic injuries consistent with management strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has more recently emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool for the precise characterization of TAR, especially when CT is equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and on-line guidance of endovascular repair and accurate endograft sizing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Diagnosis and management of blunt thoracic aortic injury, and the technical aspects of TEE are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular repair of blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography: Indications, complications, and normal views&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TEE FINDINGS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBADVENTITIAL TRAUMATIC AORTIC RUPTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) diagnosis of subadventitial traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) requires the presence of a disruption of the aortic wall with flow on both sides of the lesion that can be identified by color Doppler imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. TEE findings associated with subadventitial TAR are most frequently observed in the region corresponding to the aortic isthmus (typically about 25 to 35 cm from the incisors, immediately distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery).</p><p>Typically, a thick and irregular intraluminal flap is seen traversing the lumen of the aortic isthmus in the transverse view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63952\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63952 \">image 1A</a>). Since this lesion corresponds to disruption of the entire thickness of both intimal and medial aortic layers, it should be considered a &quot;medial flap.&quot; In the longitudinal view, the medial flap is nearly perpendicular to the aortic wall, since traumatic lesions are usually confined to a few centimeters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63952%7ECARD%2F63464\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63952 graphicRef63464 \">image 1A-B</a>). </p><p>An abnormal aortic contour is also commonly observed due to the acute formation of a localized false aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]; the wall of the false aneurysm consists of the adventitial layer under pressure. Depending on the size of this false aneurysm, the thoracic aorta may or may not be enlarged (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76283%7ECARD%2F76883%7ECARD%2F63952\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76283 graphicRef76883 graphicRef63952 \">image 1C-D</a>).</p><p>Color Doppler echocardiography typically depicts similar blood flow velocities on both sides of the medial flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63464\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63464 \">image 1B</a>). In addition, a mosaic of colors surrounding the disrupted aortic wall may be observed, reflecting local blood flow turbulence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63464\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63464 \">image 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Mediastinal hematomas can be accurately diagnosed using TEE and are observed in most patients sustaining TAR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Diagnosis is based on the presence of an increased distance between TEE probe and the anteromedial aortic wall <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of an ultrasound signal consistent with blood between the posterolateral aortic wall and the left visceral pleura (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61327\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61327 \">image 2</a>). Mediastinal hematomas can also occur in the absence of traumatic aortic injury, (eg, laceration of small mediastinal vessels, vertebrae fractures). However, mediastinal hematomas are usually larger when associated with TAR than those secondary to other traumatic injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TAR should be distinguished from acute aortic dissection, which can occasionally be induced by chest trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.) Several TEE findings help when distinguishing between those two conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57912 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76283%7ECARD%2F76883\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76283 graphicRef76883 \">image 1C-D</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63464\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63464 \">image 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Importantly, TAR does not result in two distinct channels as seen in aortic dissection. Thus, blood flow velocities as evidenced by color Doppler imaging appear similar on both sides of the medial flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63464\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63464 \">image 1B</a>); in contrast, the false lumen in aortic dissection usually has a slower velocity than the true lumen. </p><p>A second potential diagnostic problem is that protuberant atherosclerotic changes of the aorta may be challenging to differentiate from partial TAR and may mask underlying localized subadventitial aortic tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Finally, linear artifacts within the aortic lumen may be misdiagnosed as medial flaps. TEE diagnostic criteria have been validated, thus limiting the risk of false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER TRAUMATIC AORTIC INJURIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) allows accurate diagnosis of other types of aortic injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial traumatic aortic injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These lesions are too small and superficial to exert an excessive pressure on the adventitial layer. Therefore, both the aortic diameter and contour usually remain unchanged and no or little blood flow turbulence is evidenced using color Doppler mapping. These injuries may be isolated or associated with a subadventitial traumatic aortic rupture TAR.</p><p>Intimal tears appear as thin, mobile, and short (usually &lt;10 mm) intraluminal appendages of the aortic wall, commonly located at or in the immediate vicinity of the aortic isthmus.</p><p>Wall thrombi within the aortic lumen may also be observed as a result of violent chest trauma. These thrombi may be voluminous and highly mobile, resulting in arterial emboli. They are typically located in the proximal descending thoracic aorta, which is otherwise free of atherosclerotic changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other traumatic aortic injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic dissections and intramural hematomas have been described using TEE in patients sustaining severe blunt chest trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>]. Intraluminal obstruction caused by the disrupted aortic wall may result in a pseudo-coarctation syndrome and associated ischemia. In this case, TEE depicts usually an intermittent aortic obstruction with a maximal pressure gradient greater than 20 mmHg using continuous wave Doppler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. TAR of the ascending aorta has been rarely identified using TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], since it usually results in death on scene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF TEE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single imaging can identify all cases of traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. More than one imaging modality <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> repeated imaging may be required to establish the diagnosis. Given the high sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for thoracic aortic injury and the wide availability of CT in the emergency setting, it is strongly recommended for the diagnosis of significant blunt traumatic aortic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a valuable alternative in the assessment of hemodynamically unstable ventilated patients who require prompt assessment at bedside. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury#H933011299\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>TEE is a powerful imaging modality for the diagnosis of traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) located in the region of the aortic isthmus. In experienced hands, the sensitivity and specificity of TEE ranges between 91 and 100 percent and between 98 and 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/7,13,17,21,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,17,21,24,25</a>]. The reliability of TEE in the diagnosis of TAR involving the aortic isthmus requires meticulous examination by an experienced echocardiographer. The diagnostic accuracy of TEE for the identification of TAR involving other aortic segments is less known. TEE may allow diagnosis of blunt injuries to the ascending aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Traumatic injuries to aortic branches are usually outside the field of view of TEE probes.</p><p>TEE and CT have similar diagnostic accuracies for the identification of subadventitial injuries of the aortic isthmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Multidetector CT (MDCT) with 3D reconstruction has replaced helical CT in series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. TEE appears more sensitive than CT for the diagnosis of superficial traumatic thoracic aortic injuries and for the detection of associated cardiac trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or TEE can help clarify the diagnosis when thoracic CT is abnormal or equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus/abstract/11,22,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22,30</a>].
