Work-exacerbated asthma (also known as work-aggravated asthma) is defined as preexisting or concurrent asthma that worsens in the workplace, but is not induced by it.</p><p>The agents that cause OA include both immunologic and nonimmunologic stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Immunologic OA is the classic form of OA in which the worker's immune system is sensitized to an occupational agent through IgE-mediated or other immune recognition. Similar to asthma in general, immunologic OA appears to be heterogeneous and includes several phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The term nonimmunologic OA is used to refer to irritant-induced asthma that results from single or multiple exposures to irritant substances at a high level of intensity. Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), is a form of irritant-induced asthma, acutely induced by accidental high level irritant exposures in the workplace (eg, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, smoke inhalation).</p><p>The diagnosis of immunologic OA is based on the occurrence of new adult-onset asthma or worsening of previously quiescent asthma following an initial occupational exposure to a causative agent, evidence of reversible airflow obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> airway hyperresponsiveness (based on pulmonary function testing), and demonstration of respiratory sensitization to a potential causative agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Demonstration of allergic sensitization (particularly to protein allergens encountered at work) by skin prick testing or serum specific IgE supports the diagnosis of immunologic OA. The diagnosis of irritant induced asthma (eg, RADS) is made retrospectively based on the onset of cough <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asthma symptoms following high-intensity irritant exposure(s) and demonstration of a positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge test. &#160; &#160; </p><p>The management, prognosis, and prevention of OA will be reviewed here.

Occupational asthma (OA) may be cured if this is done rapidly and efficiently. The management of OA requires a combination of avoidance of further exposure to sensitizing agents, reduction in exposure to irritant agents (eg, environmental tobacco smoke, strong fumes and fragrances, extremes of temperature and humidity) and pharmacotherapy based on the severity of asthma. The management of occupational rhinitis, which may accompany OA, is discussed separately.

Patients with OA generally have progressive deterioration in lung function if they remain in the working environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], and fatal cases have occurred among workers with ongoing workplace exposure to either high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight provocative antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A description of high and low-molecular-weight agents is provided separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66185 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors#H1191269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Definitions, epidemiology, causes, and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Causative agents'</a>.)</p><p>Systematic reviews that assessed the outcome of immunologic OA indicate that complete and definitive removal from exposure to the causal agent is the optimal treatment for immunologic OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Workers with immunologic OA who remain exposed to their causal agent are at high risk of experiencing asthma exacerbations. Workers with persistent OA may develop bronchospasm with exposure to nonspecific asthma triggers due to bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Thus, the management plan should also include avoidance of other asthma triggers (eg, environmental tobacco smoke, extremes of heat and cold) at and away from work. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-control-to-enhance-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger control to enhance asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111259\"><span class=\"h3\">Irritant-induced asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Workers with nonimmunologic, irritant-induced asthma may be able to continue to work if the risk of a high-level exposure to the inciting agent is reduced by use of appropriate engineering controls and respiratory protective devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Due to the irritant nature of the inciting agent, low dose exposures are less likely to cause an increase in symptoms, compared with immunologic inciting agents. Chronic exposure to irritant agents may contribute to work-related asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and irritant-induced asthma&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111266\"><span class=\"h3\">Work-exacerbated asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For workers with work-exacerbated asthma, avoidance of asthma triggers both at work and away from work (eg, environmental tobacco smoke, extremes of heat and cold) is important together with the use of appropriate medications to control asthma symptoms. In general, as long as these goals are achieved, the worker need not change jobs or leave the work environment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-control-to-enhance-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger control to enhance asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953617198\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reducing exposure to the causal agent represents a substantially less satisfactory approach in terms of respiratory outcome, compared with complete avoidance or removal. This issue has been examined in two systematic reviews. In one systematic review, a reduction in exposure was associated with a lower likelihood of improvement or resolution of asthma symptoms and a higher risk of worsening of the symptoms and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness compared with complete avoidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the other systematic review, reduction of exposure increased the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, but did not affect forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>); removal from exposure was associated with an increased risk of unemployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Some workers with OA, often those with milder symptoms, may choose not to leave their workplace due to concerns about a reduction of income with job reassignment or unemployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Ongoing surveillance is advised for workers with OA who have continued low level exposure to a known causative agent. Evidence of further deterioration in asthma control or lung function should lead to renewed recommendations for complete avoidance of exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111823\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory protection devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Engineering and work practice controls are generally regarded as the most effective methods to control exposures to airborne hazardous substances. However, as an alternative, several respiratory protection devices (RPDs) are available to help protect workers from noxious occupational inhalants. These devices include air-purifying masks that filter particulates (eg, dust or particulate respirators) or chemically remove vapors or gases (eg, masks with cartridges or canisters) and powered air purifying respirators (also known as personal powered respirators, or PPRs) that supply clean air. The particular device is chosen based on the characteristics of the causative agent. These devices require proper fitting, careful removal practices, and regular maintenance. Patients with impaired pulmonary function at baseline may not tolerate the extra work of breathing resulting in suboptimal compliance with these devices. Further work is needed to evaluate efficacy with long-term use in the workplace.</p><p>Data in support of using RPDs to reduce exposure to an agent known to have caused OA are limited to a few small case series that found only partial protection when the RPD was used in workers with OA due to high-molecular-weight agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of a dust respirator (such as an N95 mask) was examined in two workers with OA due to buckwheat or wheat flour, one with only a late phase reaction and one with both early and late onset of asthma symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Both early and late reactions were suppressed when the dust respirator was worn during workplace exposure.

The PPR blunted the increase in airway resistance following dust exposure, but did not entirely prevent it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal powered respirators (PPR) were evaluated in 24 agricultural workers with OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates and daily symptoms of the subjects were monitored for 3 months without and for 10 months with the PPR. Morning peak flow rate improved with the PPR and daily variation in the peak flow rate diminished, consistent with improved asthma control. Occupational rhinitis also improved with use of the PPR. In a separate study, eight patients with OA due to laboratory animal allergy wore a PPR (Racal Airstream) during workplace exposure for seven weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Six of the eight patients had adequate protection based on peak flow readings and a symptom diary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A laminar flow helmet with a high efficiency air purifying (HEPA) system was tested in 10 subjects with latex-induced OA, during challenges that simulated work exposure to latex gloves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The helmet with HEPA filtration was effective in preventing the asthma symptoms and fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> that occurred during challenges without the helmet. However, it is not known whether this type of protection would be adequate protection against exposure to other high-molecular-weight causative agents in a work environment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive pressure helmets can be used by workers with OA caused by low-molecular-weight agents, if the duration of exposure is short. However, these protective devices are cumbersome and not well tolerated for longer intervals such as a work shift.</p><p/><p>Further study is needed to determine whether any form of respirator would adequately prevent inhalation of a causative agent, such that a worker with OA could continue working in the same workplace.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H293008866\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic treatment of OA is essentially the same as for non-occupational asthma, although it cannot replace exposure prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

The assessment of OA severity follows the same principles described by national and international guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], and is based on the severity and frequency of asthma symptoms, the anticipated risk of future exacerbations, and the degree of impairment of pulmonary function tests such as the FEV<sub>1</sub> and the ratio of the FEV<sub>1</sub> to the forced vital capacity (FVC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58247 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

A brief summary of this approach is described here; a more detailed discussion is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic treatment'</a>.)</p><p>For all workers with OA, a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) is prescribed for use as needed for quick relief of symptoms. For workers with mild, intermittent OA, this is usually the only pharmacologic therapy needed, especially if the worker is removed from further exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58247 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intermittent and mild persistent asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Medications for intermittent asthma'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with mild, moderate, or severe persistent OA, regular use of an inhaled glucocorticoid is added to &quot;as-needed&quot; use of the inhaled SABA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58247 \">table 2</a>). The evidence for the efficacy of inhaled glucocorticoids in OA is extrapolated from the large body of evidence supporting their use in non-occupational asthma, and also from a few studies of patients with OA. When initiated shortly after diagnosis (in addition to removal from exposure), inhaled glucocorticoids have been found to produce a small but significant improvement in symptoms, lung function, and quality of life among patients with OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In the largest study, which started within three months of cessation of exposure, 32 subjects with OA caused by high or low-molecular-weight compounds were randomly assigned to take inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a> 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. After one year, significant improvements were noted symptoms, morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates, and quality of life in the treatment group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intermittent-and-mild-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intermittent and mild persistent asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Medications for mild persistent asthma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-moderate-persistent-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of moderate persistent asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Initiating controller therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The initial dose of the inhaled glucocorticoid depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms, and also the degree of asthma control achieved with a prior dose of inhaled glucocorticoid, if any (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58247 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78011 \">table 3</a>). For those who do not achieve good asthma control with a moderate to high dose of inhaled glucocorticoid, an inhaled long-acting beta2- adrenergic (LABA) bronchodilator is added to the regimen, based on the NAEPP and GINA guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] and clinical experience rather than data from subjects with OA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68143 \">table 4</a>).

In addition, patients with severe asthma due to an occupational sensitizer should be removed from the workplace; continued exposure may reduce response to pharmacotherapy or trigger severe life-threatening exacerbations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of severe asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Initiating controller therapy'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The optimal duration of pharmacologic therapy for OA is unknown. We typically re-assess asthma control at 8 to 12 week intervals. When asthma control is achieved, we taper the controller medications based on perceived efficacy, presence of adverse effects, patient preference, and cost considerations. Guidelines for tapering of inhaled GCs have not been validated, but we usually decrease by 20 to 25 percent increments at one to three month intervals to a medium or low dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H839256\"><span class=\"h3\">Subcutaneous immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is occasionally administered to workers with OA who are unable or unwilling to change their work environment and are sensitized to high-molecular-weight agents for which appropriate allergen extracts are available. However, supportive data are limited, particularly regarding ongoing high level exposure, such as that experienced in a workplace. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease: Indications and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease: Indications and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Allergic asthma'</a>.)</p><p>The evidence supporting the use of SCIT for OA comes from a few small studies of SCIT with high-molecular-weight antigens. As examples, two randomized trials have tested SCIT among patients with cat or dog dander-induced asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In one trial, 28 subjects were assigned to cat allergen SCIT or control and noted a marked reduction in symptoms during subsequent cat exposure without any significant adverse reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In the other trial, SCIT improved symptoms related to cat exposure but not to dog exposure. Subsequent studies have confirmed that dog SCIT requires a high maintenance dose to achieve benefit, so the absence of benefit to dog SCIT in this study may have been due to an insufficient dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease: Indications and efficacy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two randomized trials of SCIT administered for OA involved healthcare workers sensitized to natural rubber latex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. After specific SCIT, a significant improvement was observed in tolerance to direct exposure (glove-use test), but not in other parameters of asthma control, such as symptom scores, use of medication, or bronchial reactivity. Systemic reactions occurred in 69 percent of patients and after 8 percent of the doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other case series have supported the efficacy of SCIT with latex extract, but also found a high rate of systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/33,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35,36</a>]. However, SCIT is no longer a consideration for latex OA, as workplace practices to reduce latex exposure have subsequently improved to the point that SCIT is not needed.

However, it is considered experimental therapy for OA, pending additional research on efficacy and safety. When caring for a patient with poorly-controlled OA, the strong recommendation would be for complete avoidance of the causative agent, rather than anti-IgE therapy. (See <a href=\"#H111252\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic occupational asthma'</a> above.)</p><p>The use of anti-IgE therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>) has been described in a few patients who had poorly controlled asthma despite guideline-based pharmacologic therapy and were unable to change their work environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. In the largest series, 10 patients with severe, uncontrolled OA due to high and low molecular weight agents were treated with anti-IgE therapy and concomitant reduction in workplace exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Nine patients exhibited lower rates of exacerbation and a reduced requirement for oral or inhaled glucocorticoids, although two of these eventually left the workplace. As the study was not controlled, the relative contributions of workplace modifications and anti-IgE therapy to the observed improvement in asthma control are not known. A mouse model of OA to persulfate salts suggests that anti-IgE may be beneficial in OA caused by LMW agents such as persulfate salts. Studies need to be conducted in humans to confirm these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Prior to considering anti-IgE therapy for OA, it would be necessary to document elevated serum total IgE and specific IgE to the causative workplace allergen.

However, a shorter duration of exposure prior to removal from the workplace appears to correlate with a higher rate of resolution of sensitization and bronchial hyperresponsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. In a systematic review of OA studies with a median duration of follow-up of 31 (range 6 to 240)&#8197;months, bronchial hyperresponsiveness was persistent in approximately 73 percent (95% CI 66-79 percent) of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Even if asthma control improves with complete avoidance of exposure to the sensitizing agent, approximately one-half of workers with OA have persistent problems with depression and anxiety that are more severe than patients with a similar severity of non-work-related asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H293008304\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Control of the level of exposure to workplace respiratory sensitizers can reduce the number of workers who become sensitized and is the most important method of primary prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/18,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,53</a>].

As an example, among 66 new hires at a plant using hexahydrophthalic anhydride, the use of RPE was associated with a decrease in the rate of developing occupational respiratory disease, including OA, from 10 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Exposure monitoring, combined with medical surveillance of exposed workers, enables early identification of sensitization and removal from exposure for those who develop OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-management-prognosis-and-prevention/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. Continuous monitoring of ambient levels of several low-molecular-weight chemicals, including isocyanates and formaldehyde, is now available. In addition, immunochemical techniques have been developed for quantifying ambient levels of high-molecular-weight allergens. Unfortunately, the very low concentration of antigen required to provoke bronchospasm once sensitization has occurred is often below the limits of detection.</p><p>Because of the low predictive value of atopy for the development of OA and because nearly 50 percent of young adults are atopic, atopic subjects should not be excluded from high-risk workplaces.
