A c-section, also called a &quot;cesarean delivery,&quot; is surgery to get a baby out of a woman's uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 3</a>). A vaginal birth after cesarean delivery is called a &quot;VBAC&quot; for short.</p><p>Years ago, doctors thought that after a woman had 1 c-section, she had to deliver all her other babies by c-section. That's because the uterus is cut open during a c-section. Even though the cut is stitched up and heals, doctors worried that the original cut could open up again when the woman went into labor. Doctors now know that this rarely happens. Many women can safely have a vaginal delivery after a c-section.</p><p>These days, a woman who had a c-section in the past usually has a choice about how she will deliver her other babies. She can either:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to go through labor and have a vaginal delivery &ndash; Doctors call this a trial of labor after cesarean, called &quot;TOLAC&quot; for short. A trial of labor might work and end with a VBAC. But sometimes it doesn't work, and the woman needs another c-section to deliver her baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plan to have another c-section before labor starts</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H873069804\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits of a VBAC?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of a VBAC include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shorter stay in the hospital after giving birth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less pain and a shorter recovery time (usually)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer problems after the delivery &ndash; Women who have a c-section have a higher chance of getting a fever, infection, blood clot in the legs, or needing blood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H873069819\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems might happen with a trial of labor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different problems can happen with a trial of labor. But the problem doctors and midwives worry about most is the uterus tearing. Doctors call this a &quot;uterine rupture.&quot; This is an emergency, and can cause harm to the mother and baby. If it happens, a c-section needs to be done right away to deliver the baby and fix the tear.</p><p>Plus, sometimes a trial of labor doesn't work. The labor might not progress normally and the baby might need to be delivered by c-section anyway. This can be upsetting and stressful for a woman.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H873069834\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to try and have a VBAC?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to try and have a VBAC, let your doctor or midwife know. Based on your individual situation, he or she will help you decide whether a trial of labor is a good choice for you.</p><p>In general, a trial of labor has the highest chance of working when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A woman had a vaginal delivery in the past (in addition to having a c-section).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first c-section was done because the baby was in a breech position. A breech position is when a baby's legs or buttocks (and not head) are closest to the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72643\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72643 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p>For some women, a trial of labor is not recommended. This happens when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterus was not cut open in the usual way during the previous c-section. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A uterine rupture (tear) happened in a past pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A vaginal birth isn't safe for the mother or baby.</p><p/><p>Plus, your doctor or midwife will only let you have a trial of labor in a hospital or center where a c-section could be done right away if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H873069849\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-tell-when-labor-starts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to tell when labor starts (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-delivery-vbac-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
