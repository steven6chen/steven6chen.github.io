It begins with inflammation around the bones in the spine or in some joints. Later, it can sometimes cause the bones in the spine to fuse together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23672465\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom is pain in the low back. This pain usually:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts in early adulthood, usually before the age of 45</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comes on slowly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lasts for more than 3 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is worse after resting, such as first thing in the morning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feels better with movement</p><p/><p>The back might also become less flexible. This can make it harder to do things like bend forward to put on socks or shoes. It can also lead to a &quot;hunchback&quot; posture over time.</p><p>Other symptoms might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or arthritis in other joints, such as the hips or shoulders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or swelling in other parts of the body, such as the elbows, heels, or ribs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired and not well</p><p/><p>In some cases, ankylosing spondylitis can lead to other problems, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation of part of the eye &ndash; This is called &quot;iritis&quot; or &quot;uveitis,&quot; and causes eye pain and blurry vision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the spinal cord &ndash; Ankylosing spondylitis makes it more likely that the bones in the neck or back will break. This can sometimes happen even from a very small fall or accident. If these bones break, the spinal cord can be injured.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the way the heart valves work</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing problems &ndash; Some people have stiffness between the ribs and spine. This can make it harder to breathe deeply and to exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation of the inside of the intestines, which usually does not cause any obvious symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23672480\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for ankylosing spondylitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no one test that can tell if you have ankylosing spondylitis. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms, doing an exam, and using imaging tests to look at your bones and joints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23672495\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can reduce the chance that your condition will cause problems if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking &ndash; If you smoke and have ankylosing spondylitis, you will be more likely to have breathing problems. Quitting smoking can help with this.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise &ndash; Exercise can help prevent some of the stiffness caused by ankylosing spondylitis. Follow your doctor's instructions for exercising and stretching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get plenty of calcium and vitamin D &ndash; This can help to keep your bones from getting weak.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a thin pillow &ndash; Sleeping on a thick pillow can cause neck problems in people with ankylosing spondylitis. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23672510\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ankylosing spondylitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms and how severe your condition is. The goal of treatment is to relieve your symptoms, help you do your normal activities, and keep your condition from causing other problems.</p><p>Exercise is an important part of treating ankylosing spondylitis. Some people work with a physical therapist (an exercise expert) to learn the best way to exercise. You might do stretches and gentle exercises to strengthen your muscles. It is especially important to work on your posture. That's because ankylosing spondylitis can cause the head to tilt forward in a &quot;hunchback&quot; posture. Special exercises can help prevent this. </p><p>Many people with ankylosing spondylitis also take one or more medicines. These might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs &ndash; This is a large group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn). These medicines can help relieve pain and stiffness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines &ndash; There are other medicines that can help treat symptoms and keep ankylosing spondylitis from getting worse. Your doctor or nurse will decide which medicines are best for you.</p><p/><p>Surgery can help some people with severe ankylosing spondylitis. For instance, some people have hip replacement surgery to replace a bad hip joint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23672525\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ankylosing spondylitis can make it hard to do simple things, such as getting dressed, getting up from a sitting position, and looking from side to side. You might need help from family or friends.</p><p>If the bones in your spine have fused together, you could be at risk of serious neck or back injury. To reduce the chances that you will get hurt:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove loose rugs, electrical cords, and any clutter that could make you trip</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not drink a lot of alcohol or take sleeping pills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid contact sports and other activities that might cause injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always wear a seatbelt while riding in a car</p><p/><p>There are also support groups for people with ankylosing spondylitis. It can help to talk to other people who are going through similar things.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23672541\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reactive arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=axial-spondyloarthritis-including-ankylosing-spondylitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reactive arthritis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
