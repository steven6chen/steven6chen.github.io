It is one of the most common gynecologic emergencies and may affect females of all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The fallopian tube often twists along with the ovary; when this occurs, it is referred to as adnexal torsion. Prompt diagnosis is important to preserve ovarian <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tubal function and to prevent other associated morbidity. However, making the diagnosis can be challenging because the symptoms are relatively nonspecific.</p><p>Isolated torsion of the fallopian tube is less common, but may also occur and adversely impact tubal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Tubal torsion may occur either in the mid-portion of the tube itself or around the ligamentous supports of the tube. </p><p>Torsion of paratubal or paraovarian cysts may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>This topic will focus mainly on ovarian torsion, but isolated fallopian tube torsion and torsion of paratubal or paraovarian cysts will also be reviewed. An overview of the approach to an adnexal mass and to acute pelvic pain is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H327777\"><span class=\"h1\">RELEVANT ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ovary is suspended by the infundibulopelvic ligament (also referred to as the suspensory ligament of the ovary), and is not fixed, but may be positioned lateral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior to the uterus, depending upon the position of the patient. The infundibulopelvic ligament is a fold of the broad ligament that is attached laterally to the pelvic sidewall. The ovarian vessels, which originate in the upper abdomen, travel through the infundibulopelvic ligaments. Other support structures of the ovary include the utero-ovarian ligament, which attaches the ovary to the uterus, and the broad ligament, one area of which is the mesovarium.</p><p>The fallopian tubes are attached to the broad ligaments with a condensation of connective tissue called the mesosalpinx.</p><p>Ovarian and fallopian tube anatomy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy#H25506258\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical female pelvic anatomy&quot;, section on 'Adnexa'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H849034\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of torsion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When ovarian torsion occurs, the ovary typically rotates around both the infundibulopelvic ligament and the utero-ovarian ligament. The fallopian tube often twists along with the ovary; when this occurs, it is referred to as adnexal torsion.</p><p>In adults, an ovarian physiologic cyst (functional cyst, corpus luteum) or a neoplasm is the most likely factor to predispose to ovarian torsion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52066\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52066 \">table 1</a>). The presence of an ovarian mass makes it more likely for the ovary to rotate on the axis of the infundibulopelvic and utero-ovarian ligaments and to become fixed in a torsed position. As the size of the mass increases, the risk of torsion increases, until the mass becomes large enough to be fixed in place in the pelvis. In addition, masses that are fixed in place due to adhesions (eg, endometrioma, tuboovarian abscess) or malignancy appear to be less likely to torse. (See <a href=\"#H14908185\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian mass'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14908713\" class=\"local\">'Size'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14908739\" class=\"local\">'Benign versus malignant masses'</a> below.)</p><p>Ovarian torsion may also occur in patients with normal ovaries (no mass and not enlarged). The mechanism of torsion of normal ovaries is unclear. This has been found in patients of all ages, but particularly in premenarchal girls. The utero-ovarian ligament is normally elongated in the premenarchal girl and then shortens as girls mature through puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. One hypothesis of the etiology of adnexal torsion in children with normal ovaries is that the elongated utero-ovarian ligament facilitates ovarian torsion by permitting excessive ovarian movement, but this has not been proven. (See <a href=\"#H1942422\" class=\"local\">'Normal ovaries'</a> below.) </p><p>The right ovary appears to be more likely to torse than the left, possibly because the right utero-ovarian ligament is longer than the left <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> that the presence of the sigmoid colon in the left side of the colon may help to prevent torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Some data suggest that ovarian torsion may occur following strenuous exercise or a sudden increase in abdominal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of ovarian or tubal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rotation of the infundibulopelvic ligament causes compression of the ovarian vessels and impedes lymphatic and venous outflow and arterial inflow. However, the arterial supply to the ovary is not initially interrupted to the same degree as the venous drainage since the muscular arteries are less compressible than the thin walls of the veins. Continued arterial perfusion in the setting of blocked outflow leads to ovarian edema with marked ovarian enlargement and further vascular compression. Ovarian ischemia then occurs and can result in ovarian necrosis, infarction, and local hemorrhage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H327826\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete occlusion of the ovarian blood supply will ultimately result in loss of ovarian function and necrosis of the torsed tissues. Additional potential adverse effects are hemorrhage or peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. However, hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion or sepsis have rarely been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. The necrotic tissue will involute over time, but there may be pelvic adhesion formation, which can result in pelvic pain or infertility. </p><p>Unrecognized tubal torsion will result in loss of tubal function, and likely hydrosalpinx or necrosis with eventual resorption of the damaged tissue. </p><p>Intermittent adnexal torsion may occur, and may have few, if any, adverse effects if perfusion is not persistently compromised and, in the case of isolated tubal torsion, the tube is not damaged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of adnexal torsion is unknown. There are some data regarding the rate of torsion among patients presenting for gynecologic care to an acute care setting. In a classic report of a 10-year review of patients at a women's hospital, ovarian torsion accounted for 2.7 percent of emergency surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Torsion was the fifth most common surgical emergency, preceded by (in descending order) ectopic pregnancy, corpus luteum rupture with hemorrhage, pelvic inflammatory disease, and appendicitis. In a 10-year review of surgically treated adnexal masses, torsion accounted for 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The primary risk factor for ovarian torsion is an ovarian mass, particularly a mass that is 5 cm in diameter or larger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Many of the risk factors for ovarian torsion, therefore, are related to the likelihood of developing an ovarian cyst or neoplasm. Since many of these masses are associated with the reproductive cycle or reproductive hormones (eg, corpus luteum, ovulation induction), the risk of torsion is increased in women of reproductive age, during pregnancy, and in women undergoing ovulation induction for treatment of infertility. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14908185\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ovarian mass (physiologic cyst or neoplasm) is the primary risk factor for ovarian torsion. In three case series, each with 80 or more patients with ovarian torsion, 86 to 95 percent had an ovarian mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28</a>]. </p><p>Torsion usually occurs infrequently in premenarchal girls, but when an ovarian mass is present, torsion is a common complication. Torsion accounts for 20 to 30 percent of ovarian surgeries in the pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>]. As an example, in a 15-year retrospective series of girls age 19 years or younger (average age of 9 years), torsion was the indication for 97 of 328 (30 percent) of ovarian surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Similarly, when an ovarian mass is present in a fetus or neonate, there is an increased risk of ovarian torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As an example, a series of 12 of 66 fetuses with ovarian cysts followed with serial ultrasound examinations developed sonographic changes consistent with torsion while still in-utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, a series of 30 neonates with prenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts that persisted after birth found that 30 to 40 percent required surgical intervention due to torsion in the first weeks after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14908713\"><span class=\"h3\">Size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, torsion is most likely to occur when the ovary is 5 cm in diameter or larger. In three case series, each with 80 or more patients, 83 to 93 percent of torsed ovaries were 5 cm or larger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/24,25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,27</a>]. This represents an average; however, torsion may occur with a mass of any size. Although it has been postulated that very large ovaries are less likely to torse because the size impedes movement within the pelvis, the upper limit of size has not been defined. The wide range of sizes of ovarian masses that are in cases of torsion was illustrated in a series of 87 cases of torsion, in which ovarian size ranged from 1 to 30 cm (mean 9.5 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of torsion'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14908739\"><span class=\"h3\">Benign versus malignant masses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Torsion is more likely to occur with benign cysts or neoplasms rather than malignant lesions, possibly because malignant masses are more likely to be fixed in place. Case series have reported malignancy in 2 percent or fewer of cases of torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/25,28,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28,33</a>]. However, the rate of malignancy in a torsed ovary is higher among postmenopausal women; reports range from 3 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-39</a>]. This is likely because the overall rate of a malignant adnexal mass is highest in this population. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942422\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal ovaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to note that torsion may occur in the presence of normal ovaries, particularly in the pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In children under the age of 15 years, normal ovaries have been demonstrated in over 50 percent of patients with ovarian torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. As an example, one large series of patients with adnexal torsion reported that 23 of 103 patients (22 percent) had no identifiable adnexal lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another study, 12 of 22 patients under the age of 15 years with adnexal torsion had normal ovaries visualized at laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Asynchronous bilateral torsion of normal ovaries has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28078997\"><span class=\"h2\">Reproductive age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of cases of ovarian torsion occur in women of reproductive age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28</a>]. For example, in 10- to 15-year retrospective series at single institutions, the average age of a patient with torsion was in the late-20s to mid-30s and the majority of cases occurred between the ages of 20 and 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/27,28,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,33</a>]. </p><p>Ovarian torsion may occur in females of all ages, even fetuses and neonates, particularly if an ovarian mass is present, as noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/25,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,31,32</a>]. As an example, in a series of 216 cases of torsion, the age range was 3 months to 77 years (mean 29 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. There are no data to establish the incidence of torsion in premenarchal girls. (See <a href=\"#H14908185\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian mass'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian cysts and neoplasms in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, torsion appears to occur infrequently in postmenopausal women. As an example, in a series of 301 postmenopausal women with ovarian neoplasms, 19 (6 percent) had ovarian torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20600973\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of ovarian torsion, accounting for 10 to 22 percent of cases of torsion in series of 80 or more patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67110\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67110 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/27,28,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,33</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of torsion during pregnancy is uncertain; one five-year retrospective study reported 7 cases out of 4274 deliveries (0.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a series of 174 pregnant women with a persistent adnexal mass &ge;4 cm, the incidence of torsion was 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Torsion was most likely between 10 and 17 weeks of gestation, but occurred through term and the postpartum period. Ovarian masses 6 to 8 cm in diameter were more likely to undergo torsion than larger masses, although torsion occurred in women with masses that were 10 to 20 cm. Other series in pregnant women with an adnexal mass have reported a much lower incidence of torsion (1 to 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14908210\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovulation induction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovulation induction for treatment of infertility results in the formation of large ovarian follicular cysts and, in some patients, massive ovarian enlargement due to hyperstimulation.

However, the presentation may vary and many symptoms and signs that accompany torsion are also associated with other conditions. In addition, torsion may also occur in the absence of an adnexal mass. Thus, a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. This is of particular importance since torsion may result in the loss of ovarian function or other adverse sequelae.

This was suggested by a retrospective study (41 premenarchal girls, 208 postmenarchal patients) that found that premenarchal girls had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation and treatment and were more likely to present with diffuse pain, fever, restlessness, and a palpable pelvic mass than other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

The mass is typically an ovarian cyst or neoplasm, but the ovary may be diffusely enlarged (eg, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome). The likelihood of torsion is higher if the mass is 5 cm in diameter or larger. A paraovarian cyst may be associated with ovarian or tubal torsion or a paratubal cyst may torse around its own pedicle.

Some patients with torsion present with a slightly elevated heart rate or blood pressure, typically in association with severe pelvic pain. (See <a href=\"#H295765\" class=\"local\">'Fever'</a> above.) </p><p>An abdominal and pelvic examination should be performed. Findings on physical examination are variable. Most patients exhibit pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal tenderness, although tenderness on examination is absent in as many as one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/27,28,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,33</a>]. Tenderness may be localized to the side of an adnexal mass, if present, or may be diffuse. Similarly, a palpable pelvic mass may or may not be present. Peritoneal signs are present in a small number of patients, and should raise concern for adnexal necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H327826\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H850127\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A serum human chorionic gonadotropin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and electrolyte panel should be drawn. </p><p>Pregnancy testing with human chorionic gonadotropin is essential, since the risk of torsion is increased in pregnant women.

Also, knowledge of pregnancy status helps to guide management to ensure maternal and fetal safety. </p><p>In the setting of ovarian torsion, in rare cases, hemorrhage may result in anemia and adnexal necrosis may cause infection with associated leukocytosis. Laboratory abnormalities are absent in many patients and, when present, anemia or leukocytosis are nonspecific and do not contribute to establishing the diagnosis of torsion. However, if these laboratory findings are present in a patient with suspected torsion, they raise concern for severe adnexal damage.</p><p>There is no serum marker for the diagnosis of adnexal torsion.

Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan are not usually ordered for the evaluation for adnexal torsion, but the diagnosis may be made using those modalities in a patient studied for a different clinical indication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound is the initial imaging study of choice for patients with suspected ovarian torsion. Ultrasound is less expensive than CT and MRI, and its diagnostic performance is similar. Both a transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound should be obtained in most patients to visualize both abdominal processes and provide the best images of pelvic structures. </p><p>The sonographic findings that are associated with ovarian torsion are listed here and examples are shown in the images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F86199\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86199 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F86200\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86200 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. The presence of these findings varies across patients: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ovary that is rounded and enlarged compared with the contralateral ovary &ndash; This is due to edema and vascular and lymph engorgement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ovarian mass &ndash; While the ultrasound is being performed, it is often helpful to note whether the patient has tenderness associated with the mass. In torsion, the patient will have pain ipsilateral to the mass, and scanning with the vaginal probe in the region of the mass will elicit pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterogenous appearance of the ovarian stroma &ndash; This is due to edema and hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple small peripheral follicles (&ldquo;string of pearls&rdquo;) &ndash; This is thought to be due to displacement by edema. This feature is also seen in polycystic ovarian syndrome, although in polycystic ovaries, the stroma is echogenic centrally, the ovary does not appear edematous, and the patient does not have acute pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal ovarian location &ndash; The normal location of the ovaries is lateral to the uterus, but in torsion, they may be located anterior to the uterus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased or absent Doppler flow within the ovary &ndash; Diminished or absent ovarian vessel flow on two-dimensional, color, and three-dimensional Doppler ultrasound has been proposed as a test for ovarian torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/14,66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,66-69</a>]. Since the ovary has a dual blood supply, flow can be present even in the presence of torsion. Arterial flow in systole without flow in diastole is evidence for outflow obstruction. Venous flow in the setting of torsion is associated with ovarian viability. It is helpful when performing sonography for torsion to ensure that Doppler flow settings are set appropriately by obtaining flow tracings in the contralateral ovary prior to examining the symptomatic ovary.<br/><br/>In a prospective study of 199 patients with an adnexal mass in the setting of pelvic pain, absence or impaired ovarian venous flow on Doppler ultrasound was found to have 100 percent sensitivity and 97 percent specificity for a diagnosis of ovarian torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In contrast, a retrospective study of 78 patients who underwent laparoscopy for presumed torsion reported that abnormal Doppler flow had a sensitivity and specificity of 43 and 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler grayscale &ldquo;whirlpool sign&rdquo; in the ovarian vessels &ndash; This is visualized as a round hyperechoic structure with concentric hypoechoic stripes or a tubular structure with internal heterogeneous echoes. This sign is thought to represent the twisting of the vascular pedicle. Two small series of 20 patients with suspected torsion found this sign to have a sensitivity of 90 percent or higher for the diagnosis of torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. Further study is needed to determine the usefulness of this sign in patients who present with pelvic pain.</p><p/><p>The reported sensitivity of ultrasound for the diagnosis of ovarian torsion ranges from 46 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/65,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,74</a>]. As an example, in one series of 63 patients with suspected torsion, the most sensitive sonographic findings were the following: ovarian edema (sensitivity 85.1 percent and specificity 18.8 percent), abnormal ovarian blood flow (85.1 and 37.5 percent), and relative enlargement of ipsilateral ovary (85.1 and 18.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. A specificity of 100 percent was achieved by combining two or more findings, although the highest sensitivity was approximately 55 percent when two or more findings were combined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H618574293\"><span class=\"h3\">Other imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI may be helpful if findings on ultrasound are equivocal, but the cost and time required for MRI does not justify its routine use for the evaluation of suspected adnexal torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/75-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-80</a>]. MRI findings consistent with ovarian torsion include an enlarged, edematous ovary in an abnormal location and, with contrast enhancement, the coiled ovarian vessels may be visualized with the &ldquo;whirlpool&rdquo; sign. </p><p>CT is not typically used for the evaluation of ovarian torsion, but a woman with acute abdominal or pelvic pain may undergo CT as an initial study (eg, to exclude appendicitis). Similar to MRI, findings on CT that are consistent with torsion include an enlarged, edematous ovary in an abnormal location, lack of enhancement of the ovary after administration of intravenous contrast, and coiled ovarian vessels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H850001\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive diagnosis of ovarian torsion is made by direct visualization of a rotated ovary at the time of surgical evaluation. </p><p>The decision to proceed with surgery is based upon a clinical diagnosis made with a combination of symptoms, signs, and ultrasound findings. A presumptive diagnosis of torsion can be made with a fair degree of confidence in the presence of acute pelvic pain and an adnexal mass with a sonographic appearance consistent with torsion and after exclusion of ectopic pregnancy, tuboovarian abscess, and appendicitis. Additional findings, such as nausea, fever, and pelvic tenderness on examination further support the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> above and <a href=\"#H850103\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>The decision to proceed with surgery, however, must often be made in the absence of some of these clinical features. It is important to note that the absence of an adnexal mass does not exclude a diagnosis of torsion. Torsion may occur in patients with ovaries with no underlying lesion, particularly in premenarchal patients, as noted above. (See <a href=\"#H1942422\" class=\"local\">'Normal ovaries'</a> above.)</p><p>The difficulty in diagnosis was illustrated in a series of 115 cases of adnexal torsion that revealed that the correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only 38 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H850103\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of ovarian torsion includes other conditions that present in a similar manner. </p><p>In a woman with acute pelvic pain and an adnexal mass, ectopic pregnancy, a ruptured ovarian cyst, and tuboovarian abscess should be excluded. A negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin excludes ectopic pregnancy. </p><p>In pregnant women, sonographic evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy decreases the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy (but does not exclude heterotopic pregnancy). If it is too early in pregnancy to visualize an intrauterine gestation, the two conditions are typically differentiated by risk factors, symptoms and ultrasound findings. Patients with either ectopic pregnancy or ovarian torsion may have pelvic pain, an adnexal mass, and nausea. However, the onset of the pain is typically followed shortly by nausea in torsion. In addition, ectopic pregnancy is usually associated with vaginal bleeding, while torsion is usually not. Either condition requires urgent intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rupture of an ovarian cyst is often accompanied by sonographic evidence of hematoperitoneum or free fluid in the pelvis; free fluid may also be seen with torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In addition, the classic history of cyst rupture is the sudden onset of pelvic pain at midcycle, often following sexual intercourse. Symptom patterns and ultrasound findings vary for both conditions, and may appear similar. When the patient has pain with associated fluid, the distinction between a ruptured cyst and torsion may be difficult. If torsion is suspected, surgical evaluation should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tuboovarian abscess is more likely to have an indolent course and be associated with fever than torsion, and the characteristic sonographic appearance of an abscess is a complex, multilocular mass, which is not usually found in torsion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H2457328\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of women with suspected toa'</a>.)</p><p>Appendicitis is another etiology of pelvic pain, nausea, and fever that may be difficult to differentiate from adnexal torsion. Currently, these two conditions are differentiated by the patient&rsquo;s symptoms, physical examination to localize the pain, and by the presence of characteristic imaging findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. Use of biomarkers has been proposed to differentiate between these two clinical entities. As an example, a prospective study of over 300 women ages 6 to 21 years with pelvic pain reported that serum IL-6 was elevated in women who underwent surgery, and that serum CD64 levels were significantly higher in patients with appendicitis compared to those with ovarian torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. These results are investigational, and further study is needed before they can be applied clinically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pattern of pain associated with ovarian torsion is variable, and thus, the differential diagnosis also includes other conditions that are associated with acute or chronic pelvic pain, including an ovarian cyst or neoplasm that is not torsed, endometriosis, or a degenerating leiomyoma.

Most torsed ovaries are considered potentially viable, unless there is a clearly necrotic appearance. &#160;</p><p>A laparoscopic approach is typically used, unless there is a suspicion of ovarian or fallopian tubal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/33,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,85</a>]. Surgical treatment should be performed by a gynecologist, whenever possible, for optimal evaluation of the ovary. In children, if a gynecologic pediatric surgeon is not available, an intraoperative consultation from a gynecologist should be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

Ovarian conservation is the preferred approach for premenopausal women, and most ovaries should be considered viable unless there is a high degree of certainty that the ovary is not viable due to the presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">necrotic/gelatinous</span> tissue. &#160;</p><p>The standard approach to determining the viability of a torsed ovary is gross visual inspection. An ovary that is dark and enlarged likely has vascular and lymphatic congestion and may have hemorrhagic lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61891%7EOBGYN%2F72645\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61891 graphicRef72645 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Traditionally, ovaries with this appearance have been thought to be nonviable, but multiple studies have found that many women (even those with an ovary that is blue or black) retain ovarian function following detorsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/85,87-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,87-94</a>]. In studies with ultrasound follow-up, the rate of follicular development after detorsion was 80 percent or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/79,90,93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,90,93,94</a>]. As an example, in a study of 40 women with ovarian torsion who had a &ldquo;bluish-black&rdquo; appearance of the ovary at surgery and underwent detorsion, normal follicular development was demonstrated on ultrasound in 35 of 37 patients who were followed after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. A possible explanation of the viability of ovarian tissue, based upon rat data, is that total arterial occlusion may not be present in the torsed ovary despite venous and lymphatic congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>Rarely, ovarian or tubal necrosis are present at time of surgery. The appearance on gross inspection of a necrotic ovary or tube includes a loss of normal anatomic structure and a gelatinous or friable consistency. </p><p>Other approaches have been proposed to assess whether ovarian perfusion is present, but these are investigational. One technique is ovarian bivalving, in which the ovary is untwisted and the ovarian cortex incised. In our practice, we make the incision with a laparoscopic instrument with an electrosurgical &ldquo;L-hook&rdquo; needle tip attachment. This method allows visualization of whether blood flow is present at the incision. In addition, there is a potential therapeutic effect by relieving the increased pressure exerted by the lymphatic and venous congestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52835%7EOBGYN%2F65607%7EOBGYN%2F78492\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52835 graphicRef65607 graphicRef78492 \">picture 2A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>]. This approach was reported in one series of five patients who underwent bivalving, four of whom had normal postoperative follicular development documented by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Another approach that has been reported is intraoperative intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> injection followed by direct visualization of the affected ovary under ultraviolet light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. However, this approach requires specialized equipment and its efficacy has not been validated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of treatment of ovarian torsion is swift operative evaluation to preserve ovarian function and prevent other adverse effects (eg, hemorrhage, peritonitis, adhesion formation). For most premenopausal patients with ovarian torsion, we recommend detorsion and ovarian conservation rather than salpingo-oophorectomy. Ovarian cystectomy is often performed if a benign mass is present. Patients with an ovarian mass that is suspicious for malignancy require salpingo-oophorectomy. Ovaries that are hemorrhagic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> edematous are most likely viable and, thus, oophorectomy should be reserved for <span class=\"nowrap\">necrotic/gelatinous/dead</span> tissue. Salpingo-oophorectomy is also reasonable for postmenopausal women. &#160;</p><p>Historically, salpingo-oophorectomy on the affected side had been the standard treatment of a torsed ovary because it was believed that conserving the ovary would leave behind necrotic tissue and restoring normal anatomy via detorsion could dislodge a clot in the ovarian vein and result in an embolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. However, it appears that detorsion is associated with continued ovarian function in many women, based upon multiple observational studies, as discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/87-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-91</a>]. </p><p>The key factor is to perform detorsion as quickly as possible. A study in rats found that necrosis occurred after occlusion of the ovarian vessels for 36 hours or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Consistent with the increasing risk of ovarian ischemic damage over time, the rate of ovarian conservation reported in studies decreases with an increasing interval between symptoms to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/41,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,92</a>].</p><p>There is also no evidence of an increase of adverse events with detorsion. In the only comparative data, a retrospective study of 94 women under age 40 years with ovarian torsion, there was no increase in postoperative complications in those who underwent detorsion with cystectomy compared with salpingo-oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. No pulmonary embolic events were identified in either group. In addition, a case report and review of the literature described 981 cases of torsion in which 309 were managed with detorsion and 672 with adnexal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Two pulmonary embolisms were observed in the adnexal resection group, and none in the detorsion group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H329640\"><span class=\"h2\">Premenopausal patients with a viable ovary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In premenopausal patients, the surgical evaluation is performed. Following detorsion, the adnexa is assessed for the presence of an ovarian cyst or neoplasm. If a mass is present and there is no suspicion of malignancy, a cystectomy is performed. If malignancy is suspected, a salpingo-oophorectomy should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H329352\" class=\"local\">'Surgical evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a nonviable ovary, suspected malignancy, or postmenopausal patients'</a> below.)</p><p>The evaluation and management of an ovarian cyst or neoplasm is discussed in detail separately.

During laparoscopy, this can be accomplished with a blunt probe or an atraumatic grasper. If laparotomy is performed, the ovary can be untwisted manually. </p><p>While the benefits of conservative surgery appear to outweigh the theoretical surgical risks of detorsion, irreversible ischemic damage to the adnexa can occur and may lead to infection if a necrotic ovary is retained. Postoperative care and instructions following detorsion should include observation for signs of peritonitis or sepsis (fever, abdominal pain, peritoneal signs, hemodynamic instability). This rare complication was reported in a pregnant patient who underwent laparotomy and detorsion of a hyperstimulated ovary with reperfusion of the torsed adnexa observed intraoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Reexploration because of peritonitis two days postoperatively revealed clear evidence of a necrotic ovary.

These results are often not available for patients who require urgent surgery, so decisions regarding salpingo-oophorectomy should be made based upon the available information. In a premenopausal patient, the ovary should be preserved unless there is a high clinical suspicion of malignancy. In contrast, in the rare postmenopausal woman with an ovarian mass, salpingo-oophorectomy is the preferred approach.</p><p>Intraoperatively, the adnexa should be detorsed to better visualize the mass. In addition, this allows better delineation of the infundibulopelvic ligament and location of the ureter to avoid surgical complications. The adnexa is then removed in the usual fashion.

Torsion of the midportion of the fallopian tube causes compression of the tissue and may result in ischemic or traumatic tubal injury. Tubal injury caused by torsion, similar to injury resulting from infection or adhesive disease, may result in an adverse effect on fertility.

It is one of the most common gynecologic emergencies. The fallopian tube often twists along with the ovary; when this occurs, it is referred to as adnexal torsion. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian torsion occurs in all age groups, but the majority of cases occur in women of reproductive age. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary risk factor for ovarian torsion is an ovarian mass and is most common if the ovary is 5 cm or larger. However, torsion may also occur without an underlying lesion, particularly in the pediatric population. (See <a href=\"#H14908185\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian mass'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic presentation of ovarian torsion is the acute onset of pelvic pain, often with nausea and possibly vomiting, in a woman with an adnexal mass. The presentation is variable (eg, the pain may be chronic, some patients present without an adnexal mass, a low grade fever may be occasionally present). (See <a href=\"#H327710\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic ultrasound is the first line imaging study for patients with suspected ovarian torsion. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis of ovarian torsion is made by direct visualization of a rotated ovary at the time of surgical evaluation. The decision to proceed with surgery is based upon a clinical diagnosis, which is often based upon the presence of acute pelvic pain and an adnexal mass with a sonographic appearance consistent with torsion, and after exclusion of other conditions. (See <a href=\"#H850001\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of ovarian torsion includes ectopic pregnancy, tuboovarian abscess, and appendicitis, as well as other conditions associated with acute or chronic pelvic pain. (See <a href=\"#H850103\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most premenopausal patients with ovarian torsion, we recommend detorsion and ovarian conservation rather than salpingo-oophorectomy, even in the case of a darkened, congested ovary (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Ovarian cystectomy is often performed if a benign mass is present. Patients with an obviously necrotic ovary or an ovarian mass that is suspicious for malignancy require salpingo-oophorectomy. Salpingo-oophorectomy is also reasonable for postmenopausal women. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1942783\" class=\"local\">'Assess ovarian viability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated torsion of the fallopian tube is uncommon, but may also occur and may result in an adverse impact on tubal function. Tubal torsion occurs most commonly in the mid-portion of the tube itself, but may also occur around the ligamentous supports of the tube. In addition, torsion of paratubal or paraovarian cysts may occur.
