Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dabigatran</a> (brand name: Pradaxa), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rivaroxaban</a> (brand name: Xarelto), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">apixaban</a> (brand name: Eliquis), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">edoxaban</a> (brand names: Savaysa, Lixiana), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betrixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">betrixaban</a> (brand name: Bevyxxa). These are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-direct-oral-anticoagulants-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Direct oral anticoagulants (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Medicines that help prevent clots are also known as &quot;anticoagulants,&quot; &quot;blood thinners,&quot; and &quot;anti-clotting medicines.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119193065\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor prescribe warfarin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main reasons doctors prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> are to prevent blood clots or to treat blood clots that have already formed. Nothing can completely prevent all blood clots, but anti-clotting medicines lower the risk of clots.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> does not dissolve clots, but it keeps them from growing bigger and moving to another part of the body.</p><p>Doctors prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> to prevent blood clots in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have a heart rhythm problem called &quot;atrial fibrillation&quot; &ndash; In people with this condition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> helps lower the chances of stroke from a blood clot forming in the heart and moving to the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have had hip or knee replacement surgery &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> helps prevent a blood clot in the legs (called a &quot;deep vein thrombosis&quot; or &quot;DVT&quot;) or the lungs (called a &quot;pulmonary embolism&quot; or &quot;PE&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have a mechanical heart valve &ndash; A mechanical heart valve is a device used to replace a damaged heart valve. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> helps prevent a blood clot from forming on the valve.</p><p/><p>Doctors also prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have had a blood clot in the legs or lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have had a stroke related to atrial fibrillation</p><p/><p>The goal is to lower the chances that the blood clot might get bigger or spread, and to lower the chances of new clots forming.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620790773\"><span class=\"h1\">What do I need to do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a>, there are certain things you should do, listed below. Getting your blood tested is especially important.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Know the amount of </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a><strong> you are supposed to take, what the pills look like, and why your doctor prescribed it for you</strong> &ndash; Warfarin pills come in different strengths. Each strength is usually a different color, with the amount of warfarin (in milligrams) printed on the tablet. If the color, shape, or dose of your warfarin pills looks different from those you have taken before, check with your doctor or pharmacist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Take your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to</strong> &ndash; Take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> at the same time each day and do not skip any doses. If you are getting your blood tested, your doctor might tell you to wait for the results before taking your dose that day. Do not change the dose or stop taking warfarin without talking to your doctor. Always refill your prescription before you run out of pills. If you forget or miss a dose, call your doctor to find out what to do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Use a weekly pill box</strong> &ndash; Some people find it helpful to use a weekly pill box. This can help you keep track of your <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a>, since sometimes you have to take a different amount depending on what day of the week it is. If you use a pill box, refill it at the beginning of every week with the amount of warfarin you are told to take each day. Also, you can check the pill box to see if you already took your pills that day. You can also bring the pill box with the warfarin pills inside it to your doctor's appointments or pharmacist so it can be checked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F113044\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113044 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Get your blood tested</strong> &ndash; When you start taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a>, you will need to have your blood tested often to check how your blood is clotting. This test is called a <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;PT/INR&quot;</span> or just &quot;INR.&quot; It is important in order to make sure you get the correct dose of warfarin for you. Your doctor will tell you how often to get a <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> blood test. This may change depending on how often your warfarin dose changes. If you missed any warfarin doses in the last week before your blood test, tell your doctor. Based on your blood test results, your doctor will tell you if you need to change your dose and when you will need the next blood test. Once you are on a regular dose, you do not need to have blood testing as often, unless your diet changes, you get sick, or you start a new medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ask your doctor before taking any new medicines</strong> &ndash; A <strong>lot</strong> of medicines can change the way <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> works, so tell your doctor about ALL of the medicines you take. That includes prescription or over-the-counter medicines, herbs, and vitamins. Do not take over-the-counter pain relievers or cough and cold medicines that have <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or an &quot;NSAID&quot; such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) without talking to your doctor first. Also, make sure every doctor who prescribes anything to you knows that you take warfarin. That way the doctor can check whether the new medicine might change the way warfarin works.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eat about the same amount of vitamin K each day</strong> &ndash; The amount of vitamin K you eat affects the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> you need. Some leafy greens and other vegetables are high in vitamin K and can make warfarin not work as well, if the amount you eat changes from day to day. You can eat these healthy foods, as long as you get similar amounts of vitamin K each day. That way, your vitamin K level will stay about the same, and warfarin can work as it should. This table shows you how to do this (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65279\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65279 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limit alcohol</strong> &ndash; If you drink alcohol, limit yourself to 1 to 2 servings per day. A serving is equal to 1 beer (12 ounces), 1 glass of wine (5 ounces), or 1 shot of liquor (1.5 ounces). Drinking a lot of alcohol at once or drinking often while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> increases your risk of bleeding. If you have more than 1 to 2 servings per day, talk to your doctor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>If you get sick, tell your doctor</strong> &ndash; If you get diarrhea, a fever, or an infection, or if you cannot eat, tell your doctor. These illnesses can change the way <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> works and you might need a blood test and a change in warfarin dose. If you can't eat much because you are sick, or you go on a diet, also let your doctor know.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wear a medical alert tag</strong> &ndash; Always wear a bracelet, necklace, or another kind of alert tag that warns people that you take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> and why. That way, if you are in an accident and are unable to explain your condition, people will know how to care for you. Your alert tag should also have the name and phone number of an emergency contact person.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>If you might be able to get pregnant, talk to your doctor</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> can harm an unborn baby. Use birth control if you might be able to get pregnant, and tell your doctor right away if you get pregnant while taking warfarin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620790468\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I switch to one of the newer anti-clotting medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people who take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> wonder if they could switch to one of the newer anti-clotting medicines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F99882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99882 \">table 2</a>). Each medicine is different, and there is no one right answer.
