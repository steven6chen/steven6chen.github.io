Patients with this disorder have excessive laxity of the joint capsule in more than one or in all directions (anterior, inferior, and posterior) and have difficulty maintaining the head of the humerus centered within the glenoid fossa.</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of MDI of the glenohumeral joint will be reviewed here. The general evaluation of adults with undifferentiated shoulder complaints, shoulder dislocation, and other common shoulder ailments, such as impingement or rotator cuff tendinopathy, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dislocation and reduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-impingement-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder impingement syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS: DISTINGUISHING LAXITY AND INSTABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the medical literature, a number of definitions exist for multidirectional instability (MDI) of the shoulder, making classification of these patients difficult. To clarify, glenohumeral laxity and instability are <strong>not</strong> synonymous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Instability implies dysfunction. It can be voluntary or involuntary, unidirectional or multidirectional, and traumatic or nontraumatic. Patients with ligamentous laxity often have no complaints and require no intervention, while those with instability are by definition symptomatic.</p><p>The distinction between laxity and instability applies to physical examination findings as well. A patient whose shoulder can be subluxated in one or multiple directions but is asymptomatic has laxity without instability and requires no intervention. In contrast, a patient who presents with shoulder or proximal upper extremity pain, weakness, fatigue, or paresthesias may have laxity with instability. Patients with MDI of the glenohumeral joint often have laxity in both the asymptomatic and symptomatic shoulder, but only the symptomatic shoulder is classified as having instability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4760044\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic anatomy and biomechanics of the shoulder complex are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multidirectional instability (MDI) of the glenohumeral joint may occur in patients with congenital joint laxity who have sustained repetitive minor injuries or one or more major injuries to the shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The incidence of generalized or asymptomatic joint laxity ranges from approximately 10 to 30 percent. Laxity in a single joint appears to be more common than generalized hypermobility. Joint laxity decreases steadily in boys but peaks around age 15 in girls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-hypermobility-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint hypermobility syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The precise incidence of MDI of the glenohumeral joint is unknown. Among sedentary individuals, the condition is more common in young women with poor muscular development and patients with large rotator cuff tendon tears, due to deficiencies in the muscles that stabilize the humeral head. MDI can develop in athletic or active individuals without generalized joint laxity, who participate in sports or work requiring repetitive overhead movements, such as gymnasts, tennis players, and throwers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Frequent overhead activity can lead to repetitive microtrauma of the structures that stabilize the glenohumeral joint.</p><p>However, the extent to which MDI accounts for shoulder problems in overhead athletes is not clear. According to a report based upon questionnaire results, the incidence of traumatic shoulder injuries among gymnasts is related to generalized ligamentous laxity but not MDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, although many observers believe that swimmers have increased glenohumeral laxity compared to non-swimmers, the literature on the subject is mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/4,7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-11</a>]. An observational study comparing elite and recreational swimmers reported that a combination of inherent and acquired factors contribute to greater glenohumeral laxity among elite swimmers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Another study of competitive swimmers found that male swimmers had greater joint laxity but younger females less than age and gender matched non-swimmer controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. An observational study using ultrasound measurements found no significant increase in glenohumeral joint displacement among 42 elite swimmers compared to non-swimmer age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the sport, MDI is more common in athletes under the age of 40. After the age of 40, the condition is uncommon due to the natural stiffening of tissues around the shoulder.</p><p>The asymptomatic shoulder of patients with MDI is frequently as mobile as the affected shoulder, suggesting that factors in addition to laxity are important in pathogenesis. These factors may include structural deformation, focal muscle weakness, and neuromotor dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Balance between the forces exerted upon the glenohumeral joint by the scapulothoracic stabilizers and the rotator cuff is important for maintaining normal function of the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some researchers speculate that imbalances in these forces can develop when an individual's arm fatigues from repetitive overhead activity or when the shoulder is forcefully traumatized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Examples of the former scenario might include repetitive minor trauma from pitching a baseball, swimming, or serving in tennis; examples of the latter scenario might include a tackle during a rugby or American football match that produces an anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint.</p><p>The initial inciting event, particularly repetitive overhead activity, frequently does not cause an identifiable episode of instability, but does produce pain, which leads the individual to guard the affected shoulder. Over time, such guarding results in muscle weakness and changes in neuromuscular coordination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This creates a vicious cycle whereby the patient becomes increasingly prone to shoulder instability and worsening pain as the shoulder becomes weaker and more dysfunctional.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of multidirectional glenohumeral instability are often vague and nonspecific unless the condition is preceded by specific trauma or complicated by subacromial impingement or rotator cuff pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The patient may complain of shoulder looseness or &quot;giving way,&quot; a noisy shoulder that &quot;pops&quot; or &quot;clicks,&quot; anterolateral shoulder pain, which is often similar to the pain associated with rotator cuff tendinopathy, or some combination of these symptoms. In addition to instability and pain, patients may complain of transient neurologic symptoms in the affected upper extremity, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and examination'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of shoulder instability tend to occur with glenohumeral motion, often during everyday activities, ultimately leading patients to avoid the extremes of glenohumeral motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Identifying the movements that precipitate symptomatic instability can provide insight into the patient's pathology. Patients who complain primarily of the shoulder &quot;slipping out&quot; when the arm is in a throwing position (shoulder abducted and externally rotated) most often have anterior instability. Symptoms, possibly including paresthesias, that occur when patients carry a heavy object at their side suggest inferior instability. Posterior instability is suggested by symptoms that develop when the shoulder is loaded posteriorly (eg, pushing against a heavy door, performing a push-up). Recurrent dislocations at night are characteristic of a severely decompensated shoulder (which is often less amenable to conservative management).</p><p>Patients who participate in repetitive overhead activities, such as swimming, gymnastics, tennis, or weight training may develop subacromial bursitis or rotator cuff impingement. Repetitive microtrauma from such impingement can lead to a pathologic chain of events eventually leading to multidirectional instability (MDI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-impingement-syndrome#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder impingement syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and examination'</a>.)</p><p>Sometimes, patients with MDI may be able to relate the onset of the problem to a specific traumatic event. However, the trauma that produces multidirectional glenohumeral instability is typically less severe, and therefore less memorable, than trauma that produces unidirectional shoulder instability from a major injury (eg, anterior shoulder dislocation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. More typically, patients either cannot recall an inciting event or the episode was trivial or involved a period of overuse or muscle fatigue.</p><p>Obtaining a detailed history is important as many patients with MDI have seen multiple doctors and been given multiple diagnoses. This is frequently the case with young patients with persistent symptoms following surgical repair of unidirectional shoulder instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These patients may present following significant shoulder trauma or may participate in a sport that predisposes them to MDI. They may complain of periods of fatigue or overuse associated with decreasing performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H226746145\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of approach and general shoulder examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the patient with multidirectional instability (MDI) of the glenohumeral joint requires a systematic approach. Particularly in patients with a history of trauma, it is important to examine the cervical spine and peripheral nerves to rule out referred pathology. Inspection of the shoulders, neck, and torso may reveal important findings, such as muscle asymmetry or atrophy, scapular winging, or surgical scars. The examination of the shoulder is complex and described in detail separately; a general approach and specific guidance related to MDI of the shoulder is described here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After visual inspection, ask the patient to demonstrate any voluntary instability or &quot;double jointedness,&quot; as many patients describe having this capacity. You may ask the patient to reach behind their head and touch their elbow to the opposite ear, or have them reach behind their back with one hand and over the opposite shoulder with the other and clasp hands. Some patients may be able to voluntarily subluxate or dislocate and relocate their shoulder. Such findings demonstrate increased laxity of the glenohumeral joint. </p><p>Next, assess the patient for any generalized ligamentous laxity. Patients with generalized laxity (predisposing them to shoulder instability) will demonstrate laxity in joints, such as the thumb (can extend and touch the forearm), elbow (hyperextension), or knee (excessive recurvatum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>]. The Beighton score is commonly used to evaluate hypermobility of the joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78462 \">table 1</a>). This score evaluates four joint maneuvers and the spine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-hypermobility-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint hypermobility syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following inspection and assessment of shoulder and generalized joint laxity, palpate the shoulder and surrounding structures. Palpation may reveal a step-off between the acromion and the humeral head in patients with MDI of the shoulder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H11044346\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Palpation'</a>.)</p><p>Assess glenohumeral range of motion looking in particular for limitations in active and passive motion, as well as pain or apprehension with testing. Remember to examine and compare shoulders. Scapular dysfunction is common among patients with MDI of the shoulder, and thus, it is important to perform a careful evaluation of scapular motion during shoulder abduction and flexion. The examination of glenohumeral and scapular movement are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H11044360\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Range of motion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H1181467\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Scapulothoracic motion and strength'</a>.)</p><p>Next, evaluate rotator cuff function and strength, including internal and external rotation and abduction. Testing for subacromial impingement (Hawkins and Neer tests), bicep tendinopathy (Speeds and Yergasons tests), and pathology at the acromioclavicular joint (cross body adduction test) is performed to rule out these alternative diagnoses.</p><p>Following the general shoulder examination, there are a number of specialized tests can be performed to help identify MDI. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4760758\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining the presence of instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, distinguishing between laxity and instability is central to diagnosing MDI of the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, provocative testing of the shoulder designed to elicit symptoms as well as detect joint instability is an important element of the physical examination. Remember to examine and compare both shoulders. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions: distinguishing laxity and instability'</a> above.)</p><p>The tests used to make the diagnosis of MDI include the sulcus sign, the load and shift test, and the apprehension and relocation tests. Patients with multidirectional shoulder instability generally manifest the signs described below in response to these tests. The techniques for performing these tests and their characteristics (eg, sensitivity) are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H11044487\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Special tests for shoulder instability'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sulcus sign</strong> &ndash; Inferior laxity is assessed with the sulcus sign. This sign is present when downward traction applied to the upper arm causes translocation of the humeral head inferiorly in the glenoid fossa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56542 \">picture 1</a>). Some patients demonstrate a voluntary sulcus sign by placing the hand of the affected arm under their bent leg and pulling upward, thereby creating a sulcus just below the acromion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H11044494\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Sulcus sign'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Load and shift test &ndash;</strong> This test measures anterior and posterior glenohumeral laxity. This test is positive if there is significant translocation of the humeral head anteriorly or posteriorly in the glenoid fossa when applying a force in the respective direction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H95588956\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Load and shift test'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Apprehension relocation test</strong> &ndash; Apprehension (more specific and sensitive for MDI than pain) when placing the glenohumeral joint at extremes of motion (generally external rotation and abduction) that is then relieved with pressure relocating it in the center of the glenohumeral joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69882\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69882 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H11044501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Apprehension, relocation, and release tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p>When performing these maneuvers, the examiner will often note varying degrees of crepitation (&quot;popping&quot; in the joint as it moves). Pain may also occur, but the site and timing of such pain varies depending upon the cause of shoulder instability and the presence of concomitant injury (eg, rotator cuff tendinopathy).</p><p>Positive results from tests assessing movement of the humeral head in relation to the glenoid, while useful in assessing joint laxity, are not necessarily predictive of shoulder instability. Positive findings with the apprehension, relocation, and anterior release tests more accurately predict subsequent arthroscopically evident instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H226746014\"><span class=\"h2\">Concomitant subacromial impingement or rotator cuff tendinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variable degrees of impingement or rotator cuff tendinopathy may accompany or contribute to shoulder instability. This can be assessed using the Neer test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76237\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76237 \">picture 3</a>), Hawkins-Kennedy test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60425 \">picture 4</a>), painful arc maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76168\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76168 \">picture 5</a>), and other appropriate tests of rotator cuff muscle function (supraspinatus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52038\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52038 \">picture 6</a>) and external rotators (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77117\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77117 \">picture 7</a>)).

However, it is reasonable to obtain these studies in patients with persistent pain to look for bony injuries or lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4761418\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several small clinical studies suggest that ultrasound is a reliable tool for assessing the degree of shoulder instability and may provide additional information when evaluating glenohumeral laxity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/5,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23,24</a>]. Ultrasound is also useful for identifying any associated rotator cuff pathology.

These studies are most commonly indicated in patients who fail to respond to conservative therapy, have persistent motion deficits, or manifest persistent crepitation with shoulder circumduction. CT is often used to study the bony architecture when glenoid abnormalities are identified on plain film [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. MRA is useful to identify capsular redundancy, labral injury, and rotator cuff pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H226746195\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of multidirectional glenohumeral instability is made clinically based upon a suggestive history and characteristic findings on physical examination. Shoulder looseness or weakness is a common complaint, particularly among young active individuals engaged in overhead activities and in sedentary patients with hypermobile joints. The prevalence of multidirectional instability (MDI) appears to be higher among patients who participate in overhead sports, such as gymnastics, volleyball, and tennis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Common examination features include glenohumeral joint instability and apprehension when the joint is placed in positions at the extremes of motion. The most useful tests to elicit these findings are the sulcus sign, load and shift test, and apprehension relocation test. Although the diagnosis is primarily clinical, plain radiographs may be helpful in some cases to rule out other pathology; specialized radiographic testing is rarely necessary. Note that MDI differs from unidirectional instability, which should be referred for assessment by an orthopedist. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and history'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic referral'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4760734\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for multidirectional instability (MDI) of the shoulder includes rotator cuff disease (tendinopathy or tear), subacromial impingement, unidirectional instability of the shoulder, cervical neuropathy, brachial plexopathy, and thoracic outlet syndrome. Although MDI of the shoulder can occur concomitantly with rotator cuff disease or impingement, the presence of MDI can usually be determined on the basis of a suggestive history (eg, repetitive overhead activity, sensation of shoulder giving way in particular positions, history of recurrent subluxation or dislocation) and examination findings of excessive glenohumeral motion, including focused testing of shoulder laxity (eg, positive sulcus sign, positive load and shift test, positive apprehension and relocation tests).</p><p>Patients with rotator cuff disease, impingement, or bursitis without MDI generally complain of pain with overhead activity but without the sensation of giving way. They may describe preceding trauma (possibly minor), pain at night, or weakness with daily activities involving the shoulder. Examination of the patient with impingement may reveal positive impingement signs (eg, Hawkins and Neer tests) but no abnormalities with the load and shift, sulcus, or apprehension relocation tests. Patients with significant rotator cuff tears may have positive painful arc and drop arm tests and weakness with testing of abduction, internal, or external rotation. Skilled practitioners can use ultrasound to help distinguish MDI from rotator cuff disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-impingement-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder impingement syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distinguishing unidirectional instability from MDI is important, as the former may do better with surgical intervention. In contrast to MDI where joint laxity is present in more than one direction and the patient often has global ligamentous laxity, the patient with unidirectional instability has laxity in only one direction with testing. An example would be a patient with a positive load and shift test only anteriorly following a traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation who has no signs of global ligamentous laxity. Unidirectional instability may reflect a labral tear. The presence of a labral injury is suggested by the history (eg, fall onto the shoulder, lifting a heavy object, traumatic dislocation, and overuse from overhead sports or heavy work) and positive provocative testing (eg, Active compression, Crank, and Speeds tests). Advanced imaging studies or possibly arthroscopy are required to make a definitive diagnosis.

Patients with either condition often have paresthesias in the affected upper extremity. Sensory deficits, atrophy of affected muscles of the shoulder girdle, and scapular winging may be present. In patients with cervical neuropathy, a Spurling's test may be positive. Although MDI patients with MDI frequently manifest some scapulothoracic dysfunction, the findings associated with neuropathy described here are generally absent.

Those who do not respond well to physical therapy may require surgical repair. Surgical options for stabilizing the glenohumeral joint in patients with MDI include open and arthroscopic capsular plication, rotator interval closure, and labral augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should initially be advised to rest and restrict overhead activities, such as reaching, pushing, pulling, and lifting. Daily applications of ice (15 minutes every four to six hours) and a short course (eg, two to three days) of antiinflammatory medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>) help to relieve pain in patients with concomitant bursitis or rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4761526\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rehabilitative exercise program that focuses on correcting scapulothoracic dyskinesia and strengthening the dynamic stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint is often effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/12,18,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,36</a>]. The goal is to improve the dynamic control and positioning of the humeral head in the glenoid. Precise data is lacking, but observational studies and abundant clinical experience suggests that most compliant patients have good results with an appropriate rehabilitation program, as determined by diminished pain and improved stability over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. When treating the overhead athlete, many clinicians incorporate stretching exercises into the rehabilitation program with the goal of maintaining a normal range of motion equal to the contralateral side, while correcting for the increased external rotation commonly seen in the dominant arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Once proper scapulothoracic control is achieved the program begins to incorporate rotator cuff strengthening exercises.

An example of one exercise progression that might be used in such a program consists of push-ups against a wall, followed by standard push-ups, and ultimately pushups on a tilt board. The instability created by the tilt board helps the patient to improve proprioception and dynamic joint stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

Nevertheless, referral to an orthopedic surgeon for consideration of surgical correction is warranted in patients with persistent pain or recurrent episodes of dislocation despite full participation in a well-designed physical therapy program for 6 to 12 months. Recurrent dislocation in particular must be managed appropriately to avoid the development of premature glenohumeral osteoarthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glenohumeral-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glenohumeral osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, patients with unidirectional (eg, posterior) shoulder instability, particularly those who are not improving with physical therapy, should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation. In many cases, the pathology responsible for unidirectional instability is amenable to surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Coordinated care by a team of specialists (eg, genetics, rehabilitation medicine, orthopedic surgery) is generally needed for patients with shoulder instability due to a connective tissue disorder, such as Ehlers Danlos or Marfan syndrome, since these individuals appear to be less responsive to standard conservative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/14,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,43</a>]. These patients are challenging surgically and frequently require activity and lifestyle modifications for a satisfactory outcome.

Conversely, patients with hypermobility syndromes (eg, voluntary dislocators) typically experience poor outcomes following surgery.</p><p>Surgical options include an open capsular repair and arthroscopic repair. The open procedure has historically been associated with a long-term success rate of 90 percent or better among appropriately selected patients. Arthroscopic techniques and technology have improved considerably and patients treated in this manner have a high rate of return to activity and sport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/31,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,45</a>]. With either technique, approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients lose some shoulder mobility in rotation or overhead reaching. A meta-analysis of studies of surgical management for multidirectional instability reported significantly higher recurrence rates for patients treated with thermal capsular shrinkage, suggesting that such treatment is best avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multidirectional-instability-of-the-shoulder/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H226745719\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence about methods to prevent injury due to shoulder laxity is scant.

This in turn causes recurrent episodes of shoulder instability and pain.
