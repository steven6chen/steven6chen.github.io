This topic will review the complications of chronic pancreatitis. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of chronic pancreatitis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PSEUDOCYSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudocysts develop in approximately 10 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis. They can be induced by an acute exacerbation of pancreatitis or occur as a result of ductal disruption. Pseudocysts are mature fluid collections, have a well-defined wall, and do not contain solid material or pancreatic necrosis. Most pseudocysts communicate with the pancreatic ductal system and contain high concentrations of digestive enzymes. The walls of pseudocysts are formed by adjacent structures such as the stomach, transverse mesocolon, gastrocolic omentum, and pancreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80720\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80720 \">image 1</a>).

They can, however, produce a wide range of clinical manifestations depending upon the location and extent of the fluid collection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expansion of the pseudocyst can produce abdominal pain, duodenal or biliary obstruction, vascular occlusion, or fistula formation into adjacent viscera, the pleural space, or pericardium.

Pancreatic pseudocysts may be seen on transabdominal ultrasound, but contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is typically obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to further classify the fluid collection. However, patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms may present with pancreatitis, so if the diagnosis is in doubt (eg, if no imaging from prior to the episode of pancreatitis or trauma is available for comparison), sampling of the cyst fluid may be necessary. The diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocysts and the differential diagnosis include a variety of other pancreatic cystic neoplasms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-pancreatic-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of pancreatic cysts&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis#H1654946402\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751078125\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of a pancreatic pseudocyst includes pancreatic cystic neoplasms, cystic degeneration of a solid pancreatic tumor, and rare non-neoplastic pancreatic cysts (eg, retention cysts).

Watchful waiting is an appropriate option in patients with walled-off pancreatic fluid collections with minimal or no symptoms and no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. Indications for drainage include abdominal pain, chills, jaundice, early satiety, or fever. Management options include radiologic imaging with percutaneous catheter drainage, endoscopic drainage, and surgery. The indications, risks, and benefits of these treatment options are discussed in detail separately.

Patients with bile duct obstruction may present with postprandial epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and jaundice.

However, these symptoms are not specific, and the initial evaluation begins with serologic testing and abdominal imaging. Additional testing is then directed based upon the findings of the initial testing as well as the patient's clinical presentation, prior diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, and risk factors for pancreatic cancer. The diagnostic approach to a patient with abdominal pain, early satiety, and jaundice and subsequent evaluation is discussed in detail, separately.

In addition, drainage should be performed if a pseudocyst is obstructing the bile duct. Decompression can reverse cirrhosis secondary to bile duct obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Endoscopic stenting is a temporizing measure as it frequently requires several stent changes. Patients with bile duct obstruction and concomitant duodenal obstruction from fibrosis in the pancreas and surrounding tissues require gastric bypass with gastrojejunostomy, but some patients require a more extensive resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy and duodenum preserving head resection).

Among patients who are symptomatic, upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastric varices is the most common clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H2111005451\" class=\"local\">'Splenic vein thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudoaneurysm formation is a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis. Pseudoaneurysm in a pseudocyst may be complicated by bleeding into the associated pseudocyst. Blood may remain in the pseudocyst, rupture the pseudocyst, and reach the peritoneal cavity, or reach the gut lumen through the pancreatic duct (hemosuccus pancreaticus). Patients usually present with a sudden onset of pain associated with unexplained anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pseudoaneurysms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine insufficiency ultimately occurs in 30 to 50 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis. Diabetes due to chronic pancreatitis (pancreatogenic diabetes) can lead to large fluctuations in blood sugar that are difficult to manage. (See <a href=\"#H1748071493\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hereditary pancreatitis and nonhereditary forms of chronic pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatic adenocarcinoma due to the presence of chronic pancreatic inflammation. The risk of pancreatic cancer developing in the background of chronic pancreatitis varies with the duration of disease, but also with the etiology of disease. (See <a href=\"#H1745219907\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic cancer'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hammel P, Couvelard A, O'Toole D, et al.
