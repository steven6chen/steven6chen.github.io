In practice, anemia most commonly is defined by reductions in one or both of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematocrit (HCT) &minus; The hematocrit is the fractional volume of a whole blood sample occupied by RBCs, expressed as a percentage.

In healthy term infants, hemoglobin levels are high (&gt;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> at birth and then rapidly decline, reaching a nadir of approximately 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> at six to nine weeks of age, which is called &quot;physiologic anemia of infancy&quot; (also called the &quot;physiologic nadir&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81464\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81464 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-anemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pathologic anemia in newborns and young infants is distinguished from physiologic anemia by any of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-anemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anemia (HGB &lt;13.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> within the first month of life</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anemia with lower HGB level than is typically seen with physiologic anemia (ie, &lt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs of hemolysis (eg, jaundice, scleral icterus, or dark urine) or symptoms of anemia (eg, irritability or poor feeding)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Common causes of pathologic anemia in newborns include blood loss, immune hemolytic disease (ie, Rh or ABO incompatibility), congenital infection, twin-twin transfusion, and congenital hemolytic anemia (eg, hereditary spherocytosis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101423\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101423 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn period suggests a hemolytic etiology; microcytosis at birth suggests chronic intrauterine blood loss or thalassemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compared with term infants, preterm infants are born with lower HCT and HGB, have shorter red blood cell (RBC) life span, and have impaired erythropoietin production due to immature liver function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-anemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
