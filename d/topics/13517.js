The azoles that are available for systemic use can be classified into two groups: the triazoles (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isavuconazole-isavuconazonium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isavuconazole</a>) and the imidazoles (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>).</p><p>An overview of the use of azole agents for the treatment of various systemic fungal infections will be reviewed here. Detailed disease-specific treatment recommendations are presented elsewhere.

The drugs in this class offer activity against many fungal pathogens without the serious nephrotoxic effects observed with amphotericin B. Newer azole agents have emerged as first-line therapies for several severe fungal diseases, such as invasive aspergillosis, for which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> has become the standard of care.</p><p>There are currently five members of the triazole class licensed for use in the United States (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isavuconazole-isavuconazonium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isavuconazole</a>). It is important for clinicians to appreciate the unique characteristics of each member of this class in order to use azoles appropriately.</p><p>Agents within the azole class vary importantly with regards to spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetic profiles, and toxicities. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> has excellent activity against yeasts but offers no protection against molds. An extended spectrum is provided by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, but inconsistent bioavailability limits use of this agent in severely ill patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> is the first-line agent for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, but its bioavailability is unpredictable and genetically determined, it is associated with unique side effects, and it lacks activity against the Mucorales, the agents of mucormycosis. Among the azoles, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isavuconazole-isavuconazonium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isavuconazole</a> have the broadest spectrum of activity. Both are available as intravenous and oral formulations.</p><p>The azoles have significant drug-drug interactions, but the magnitude of each interaction varies with the individual azole. Specific interactions may be determined by use of the Lexi-Interact program. A general discussion of relevant drug interactions is presented below. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> below.)</p><p>The systemic use of earlier azoles, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>, has largely been replaced by the triazoles because of superior pharmacokinetics, improved safety profiles, and higher efficacy for the treatment of systemic mycoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The azole antifungals work primarily by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This enzyme is necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, a vital component of the cellular membrane of fungi. Disruptions in the biosynthesis of ergosterol cause significant damage to the cell membrane by increasing its permeability, resulting in cell lysis and death. Despite this mechanism of action, the triazoles are generally considered fungistatic against <em>Candida</em> species. For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, fungicidal activity against <em>Aspergillus</em> species has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGIC ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each member of the azole class exhibits a unique spectrum of activity, although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isavuconazole-isavuconazonium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isavuconazole</a> all demonstrate similar activity against most <em>Candida</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Understanding the differences among the members of this class with regards to metabolism and elimination is essential in order to safely and effectively administer these agents in the complex patient populations at risk for fungal infection. It is important to appreciate the differences in bioavailability, metabolism, and toxicities among these agents, as well as among different preparations of a given drug, since inconsistencies do exist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101981 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluconazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available in both oral and intravenous (IV) preparations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> is very hydrophilic and is almost completely absorbed following oral administration; the reported bioavailability is over 90 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101981 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Fluconazole's absorption is not affected by the presence of food or gastric pH. There is also an intravenous preparation, which is useful if gastrointestinal absorption or motility is impaired.</p><p>A single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> is widely distributed into body fluids and tissues, with only 10 to 12 percent being protein bound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. High concentrations can be measured in urine as well as prostatic tissues.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> distributes well into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with levels reaching 60 to 80 percent of serum levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Fluconazole achieves concentrations in the vitreous body of 20 to 70 percent that in the serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The long serum half-life (approximately 24 hours) allows once-daily dosing. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> is metabolized to a minimal extent; greater than 80 percent of a single dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Thus, dose adjustments are necessary in patients with compromised renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Itraconazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> is widely available as a capsule and an oral solution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101981 \">table 1</a>). An intravenous formulation, available in some countries, is no longer available in the United States. </p><p>The bioavailability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> is highly variable. The capsule formulation has a bioavailability of approximately 55 percent, whereas the bioavailability of the itraconazole solution (containing cyclodextrin) in fasting state is approximately 30 percent greater than with capsules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Due to differences in bioavailability, the capsules and oral solution should not be used interchangeably, and the solution is preferred. However, gastrointestinal upset is more common with the solution, and some patients cannot tolerate this formulation.</p><p>The optimal conditions for administration of each formulation differ:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> capsules require food and an acidic gastric pH for solubilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Absorption can be increased by concurrent ingestion of cola [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] or cranberry juice, and is impaired by drugs that interfere with gastric acidification. Impaired absorption is greatest with proton pump inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], which should be avoided; intermediate with histamine H2 receptor blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/17,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,21</a>]; and least with antacids, which have a short duration of action.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, the bioavailability of the oral solution is not altered by gastric pH. It should be administered on an empty stomach for optimal absorption; even in the presence of food, higher serum concentrations are achieved with the oral solution than with the capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p>Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin is used to solubilize the intravenous and oral formulations. This vehicle is known to accumulate in patients with impaired renal function and, therefore, use of the intravenous preparation is limited to patients with a creatinine clearance &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Since the cyclodextrin vehicle is not absorbed from the oral solution, patients should be converted to either oral formulation as soon as is feasible.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> has a relatively long half-life, approaching 25 to 50 hours, and thus allows for once-daily dosing if using up to 200 mg daily. However, when 400 mg daily is required, dosing should be split into two divided doses to optimize absorption.</p><p>Approximately 99 percent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> and its active hydroxy metabolite are bound to plasma proteins. Unbound itraconazole is highly lipophilic and extensively distributed in human tissues, reaching high concentrations in the lungs, kidneys, and epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. High levels (greater than three times the corresponding serum levels) are observed in the skin, nails, liver, adipose tissue, and bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Only trace amounts are detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and the eye.</p><p>Metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> is extensive in the liver (primarily via cytochrome P450 3A4), and excretion of inactive metabolites occurs primarily in the urine and feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Active drug does not appear in the urine, and itraconazole cannot be relied upon to treat urinary tract infections. A hepatic metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole, is bioactive, with activity similar to that of the parent compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Voriconazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oral tablet formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> has a bioavailability of greater than 90 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101981 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Oral bioavailability is reduced by approximately 30 percent when taken with a high fat meal.

The powder for suspension possesses equivalent oral bioavailability compared with the tablet. The oral formulations do not contain cyclodextrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, the intravenous preparation of voriconazole contains a sulfobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin vehicle, which is known to accumulate in patients with impaired renal function. Thus, use of the intravenous preparation is limited to patients who have CrCl &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. However, it should be noted that in severe infections requiring intravenous administration, the IV formulation of voriconazole has been safely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> is well distributed throughout the body as demonstrated by its large volume of distribution (4.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span> and ability to penetrate into the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31</a>]. Voriconazole undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific enzymes involved are CYP2C19, 2C9, and 3A4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Unlike <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, there are no active metabolites. A 50 percent maintenance dose reduction, after a full loading dose, is recommended for patients with mild and moderate chronic hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Classes A and B) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p>CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms appear to play an important role in the interindividual variability that has been observed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Slow metabolizers via CYP2C19 (including 15 to 20 percent of persons of Asian descent) exhibit significantly greater systemic exposure and therefore should be considered at elevated risk of dose-related adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. CYP3A4 gene polymorphisms also appear to affect voriconazole serum concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Overview of CYP and other effects'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> is also an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4. Drug interactions should be anticipated and managed.

Thus, urine concentrations of voriconazole do not reach therapeutic levels and should <strong>not</strong> be relied upon to treat urinary tract infections. Dose adjustments of oral voriconazole are not necessary for patients with renal dysfunction.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Increasing the dose of voriconazole by 50 percent can lead to a 150 percent increase in serum concentration and a significant increase in serum half-life. This is important to consider because some voriconazole-associated toxicities are associated with higher serum concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Furthermore, higher doses of voriconazole have not been associated with improved clinical outcomes.

In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved delayed-release tablets for the prophylaxis of invasive <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Candida </em>infections in patients at high risk for these infections, such as those with hematologic malignancies with prolonged chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients with graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In 2014, the FDA approved an IV formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> for prophylaxis of invasive <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Candida </em>infections in patients aged 18 years and older at high risk for these infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The IV formulation is useful for patients when oral administration is not a viable option or in cases in which absorption may be of concern. The delayed-release tablets and oral suspension are approved for patients 13 years of age and older.</p><p>Effective absorption of the oral suspension requires oral intake, optimally with a high-fat meal, and it may be impaired in the setting of gastrointestinal tract disruption (eg, graft-versus-host disease or mucositis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101981 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. For the delayed-release tablets, administration with food is recommended; however, this formulation demonstrates less variability in pharmacokinetic parameters related to food when compared with the oral suspension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The delayed-release tablets are therefore especially useful in patients who cannot eat a full meal because, under fasting conditions, at a dose of 300 mg daily, the exposure is higher than that seen in patients taking 200 mg three times daily of the oral suspension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A study of neutropenic patients at high risk for invasive fungal infection given either 200 mg or 300 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> once daily (following a twice-daily loading dose on day 1 in both groups) without regard to food intake showed that on day 8, the pharmacokinetic exposure target was reached in 15 of 19 patients (79 percent) taking 200 mg once daily and in 31 of 32 patients (97 percent) taking 300 mg once daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Other studies have shown that patients taking the delayed-release tablets achieve higher serum concentrations than patients taking the oral suspension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

Approximately 15 percent of an administered dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> undergoes non-cytochrome 450 (CYP) hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites and is excreted in urine and feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/38,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,46</a>]. The unchanged parent drug is primarily eliminated via the fecal route (77 percent). Therefore, only minimal amounts are recovered in the urine; the drug cannot be relied upon to treat urinary tract infections, and dose reductions are not required for patients with renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Isavuconazole has a prolonged half-life (T&frac12;) of 130 hours, which enables once-daily dosing following two days of every eight hour dosing (six loading doses), and has as a large volume of distribution of about 450 L, suggesting a high degree of tissue penetration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101981 \">table 1</a>). The oral capsules are well absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 98 percent that is essentially unaltered by food intake. Isavuconazole clearance is highly dependent upon hepatic CYP3A4 metabolism and thereby subject to significant drug interactions. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> below.)</p><p>The oral and IV formulations are delivered as a water-soluble prodrug, known as isavuconazonium sulfate, which is rapidly and almost completely (&gt;99 percent) converted by plasma esterases to the active moiety <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isavuconazole-isavuconazonium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isavuconazole</a> and an inactive cleavage product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The 186 mg isavuconazonium sulfate oral capsule provides 100 mg of isavuconazole and the 372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate injection vial provides 200 mg of isavuconazole. The inactive cleavage product is rapidly eliminated by metabolism, does not appear to accumulate after repeated dosing, and represents 1.3 percent or less of the total exposure to isavuconazole. Neither IV nor oral formulations contain cyclodextrin, a solubilizing agent used in some other azoles (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>), which can accumulate in renal impairment following IV administration and potentially cause nephrotoxicity.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are most frequently reported, including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The latter is most notable with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> oral solution and is caused by the cyclodextrin vehicle, which enhances its solubility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketoconazole</a> also commonly causes GI distress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic function abnormalities are associated with all of the azoles. These range from mild elevations in transaminases to severe hepatic reactions including hepatitis, cholestasis, and fulminant hepatic failure. The approximate incidence of mild transient transaminase abnormalities associated with azole drugs is reported to be from 2 to 12 percent. Hepatic inflammation may be exposure related, especially with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, but a clear dose or time course relationship is not well established. The toxicity is usually hepatocellular but may be cholestatic or both.</p><p>Hepatic abnormalities necessitating drug discontinuation have been reported in less than 1 to 8 percent of patients in postmarketing experience and clinical trials. In most cases in which azole drug therapy was discontinued promptly following the emergence of abnormal transaminases, normalization of values and resolution of symptoms, if any, occurred gradually over weeks. Close monitoring of transaminases is recommended, particularly in the first weeks and months of therapy. The decision to stop azoles when transaminase elevations occur is made by the clinician determining the risks versus the benefits for each patient.</p><p>Careful monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended for all patients receiving azole therapy, since this adverse effect does not appear to be associated with duration of antifungal therapy or other identifiable risk factors. High-dose therapy, drug interactions, and genetic polymorphisms that increase systemic exposure to azoles may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity.

These transient effects are temporally associated with drug dosing, occurring within 30 minutes of oral or intravenous (IV) administration. Symptoms usually last for approximately 30 to 60 minutes but, in some patients, can be prolonged for hours. Clinical trials suggest that visual abnormalities may be associated with higher dosing or serum concentrations. These effects generally subside with continued therapy over several weeks.

The prescribing information suggests using total body weight with recommendations only for those patients weighing up to 100 kg, without providing guidance for subjects with higher body weight. In a study that evaluated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> concentrations among obese patients receiving weight-based dosing, those whose dosing was determined using adjusted body weight had an 80 percent likelihood of concentrations within the therapeutic range (2 to 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> compared with a 45 percent likelihood using ideal body weight and a 29 percent likelihood using total body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

One of the best characterized interactions via P-GP and azole antifungals is increased exposure of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> when given with itraconazole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chelation with divalent cations or alterations in gastric pH &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketoconazole</a> tablets, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> solution, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> capsules require gastric acidity for oral absorption.

This has led to the prescribing information for both voriconazole and posaconazole suggesting that sirolimus be avoided in patients receiving these agents. However, clinicians have sometimes coadministered these agents when clinically necessary. This practice can occur safely if the dose of sirolimus is reduced and sirolimus concentrations are monitored closely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>].

Any change in sirolimus dose needs to include a careful review of multiple factors, including sirolimus concentration at the time of azole initiation as well the individual patient's immunosuppressive requirements. Studies are ongoing regarding specific dosing algorithms based on baseline sirolimus concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-of-azoles/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].</p><p>Dose reductions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> are also necessary when used in combination with azoles. Although significant interpatient variability is seen, current recommendations are to decrease tacrolimus doses to one-third of the total daily dose when administered with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>.
