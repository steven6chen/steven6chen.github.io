The majority of these tumors (85 percent) are adenocarcinomas arising from the ductal epithelium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of exocrine pancreatic neoplasms&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Surgical resection offers the only chance of cure for exocrine pancreatic cancer, but only 15 to 20 percent of cases are potentially resectable at presentation. Local unresectability is usually (but not always) due to vascular invasion.

Given the high rates of both systemic (&gt;80 percent) and local (&gt;20 percent) recurrence after surgery alone, systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), and combined approaches (chemoradiotherapy) have been used both prior to and following surgical resection in an effort to improve cure rates. Although adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy has been shown to improve overall survival, the benefits of postoperative RT, and neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy and RT remain controversial.</p><p>Management of potentially resectable pancreatic cancer will be discussed here. Neoadjuvant strategies for locally advanced unresectable or &quot;borderline&quot; resectable exocrine pancreatic cancer, surgical management of localized exocrine pancreatic cancer, and chemotherapy for advanced disease are discussed separately.

Unfortunately, because of the late presentation of the disease, only 15 to 20 percent of patients are candidates for pancreatectomy. Most of the time, distant metastatic disease precludes potentially curative surgery. In the absence of distant metastases, local unresectability is usually (but not always) due to vascular invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97571\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97571 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>A triple-phase staging contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen or pelvis, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed for all patients to assess the anatomic relationships of the primary tumor and for the presence of intraabdominal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In general, pancreatic cancers can be categorized on a continuum from resectable to unresectable according to the involvement of adjacent structures and the presence of distant metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97572\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97572 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Tumors with limited involvement of the major peripancreatic vessels, such as the superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, superior mesenteric artery, or hepatic artery, may be technically resectable, but the impact of more aggressive resections (particularly arterial resection) on long-term outcomes is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis#H163631811\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Vascular resection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas#H176949526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the head of the pancreas&quot;, section on 'Vascular evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Some of these cases are considered &quot;borderline&quot; resectable, although the definition is variable (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H1472388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Definitions of unresectable and borderline resectable disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis#H163631811\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Vascular resection'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some reserve this term for cases where there is focal (less than one-half of the circumference) tumor abutment of the visceral arteries or short-segment occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or <span class=\"nowrap\">SMV/portal</span> vein confluence. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Others suggest that venous narrowing without occlusion should be included in the definition of borderline resectable disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encasement (more than one-half of the vein circumference) or occlusion of the SMV or the <span class=\"nowrap\">SMV/portal</span> vein confluence was previously considered unresectable.

A preferred approach is attempted downstaging with neoadjuvant therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91436\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91436 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H606636900\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial chemotherapy and radiation for nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable and borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Borderline resectable disease'</a>.) </p><p>Absolute contraindications to resection include the presence of metastases in the liver, peritoneum, omentum, or any extraabdominal site.

Management of these patients usually entails initial chemotherapy and not surgical exploration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91436\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91436 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Elevated levels of CA 19-9 can help to predict the presence of radiographically occult metastatic disease, the likelihood of a complete (R0) resection, and long-term outcomes in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, while high levels of CA 19-9 may help surgeons to better select patients who need staging laparoscopy, an expert panel convened by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommended against the use of CA 19-9 alone as an indicator of operability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Furthermore, while a year 2016 Clinical Practice Guideline on management of potentially curable pancreatic cancer from ASCO suggested that chemotherapy could be used before surgery for patients who had potentially anatomically resectable but high-risk tumors (as judged by elevated preoperative levels of CA 19-9), there was no recommendation for a specific cutoff value of CA 19-9 to select patients for neoadjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In our view, serum CA 19-9 levels should not be used to direct the initial treatment strategy. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Primary surgical resection should only be offered to patients who have a performance status and comorbidity profile that are appropriate for a major abdominal operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. All patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer should have a full assessment of symptom burden, psychological status, and social supports as early as possible. In sone instances, this may indicate the need for a formal palliative care consult.

Surgery could then be reconsidered at a later time, if appropriate.

This recommendation is consistent with guidelines from ASCO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>], the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (<a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootl5u5ItFaoGPJJunOP2mjbo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2477\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>), and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6493811\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing and duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal timing and duration of adjuvant therapy is not established. A focused guideline update on potentially curable pancreatic cancer from ASCO recommends adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for six months starting within eight weeks of surgery, assuming adequate recovery from surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There are no randomized trials addressing the impact of delayed initiation of adjuvant therapy on outcomes or the effect of a longer duration of therapy. However, at least some data support the view that delaying treatment initiation to allow full recovery from surgery does not compromise the survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], and modern adjuvant chemotherapy trials have permitted enrollment up to 12 weeks postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Persistent postoperative elevations of the serum tumor marker CA 19-9 are associated with poor long-term prognosis. However, CA 19-9 levels are prognostic and not predictive of benefit from adjuvant therapy.</p><p>While some suggest withholding adjuvant therapy from such patients or treating them as if they have advanced metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and some adjuvant therapy protocols, such as Radiation Therapy Oncology Group <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=RTOG+0848&Search=Search&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPMBFp4LbdRF9wqEcK72QjmNTRe2Bg5WYJPhHQOFWpvhPpc92n+YVuywHSOq4qeWZrY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2477\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(RTOG) 0848</a>, only allow enrollment if the posttreatment CA 19-9 level is &le;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> we (and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]) suggest not using postoperative CA 19-9 levels to determine whether or not to give postoperative adjuvant therapy outside of the context of a clinical trial.

However, therapy with gemcitabine alone or, where available, S-1 alone is a reasonable option, particularly for patients with a borderline performance status or a comorbidity profile that precludes intensive therapy.

The most recent (2012) guidelines for treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma from ESMO suggest that chemoradiotherapy in the adjuvant setting should only be undertaken within the context of a randomized controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The conditional probability of receiving neoadjuvant therapy (the propensity score) was estimated based upon age, gender, race, ethnicity, year of diagnosis, income, insurance type, area of residence, comorbidity, facility type, clinical stage, and type of surgery. From the group receiving neoadjuvant therapy (47 percent multiagent, 43 percent single agent, 10 percent unspecified), 2005 patients were propensity score matched to 6015 patients who had upfront resection. Patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy had a lower likelihood of positive lymph nodes (48 versus 73 percent) and lower rates of pathologic <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/T4</span> stage disease (73 versus 86 percent). The group receiving neoadjuvant therapy had a significantly better median survival (median 26 versus 21 months), and rates of three- and five-year survival were also modestly higher (35 and 21 versus 29 and 18 percent, respectively, in the upfront surgery group). This difference was smaller when patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy were compared with the subset of patients undergoing upfront surgery who also received adjuvant therapy (67 percent of the total, median 26 versus 23 months; three- and five-year survival rates 35 and 21 versus 31 and 18 percent, respectively). In addition to the inherent limitations of retrospective analyses of data from large databases, another major limitation of these data is that patients in the neoadjuvant therapy group represented only those who tolerated neoadjuvant therapy and underwent resection; the number of patients who embarked upon neoadjuvant therapy for management of what was presumed to be resectable disease but never proceeded to surgery could not be determined. However, the authors postulated that, in addition to its potential for downstaging to enhance resectability, another benefit of neoadjuvant therapy is the avoidance of a Whipple procedure in patients who manifest rapid progression of disease while receiving preoperative therapy, for whom surgical intervention would not be beneficial.</p><p>A similar improvement in overall survival was seen with neoadjuvant as compared to adjuvant therapy in a separate retrospective analysis of 593 patients with clinical stage III pancreatic cancer, also derived from the NCDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>In our view, these data underscore the need for a randomized trial comparing modern neoadjuvant therapy (which increasingly includes multiagent chemotherapy regimens) with upfront resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer.

If carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) levels were initially elevated, we follow them every three to six months for at least two years and, if elevated, perform a CT scan. An important point is that mild elevations in CA 19-9 can occur with biliary tract dysfunction, which often occurs in patients after a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Thus, noncancerous causes can lead to abnormal results in these patients.</p><p>Given that there is no known curative treatment for patients with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma, we do not routinely obtain CT scans in the follow-up of patients following resection of a pancreatic cancer. Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer inevitably develop symptoms and will present for treatment discussions. Additionally, it is not clear that early initiation of therapy in asymptomatic individuals is associated with a survival benefit, thereby calling into question any surveillance technique. As a result, many clinicians, including some of the authors of this topic review, do not routinely obtain CT scans in the follow-up of patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy unless indicated by symptoms or a rising CA 19-9 level.

Unfortunately, only 15 to 20 percent of patients are candidates for pancreatectomy, mostly because of distant metastatic disease. Local unresectability is usually (but not always) due to vascular invasion. A multiphase computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen or pelvis, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed for all patients to assess the anatomic relationships of the primary tumor and for the presence of intraabdominal metastases. (See <a href=\"#H2392375159\" class=\"local\">'Assessing resectability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baseline performance status, comorbidity profile, symptom burden, and goals of care should be evaluated and established. Distressing symptoms and concerns that may require ongoing supportive care include pain, anorexia and weight loss, depression and anxiety, biliary obstruction, pancreatic insufficiency, and venous thromboembolism. These should be managed aggressively, and early referral to palliative care should be initiated for those with a high symptom burden. (See <a href=\"#H2346588280\" class=\"local\">'Suitability for resection and symptom burden'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Primary surgical resection is only recommended for patients who have no metastases, appropriate performance status and comorbidity profiles, and no radiographic interface between the primary tumor and the mesenteric vasculature. For those patients who have potentially resectable tumors, and a performance status or comorbidity profile that is not appropriate for a major abdominal operation but is potentially reversible, we suggest initial chemotherapy, as is used for borderline resectable pancreatic cancers. Surgery could then be reconsidered at a later time, if appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H606636900\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial chemotherapy and radiation for nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable and borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Borderline resectable disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for all patients with resected pancreatic cancer, including those with resected T1N0 disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111135 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).

We agree with guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) that recommend adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for six months starting within eight weeks of surgery, assuming adequate recovery from surgery. Prior to beginning adjuvant therapy, all patients should undergo formal restaging with CT scans and a serum level of the tumor marker carbohydrate 19-9 (CA 19-9; also called cancer antigen 19-9). (See <a href=\"#H6493811\" class=\"local\">'Timing and duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus regarding the optimal adjuvant therapy strategy, and the approach differs in United States and elsewhere (see <a href=\"#H86726713\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most clinicians outside of the United States use chemotherapy alone after resection of a pancreatic neoplasm.

Eligible patients should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials evaluating the potential benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemoradiotherapy, as well as new therapies including neoadjuvant therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If protocol therapy is not available or declined, we suggest six months of combination chemotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> rather than gemcitabine monotherapy for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, therapy with gemcitabine alone is a reasonable option, particularly for patients with a borderline performance status or a comorbidity profile that precludes intensive therapy. For Japanese patients, S-1, where available, represents a preferred alternative to gemcitabine because of its oral bioavailability and better tolerability. There is not enough evidence to know whether S-1 is as beneficial in non-Japanese patients. (See <a href=\"#H2004855430\" class=\"local\">'Gemcitabine plus capecitabine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H982986887\" class=\"local\">'Gemcitabine versus a fluoropyrimidine'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Full weight-based cytotoxic chemotherapy doses should be used to treat obese patients, particularly given that the goal of treatment is cure.

During the concurrent chemoradiotherapy portion, we prefer infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) over either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> or bolus FU (see <a href=\"#H29198019\" class=\"local\">'FU-based approaches'</a> above). The substitution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> (or where available, S-1) for infusional FU during the chemoradiotherapy portion is reasonable in patients for whom ambulatory infusional FU therapy using a pump is not feasible. (See <a href=\"#H1047270796\" class=\"local\">'Oral fluoropyrimidines as a substitute for infusional FU'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal way to sequence FU-based chemoradiotherapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> chemotherapy is not established.
