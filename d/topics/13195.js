In the United States, breast cancer is second to lung cancer as the most common cause of cancer death in women, and the main cause of death in women ages 40 to 49 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, there has been a decline in breast cancer mortality rates in the United States and elsewhere in the Western world, attributable to the increased use of screening mammography and advances in adjuvant therapies. As a result of improved survival and the aging of the population, there are over three million women living with a history of breast cancer in the United States alone, accounting for 41 percent of all female cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Breast cancer survivors are the largest constituent of all cancer survivors, representing 3.6 percent of the United States population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The majority of breast cancer recurrences occur within the first five years of diagnosis, particularly with hormone receptor-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease. However, some recurrences occur much later, particularly in the setting of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative tumors, which tend to behave more indolently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This was shown in a study of 2838 patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> or III breast cancer who had not recurred within five years of completing initial therapy; recurrence risks in the subsequent 5 and 10 years were still 11 and 19 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Relapse patterns and long-term complications of therapy for invasive breast cancer in women who are at least five years out from their initial diagnosis will be reviewed here. Recommendations for surveillance strategies in breast cancer survivors and an overview of the approach to breast cancer survivors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1203495\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF BREAST CANCER</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201175\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with early-stage and locally advanced breast cancer require a multidisciplinary treatment approach that may include surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and systemic therapy. The following provides a broad overview of contemporary breast cancer treatment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cancer in men&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201190\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with newly diagnosed breast cancer, the surgical approach depends on extent of disease and patient preference, with consideration given if the patient has a known genetic mutation. In general, women with limited breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) undergo breast-conserving surgery. Axillary node evaluation is not routinely indicated for these women as long as an invasive component is not present in the excised breast tissue. However, for more extensive disease (ie, tumor extent &gt;3 cm) or if there was evidence of microinvasive disease, a sentinel node biopsy is generally performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ductal carcinoma in situ: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most women with early invasive breast cancer require surgery to remove the primary breast tumor and evaluate ipsilateral axillary nodes. However, some women with early-stage disease and most women with locally advanced disease do not undergo initial surgery. Instead, these women are often treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy prior to definitive surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Patient selection for BCT'</a> and <a href=\"#H35822834\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management#H374254753\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastectomy: Indications, types, and concurrent axillary lymph node management&quot;, section on 'Selection criteria for mastectomy'</a>.)<br/></p><p>The removal of lymph nodes for women with invasive breast cancer gives important staging information and is used to make further treatment decisions. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is less morbid than axillary lymph node dissection and results in similar survival outcomes. Therefore, women with early-stage breast cancer without evidence of clinical axillary node involvement typically undergo a sentinel node procedure. Patients who are found to have three or more positive nodes typically undergo a completion axillary dissection. Women who are recommended for neoadjuvant chemotherapy will often undergo a work-up to evaluate nodal status prior to the initiation of chemotherapy. This is discussed more extensively separately, as is axillary radiotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer#H11994803\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Node evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>For women who present with metastatic disease (outside the breast and axilla), systemic therapy is usually administered. However, surgery may play a role in symptom management. In these cases, decisions regarding surgery are based on individual consideration of symptoms and disease characteristics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of local therapies in metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-breast-cancer-in-women-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women: Chemotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201197\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast RT is an important component of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for both in situ and invasive breast cancer. RT may also be administered to some women following a mastectomy, particularly those with large tumors (ie, &gt;5 cm), positive margins, and nodal involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35822819\"><span class=\"h3\">Endocrine therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocrine therapy is appropriate treatment for patients with estrogen (ER) or progesterone (PR) receptor-positive tumors. In most patients, treatment options in the adjuvant setting are made using the same general principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with DCIS, five years of endocrine treatment following breast surgery is often considered to reduce the risk of in-breast tumor recurrence and contralateral breast events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis#H434848994\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ductal carcinoma in situ: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Tamoxifen'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For premenopausal women, there are several options available, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> or ovarian suppression or ablation with an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen. For patients determined to be at high risk for recurrence, the option of ovarian suppression plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exemestane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exemestane</a> is also reasonable. However, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) without ovarian suppression are generally avoided because of the lack of evidence that AIs adequately suppress estrogen in premenopausal women, and the potential that AIs will increase gonadotropin release and result in stimulation of ovarian function.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chemotherapy is also administered prior to surgery (ie, neoadjuvant therapy) for women who present with locally advanced breast cancer and in those women who are not candidates for breast-conserving surgery at the time of presentation, although women with smaller tumors at the time of presentation may have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy as well. Finally, neoadjuvant systemic therapy is also increasingly used in clinical trials, since tumor tissue is available at diagnosis and again after medical therapy at the time of definitive surgery. This affords clinico-biologic correlations that are essential in understanding cancer response and resistance. The clinical objective of treatment is to induce a tumor response to improve the chances for breast-conserving surgery. However, there is no evidence that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves survival outcomes (compared with surgery followed by adjuvant treatment).

For women treated for early breast cancer, the recurrence rate ranges from 4 to 7 percent with mastectomy or BCT, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>For women treated with BCT, locoregional recurrences tend to occur later compared with those who underwent a mastectomy. In either case, potentially curative surgery may be an option. The surgical approach depends on whether or not RT (and the type of RT) was previously administered. In general, for women who were previously treated with BCT and experience a locoregional recurrence, a mastectomy should be performed because reirradiation is not generally an option to reduce the risk of another local recurrence. However, for women who did not previously receive RT and for those treated with partial breast irradiation, reexcision may be appropriate because they may be candidates for RT.</p><p>By contrast, a local recurrence following mastectomy is usually manifest as a mass in the chest wall, regional nodal basins (ie, infraclavicular, supraclavicular, and axillary regions), or overlying skin. Treatment generally involves excision of the recurrence (if surgically resectable) and RT (if not previously administered). Following excision, data support the use of postoperative chemotherapy in an effort to improve survival outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, if relapse occurs within two years of primary treatment, distant metastatic disease is already present in 25 to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and for these patients systemic therapy is generally administered.

The most common sites of metastases are bone, liver, and lung. Approximately 50 to 75 percent of patients who relapse distantly do so in a single organ; the remainder will develop diffuse metastatic disease. Less than 5 percent of patients will manifest central nervous system (CNS) involvement as the first site of metastatic disease.

As an example, in data from an Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group meta-analysis, the annual odds ratio for contralateral breast cancer for irradiated compared with nonirradiated women was 1.18 (p = 0.002) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This result was statistically significant for women 50 years of age and older (1.25, p = 0.002) but not for younger women (1.09, p = 0.30). On the other hand, other data suggest that the risk may be higher with younger age at treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. A Dutch report suggests that postmastectomy radiotherapy using direct electron fields leads to a significantly lower radiation exposure to the contralateral breast than postlumpectomy RT using photons with tangential fields [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The joint effects of postlumpectomy RT and strong family history for breast cancer in this series were associated with a higher risk for a secondary breast tumor than expected when individual risks were summed (hazard ratio 3.52). However, a nested case-control study by the investigators from the Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study Collaborative group, which included patients with known <em>BRCA1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>BRCA2</span> </em>mutations, did not find a significant increase in contralateral breast cancers in carriers irradiated for breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A similar finding was reported in a separate study of breast cancer patients who were carriers of deleterious <em>BRCA</em> mutations despite the use of tangential fields in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, for women with a known <em>BRCA</em> mutation, an MRI is often a part of the surveillance following treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>Data are sparse to inform optimal follow-up of male breast cancer survivors; recommendations for women are usually applied to men, with modification as appropriate.</p><p>A more extensive discussion on the follow-up of long-term breast cancer survivors is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32247236\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in females worldwide. In the United States, breast cancer is the most common female cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death in women, and the main cause of death in women ages 40 to 49 years. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have undergone either mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy (BCT) are at risk for locoregional recurrence. Women who undergo BCT without radiation therapy (RT) have a much higher rate of local recurrence compared with those who receive RT. For patients who have received RT after breast-conserving surgery, local recurrences tend to occur later than after mastectomy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Locoregional recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common sites of metastases are bone, liver, and lung. Approximately 50 to 75 percent of patients who relapse distantly do so in a single organ; the remainder will go on to develop diffuse metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H1199208\" class=\"local\">'Second primary breast tumors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast surgery, breast reconstruction, and RT may result in long-term complications in the breast and chest wall. These include formation of seromas, recurrent skin infections, and rarely, soft tissue necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H1201318\" class=\"local\">'Chest wall and breast complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal complications can also be attributed to several modalities used to treat breast cancer. This includes reduced arm mobility and lymphedema secondary to surgery; pain, motor restriction, and a higher risk of fractures secondary to RT; and muscle and joint pains due to aromatase inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H1201327\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both breast surgery and radiation can lead to the development of lymphedema of the breast, chest, arm, and hand. Rates of lymphedema are highest in women who undergo mastectomy with full axillary lymph dissection plus chest wall and axillary RT. (See <a href=\"#H1202250\" class=\"local\">'Lymphedema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast surgery, RT, and chemotherapy can be associated with nerve injury, which can cause long-term symptoms of paresthesias, weakness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent pain. (See <a href=\"#H1201336\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular disease may be a complication of breast RT if a portion of the heart is in-field and specific agents are used in the treatment of breast cancer, especially anthracyclines and the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-directed agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>, especially in combination with left-sided breast irradiation. Symptoms of early congestive heart failure should prompt a cardiac evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular morbidity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increased risk for second cancers associated with breast cancer treatment, whether breast irradiation, chemotherapy, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Second cancers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extent of disability associated with treatment-related cognitive dysfunction appears to be small. Cognitive ability stabilizes approximately six months following completion of treatment, though patients may be at risk for minor issues related to verbal and visuospatial abilities. (See <a href=\"#H556219388\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women may experience heightened anxiety after the completion of therapy, particularly worry about the risk of recurrence. Fear of recurrence can persist for years. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Psychological effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue may persist in survivors for years after cessation of treatment. Before assuming that fatigue is related to prior treatment for breast cancer, treatable reasons for low energy should be ruled out, including anemia, thyroid dysfunction, pain, depression, and lack of sleep. (See <a href=\"#H711068098\" class=\"local\">'Fatigue'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast cancer survivors should receive ongoing age-appropriate screening and preventive care, consistent with recommendations for the general population, for conditions other than those related to breast cancer and its treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a history of breast cancer should undergo regular follow-up including medical history, physical examination, surveillance mammography, and evaluation and management of treatment-related late effects, including assessment of psychosocial distress. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for surveillance should not be performed as part of routine surveillance.
