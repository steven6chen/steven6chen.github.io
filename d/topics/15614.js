This is due in part to the absence of renal excretion and to the frequent presence of multiple comorbid conditions. Since the diagnosis of many diseases is based upon the detection of elevated levels of these enzymes, the accurate clinical assessment of the patient with ESRD is hampered by a paucity of knowledge concerning the serum concentrations of different enzymes in various disease states.</p><p>The use and significance of variations in the concentrations of serum enzymes in dialysis patients will be reviewed here. A discussion of serum cardiac enzymes in patients with renal failure is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-cardiac-biomarkers-in-patients-with-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum cardiac biomarkers in patients with renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER ENZYMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum enzymes most commonly used to help assess the diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease include the aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Aminotransferases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum concentrations of aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST [SGOT] and ALT [SGPT]) are routinely measured to assess liver function in patients with and without renal failure. The aminotransferases are normally present in the circulation in low concentrations, usually &lt;40 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H151730394\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Liver enzymes'</a>.)</p><p>The concentrations of serum aminotransferases in both chronic dialysis and chronic kidney disease patients most commonly fall within the lower end of the range of normal values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Although the exact cause is unknown, possible underlying reasons may be related to pyridoxine deficiency (pyridoxal phosphate is a necessary coenzyme for ALT and AST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of an inhibitory substance in the uremic milieu [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In one study, for example, an increase in serum AST was observed after hemodialysis, suggesting the removal of an inhibitory substance with dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This effect was not due to urea alone, since the addition of urea to normal serum was not associated with a decline in the activity of AST. In this observational report, serum AST also positively correlated with the level of renal function in a transplant recipient, declining in association with rejection or the need to resume hemodialysis.</p><p>The use of standard reference values for aminotransferases to help detect liver disease is therefore less useful in patients undergoing chronic dialysis therapy. In one study of over 500 dialysis patients, standard cutoff values for aminotransferases were found to be poor indicators of active liver disease among hepatitis C antibody-positive individuals who were undergoing liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>As a result, some investigators have suggested that, to increase the sensitivity of liver function tests among dialysis patients, lower &quot;normal&quot; values of aminotransferases should be adopted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In one study, the conventional upper limit of normal of 40 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> for AST and ALT was changed to 24 and 17 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L,</span> respectively. To detect liver disease resulting from hepatitis B, these altered values enhanced the sensitivity in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis from approximately 27 to 72 percent for AST and from 18 to 64 percent for ALT. We therefore recommend using levels of 24 and 17 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> for AST and ALT, respectively, as the upper limits of normal in dialysis patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gammaglutamyl transpeptidase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum concentration of GGT is usually normal in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the absence of liver disease. However, approximately 10 percent of patients with ESRD have unexplained elevations in serum GGT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Alkaline phosphatase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma alkaline phosphatase activity can originate from liver, bone, intestine, or placenta; in most patients and normals, the majority of circulating activity consists of isoenzymes derived from either liver or bone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enzymatic measures of cholestasis (eg, alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase are elevated in many dialysis patients because of concurrent renal osteodystrophy. The most reliable method of determining the tissue origin of the enzyme is polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a test that is not routinely performed in most clinical laboratories. Since bone-derived alkaline phosphatase is heat labile but liver derived is not, the source of elevated levels of this enzyme may be partially uncovered by the exposure of serum to elevated temperatures.</p><p>As a result, elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase alone in dialysis patients only minimally suggest possible obstructive biliary disease. The possibility of hepatobiliary disease should be more seriously entertained if persistent elevations of this enzyme are found in conjunction with increased serum GGT or 5'-nucleotidase and if hyperparathyroidism has been excluded. Retrospective studies have suggested a link between increased alkaline phosphatase and increased mortality in both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis populations. Possible mechanisms for this include poor bone health, increased vascular calcification, and higher levels of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREATIC ENZYMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marked elevations of amylase and lipase are frequently used to help diagnose pancreatitis in patients without renal failure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>). However, serum concentrations of pancreatic amylase and lipase are elevated in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the absence of acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/13-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-23</a>]. The highest levels of amylase and lipase are noted in hemodialysis patients, but marked elevations can also be seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those undergoing peritoneal dialysis. A threefold to fivefold increase in amylase and lipase levels is most commonly observed, but the absolute values do not exceed <strong>three times</strong> the upper limit of normal. The degree of elevation is roughly proportional to the degree of renal dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unique-aspects-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unique aspects of gastrointestinal disease in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Amylase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevations in serum amylase among patients with renal failure or ESRD are most likely due to impaired renal clearance. In one study, the serum amylase began to rise only when the creatinine clearance dropped below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The dialysis procedure alone does not appear to alter serum amylase. In one study, for example, no change was observed in serum amylase in samples obtained pre- and postdialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, these observations are confounded by the failure to correlate levels of amylase with variations in dialysis membrane clearance. In this study, one patient with acute pancreatitis had an increase in the P3 isoamylase band, a finding not observed in those without acute pancreatitis.</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a> as an osmotic agent for peritoneal dialysis may decrease measured serum amylase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Based upon competition for enzymatic cleavage, icodextrin reduced measured amylase activity by 90 percent in one study of peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Lipase activity, however, was not affected. The serum amylase should not be used for the diagnosis of pancreatitis among patients utilizing icodextrin in their peritoneal dialysis regimen. Icodextrin and its metabolites are essentially completely cleared from the circulation by one week after discontinuation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with amylase, the elevations in serum lipase observed in patients with ESRD are most likely due to renal dysfunction. However, unlike amylase, the levels of lipase are also increased by the dialysis procedure itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The cause of increased serum lipase in postdialysis samples may be related to the use of heparin during dialysis. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that the postdialysis rise in serum lipase can be prevented by replacing heparin with alternate anticoagulants, nafamostat mesylate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=defibrotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">defibrotide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The apparent heparin-induced postdialysis elevation in serum lipase may be attributable to the following properties of heparin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipolytic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crossreactivity with lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to induce endothelial lipoprotein lipase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Trypsinogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased serum concentrations of trypsinogen have been observed in asymptomatic dialysis and chronic kidney disease patients; it is therefore of diminished utility in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Conclusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chronic threefold to fivefold increase in serum amylase and lipase concentrations among dialysis and chronic kidney disease patients interferes with the serologic diagnosis of suspected pancreatitis. In addition, since hemodialysis elevates lipase levels, postdialysis increases in serum lipase must be interpreted with caution. Thus, whenever possible, the serum concentration of lipase should be evaluated when the patient is not exposed to heparin.</p><p>Among dialysis patients suspected of pancreatitis, a rise in serum amylase <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lipase levels that is temporally associated with the onset of abdominal pain or is more than <strong>three times</strong> the upper limit of normal may be helpful. In addition, determination of the P3 isoamylase band may help distinguish elevations of amylase resulting from true pancreatitis from those caused by renal failure alone. Furthermore, based upon limited evidence, the measurement of lipase may be preferred to amylase for the diagnosis of pancreatitis among peritoneal dialysis patients using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-enzymes-in-patients-with-renal-failure/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].
