Postoperatively, detectable serum PSA using standard immunoassays is indicative of residual prostatic tissue, which presumably represents locoregional or systemic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Whether such disease is locally confined to the pelvis or represents systemic metastases is an important distinction with significant implications for patient management.

In contrast, if the PSA gradually rises after remaining undetectable for two or more years, an isolated local recurrence in the prostatic bed is more likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

According to AUA guidelines, a biochemical recurrence is defined as a serum PSA &ge;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> which is confirmed by a second determination with a PSA &ge;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2951723781\"><span class=\"h3\">Benign PSA rise after radical prostatectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncommonly (5 to 15 percent of patients), patients can develop a slowly rising PSA that does not represent prostate cancer recurrence. This is due to a small amount of residual noncancerous prostate tissue remaining in situ after surgery and slowly growing to produce a small quantity of PSA that becomes detectable in the blood. However, a PSA level of 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> after successful radical prostatectomy is highly concerning for recurrent disease; patients with a persistent or rising PSA at this level should be considered for adjunctive therapy, generally radiation therapy to the prostatic bed.

While we do not want to delay potentially curative prostate bed radiation therapy (RT) for PSA recurrence, it may be better to follow the PSA in these equivocal cases to be more sure of a true cancer recurrence before initiation of salvage therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">After radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of biochemical failure is complicated after RT, whether given by external beam techniques, brachytherapy, or a combination. Some normal prostatic glandular tissue remains and serum PSA levels are unlikely to fall to undetectable levels following a course of RT. The interpretation of serum PSA levels is also complicated in some patients with intermediate or high risk disease by the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which can suppress serum PSA.</p><p>Meeting criteria for biochemical relapse based upon fulfilling criteria for a biochemical failure does not necessarily mandate treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81452718\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of RT on PSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decline in serum PSA following RT is gradual and the mean time for the PSA to reach its nadir is 18 months or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The rate of decline in the serum PSA does not appear to correlate with the risk of subsequent disease relapse. PSA is usually measured every three to six months following RT.</p><p>The nadir of the serum PSA concentration (ie, the lowest level to which it drops) is a strong indicator of treatment success following RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Although lower nadir values are associated with improved outcomes, no absolute level can distinguish treatment success from treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A consensus panel convened by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in 1996 recommended that the nadir PSA value be considered a prognostic factor similar to pretreatment variables such as serum PSA, Gleason score, and clinical tumor (T) stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Men who normalize their serum PSA after receiving a full course of RT seem to have more durable responses than those who do not. Relative stability of the PSA nadir is important, since a rising serum PSA probably indicates recurrence. </p><p>Models have been developed to predict the future risk of a clinical relapse after RT in individual patients, based upon pretreatment variables, the RT dose, and the results of posttreatment serum PSA levels, but they are not yet available for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Phoenix criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second consensus conference was held by ASTRO in 2005 to address issues that had been identified in the application of the 1996 definition of PSA failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

This PSA bounce can occur in the absence of recurrent disease and does not necessarily signify a treatment failure or constitute an indication for therapeutic intervention. There are no definitive methods to distinguish a PSA bounce from recurrent cancer.</p><p>If an increase in serum PSA is observed, the patient should be given reassurance, and the PSA can be repeated in three to six months. If serum PSA continues to increase, a repeat biopsy can be considered, although the interpretation of a prostate biopsy performed following RT is difficult.

The frequency with which such PSA bounces are observed varies, depending upon the definition used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. </p><p>The most extensive data on the PSA bounce phenomenon come from a consecutive series of 820 patients treated with low-dose rate brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Regardless of the definition used, PSA bounces occurred significantly earlier compared with biochemical failure, as defined by a PSA rise &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> above nadir (15 to 17 versus 34 months). </p><p>The clinical implications of a PSA bounce are uncertain.

In multivariate models, the most important determinants of outcome are the pretreatment serum PSA and Gleason score, as well as the anatomic extent of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-staging-and-evaluation-of-men-with-newly-diagnosed-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial staging and evaluation of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most PSA recurrences are diagnosed early, but the time to PSA recurrence can be variable. In a series of 4561 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy, 31 percent eventually developed a PSA recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Of these, approximately 90 percent occurred within the first five years. Patients with a pretreatment PSA &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and those with a Gleason score &lt;7 were more likely to have a delayed recurrence.</p><p>Several models or nomograms to predict outcome following a PSA recurrence are available. Some are based only upon pretreatment factors, while others incorporate the pathologic examination of the surgical specimen and, in one case, the duration of time that a man has remained free of progression since surgery.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'After radical prostatectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients initially treated with external beam radiation therapy, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) has developed the Phoenix criteria, which define PSA recurrence as a PSA rise of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or more above the nadir PSA, regardless of whether or not a patient receives androgen deprivation therapy. The date of failure is defined by the time the rise in PSA is noted. Although the Phoenix criteria were initially developed for external beam radiation therapy only, the same definition is used for patients treated with brachytherapy.
