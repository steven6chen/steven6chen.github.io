As an example, a single-center study identified seizures in 3 of 120 patients (2.5 percent) with a serum sodium of 115 to 119 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> 3 of 54 patients (5.4 percent) with a serum sodium of 110 to 114 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> and 4 of 39 patients (10 percent) with a serum sodium of less than 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, another study reported that seizures occurred in only 7 percent of patients with chronic hyponatremia and a serum sodium of 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or less; by contrast, the incidence of seizures was 30 percent in patients with acute hyponatremia of this severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

They occur most commonly in patients with chronic hyponatremia (present for more than 48 hours) that is severe (serum sodium concentration less than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and, in such cases, result from brain adaptations that minimize cerebral edema but alter the composition of brain cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In patients with severe, chronic hyponatremia, these findings are usually <strong>not</strong> associated with impending herniation.

However, &quot;asymptomatic&quot; patients, particularly those with chronic hyponatremia of moderate severity (120 to 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> may have subtle impairments in mentation and gait and an increased risk of falls and fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Thus, such patients are often offered chronic therapies to normalize the serum sodium concentration in an effort to treat these subtle manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and to avoid the possibility that the serum sodium concentration will fall further and produce more serious symptoms. Chronic therapies that are used include oral urea, salt tablets and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, or vasopressin antagonists.

(See <a href=\"#H4009606411\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy (first six hours)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2256462997\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent therapy (first several days)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3846419659\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevent a further decline in serum sodium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of a further fall in the serum sodium concentration is especially high for the following groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute hyponatremia due to self-induced water intoxication (for example, competitive runners, psychotic patients with extreme polydipsia, and users of ecstasy). In such patients, delayed absorption of ingested water from the gastrointestinal tract may produce a further decline in the serum sodium concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute hyponatremia caused by parenteral fluid administration, as in patients with postoperative hyponatremia due to surgery-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Large volumes of isotonic fluid produce volume expansion and result in increased sodium excretion in the urine. If ADH levels are high, the excretion of this sodium in a concentrated urine will cause the serum sodium to fall further, a phenomenon that has been called &quot;desalination&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, administration of additional isotonic saline should be avoided in such patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347836271\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevent brain herniation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatal herniation is the most dreaded complication of hyponatremia. Herniation has been reported almost exclusively in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute hyponatremia due to massive water ingestion associated with psychosis, competitive exercise, or use of the recreational drug ecstasy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women and children with acute postoperative hyponatremia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremic patients with intracranial pathology such as recent traumatic brain injury, recent intracranial surgery or hemorrhage, or an intracranial neoplasm or other space-occupying lesion</p><p/><p>In such patients, when the serum sodium concentration falls to less than 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> even mild, nonspecific symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion) may rapidly progress to seizures, respiratory arrest, and permanent or fatal brain damage.</p><p>Concurrent hypoxemia, which may result from noncardiogenic pulmonary edema or hypoventilation, can exacerbate hyponatremia-induced cerebral edema and lead to a vicious cycle ending in death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Impending herniation can be successfully reversed with a 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> increase in the serum sodium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the clinical settings listed above, other patients with hyponatremia have virtually no risk of herniation. Although such patients who are hospitalized with hyponatremia have a high mortality rate, deaths associated with hyponatremia are primarily due to the underlying disease and are rarely caused by cerebral edema. In one study, for example, only 1 of 664 patients with a serum sodium less than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> admitted to a community hospital over the course of 12 years died from cerebral edema, and this patient had coexistent intracranial pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2345501648\"><span class=\"h2\">Relieve symptoms of hyponatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to determine whether or not hyponatremia may be producing symptoms and to relieve those symptoms by raising the serum sodium concentration. Symptoms of hyponatremia are nonspecific, but if the serum sodium is less than 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> we assume that hyponatremia may be responsible. (See <a href=\"#H1976719484\" class=\"local\">'Determine the severity of symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p>The urgency and, therefore, treatment to raise the serum sodium varies depending upon the severity of symptoms, the acuity of hyponatremia, the level of the serum sodium concentration, and the patient's underlying condition. Even the most extreme symptoms can be relieved by a 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> increase in serum sodium during the first 24 hours. Thus, if symptoms persist after an increase of this magnitude, there is no benefit and, in some cases, potential harm from correcting at a faster rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2950100576\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid overcorrection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overly rapid correction of severe, chronic hyponatremia (ie, chronic hyponatremia with a serum sodium concentration below 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and particularly below 115 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> can lead to a severe and sometimes irreversible neurologic disorder called the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/2,4,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,13-16</a>].</p><p>Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia can result from efforts to raise the serum sodium, such as administration of hypertonic saline or vasopressin antagonists, or from elimination of the underlying cause of hyponatremia, such as the administration of saline to patients with true volume depletion or glucocorticoid therapy in adrenal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H1349064078\" class=\"local\">'Diagnose and treat the underlying cause of hyponatremia'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients are at particularly high or low risk for ODS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for ODS'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk for ODS &ndash; Patients at highest risk for ODS are those with serum sodium concentrations of less than or equal to 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and those with hypokalemia, alcoholism, malnutrition, and liver disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low risk for ODS &ndash; One group that is probably not at risk for this complication is patients with acute hyponatremia that developed over a few hours due to a marked increase in water intake, as can occur in marathon runners, patients with primary polydipsia, and users of ecstasy. These patients have not had time for the brain adaptations that reduce the severity of brain swelling but also increase the risk of harm from rapid correction of the hyponatremia. In addition, the risk of hyponatremia is low when the serum sodium concentration is greater than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L;</span> therefore, there should be little hesitation to treat acute hyponatremia with hypertonic saline even when symptoms are mild and the serum sodium concentration is only slightly below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.

In the first six hours after hyponatremia is recognized, therapy is directed at achieving the first three of the therapeutic goals noted above: assuring that the serum sodium concentration does not continue to decline, preventing or treating impending herniation (in certain clinical settings), and relieving hyponatremic symptoms.

Since most of the additional potassium enters the cells, electroneutrality is maintained in one of three ways, each of which will raise the serum sodium concentration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracellular sodium moves into the extracellular fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracellular chloride moves into the cells with potassium; the increase in cell osmolality promotes free water entry into the cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracellular hydrogen moves into the extracellular fluid. These hydrogen ions are buffered by extracellular bicarbonate and, to a much lesser degree, plasma proteins. This buffering converts the bicarbonate ions to CO<sub>2</sub> and water; the ensuing fall in extracellular osmolality leads to water movement into the cells.</p><p/><p>The net effect is that concurrent administration of potassium must be taken into account when estimating the sodium deficit and anticipating the rate of correction of the hyponatremia. This relationship becomes clinically important in the patient with severe diuretic or vomiting-induced hyponatremia who is also hypokalemic.</p><p>Suppose, for example, that a patient with hyponatremia has a serum potassium concentration of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and that it is decided to give 400 mEq of oral potassium during the first day. If the patient is a 70 kg man, the total body water (TBW) will be approximately 40 liters (60 percent of body weight). Using the equations presented below, the administered potassium will raise the serum sodium concentration by approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> which exceeds the upper limit for the rate of safe correction. Thus, giving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> alone will correct <strong>both</strong> the hyponatremia and the hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

There are multiple receptors for the ADH vasopressin: the V1a, V1b, and V2 receptors. The V2 receptors primarily mediate the antidiuretic response, while V1a and V1b receptors principally cause vasoconstriction and mediate adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/17,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,49</a>].</p><p>The vasopressin receptor antagonists produce a selective water diuresis (also called aquaresis) without affecting sodium and potassium excretion.

Isotonic saline will initially raise the serum sodium more slowly than hypertonic saline (until near-euvolemia is attained and ADH secretion is suppressed). In addition, some patients with hypovolemia may have coexistent syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH) due to stress and will not respond well to isotonic saline. Thus, hypertonic saline will be predictably more effective in rapidly alleviated symptoms of severe hyponatremia. After euvolemia is established, the slow correction in patients receiving isotonic saline may accelerate due to suppression of ADH, leading to a marked water diuresis. This rapid rise in serum sodium in patients who were, until that point, correcting slowly may produce an excessive 24-hour increase in the serum sodium. Initial therapy with a combination of hypertonic saline and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (dDAVP) can quickly improve symptoms of hyponatremia while preventing overly rapid correction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3635730389\"><span class=\"h3\">Do not use isotonic saline in edematous patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isotonic saline should <strong>not </strong>be used to treat hyponatremia associated with edematous disorders.

Assuming the patient is euvolemic, the administered sodium is excreted in the urine because the response to aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide is normal. However, the water is retained because of the persistent action of ADH. Thus, when 1 liter of isotonic saline is administered to a patient with SIADH, the sodium is excreted in the urine while some of the water is retained, worsening the hyponatremia.</p><p>A few simple calculations can illustrate this point. Suppose a patient with SIADH and hyponatremia has a high, relatively fixed urine osmolality and a urine cation concentration (urine [Na] + urine [K]) of 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> which is twice the cation concentration of isotonic saline. If 1000 mL of isotonic saline is given (containing 154 mEq of sodium), all of the NaCl will be excreted (because sodium handling is intact) but in only 500 mL of water (154 mEq of urinary sodium in 500 mL equals 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>.

Potassium added to the solution should be included in the formula (ie, &quot;Infusate [Na + K]&quot; rather than &quot;Infusate [Na]&quot;) since potassium is as osmotically active as sodium and will therefore contribute to the elevation in serum sodium (see <a href=\"#H3994661758\" class=\"local\">'Potassium replacement in hypokalemic patients'</a> above):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Increase in SNa &#160;= &#160;(Infusate [Na + K] &ndash; SNa) &#160;&divide; &#160;(TBW + 1)</p></div></div><p>Because TBW in liters is approximately 0.5 x body weight in kg and because each mL of 3 percent (hypertonic) saline contains 0.5 mEq of sodium, a simplified version of the formula predicts:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> body weight of 3 percent saline &#160;= &#160;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> increase in SNa</p></div></div><p>However, these formulas have a number of limitations and <strong>cannot be used </strong>to accurately predict the magnitude of change in serum sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p>When hypertonic saline is given, the increase in serum sodium is often greater than that predicted by the formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. As an example, in a series of 62 patients with a baseline serum sodium of 112 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> who were treated with hypertonic saline, 74 percent had a rise in serum sodium greater than expected from the above formulas. In addition, the maximum recommended rate of correction at 24 and 48 hours was exceeded in 11 and 10 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Inadvertent overcorrection was due to a documented water diuresis in 40 percent of patients, which, as mentioned above, can occur when saline therapy corrects hypovolemia, thereby removing the hypovolemic stimulus to the release of ADH and permitting rapid excretion of the excess water.</p><p>By contrast, in patients with persistent SIADH secretion, the administered sodium will be excreted in the urine, and some of the water will be retained; as a result, the increase in serum sodium after 3 percent saline will be less than that predicted by formulas, and the serum sodium may actually fall after isotonic saline. Suppose, for example, a 60 kg woman with SIADH and hyponatremia (serum sodium of 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> has a high, relatively fixed urine osmolality and a urine cation concentration (urine [Na] + urine [K]) of 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> which is twice the cation concentration of isotonic saline. If 1000 mL of hypertonic saline (513 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> is given, all of the NaCl will be excreted but now in 1665 mL of urine (513 &divide; 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. Thus, after the administration of hypertonic saline, there will be an initial large rise in the serum sodium concentration, followed by reduction toward baseline after the administered sodium has been excreted. At this time, the rise in the serum sodium due to the net loss of 665 mL of water can be calculated. For these calculations, the initial TBW is assumed to be 50 percent of body weight (30 L), and the baseline total exchangeable cations are assumed to equal the product of TBW and the serum sodium concentration (30 L x 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> = 3300 mEq). With these assumptions:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;New SNa &#160;= &#160;Total exchangeable cations &#160;&divide; &#160;TBW<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; = &#160;3300 L (same as baseline) &#160;&divide; &#160;29.3 L (665 mL loss) &#160;= &#160;113 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L<br/></span></p></div></div><p>The 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> rise in serum sodium is considerably less than that predicted by the formulas above, which, if used, would have erroneously predicted the following effects of 1000 mL of hypertonic saline:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;(Infusate [Na] &ndash; SNa) &#160;&divide; &#160;(TBW + 1) &#160;= &#160;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or<br/> &#160;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> body weight of 3 percent saline &#160;= &#160;17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p></div></div><p>Predictive formulas can, however, be valuable adjuncts to therapy. If the increase in serum sodium is more than predicted by the formula, one should suspect that an increase in water excretion has occurred because the original cause for water retention has ended (eg, euvolemia has been restored in a patient with hypovolemic hyponatremia or dDVAP has worn off in a patient with dDVAP-induced hyponatremia). Such a deviation of the actual increase in serum sodium from the predicted increase should prompt strict monitoring of urine output and, in many cases, replacement of water losses or treatment with dDVAP to stop them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4112148041\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Although some correction of hyponatremia is usually indicated in patients with severe hyponatremia, the goal of initial therapy is to raise the serum sodium concentration by 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a 24-hour period.

Patients who are treated for chronic hyponatremia in the hospital should have their serum sodium measured often enough to ensure an appropriate rate of correction and to allow the clinician to react quickly to impending overly rapid correction (eg, every four hours).
