The OPTIMAAL trial compared the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> (50 mg three times daily) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> (50 mg once daily) in 5770 high-risk patients after an acute ST elevation anterior infarction or reinfarction or after any MI associated with heart failure (HF) during the acute phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-acute-myocardial-infarction-clinical-trials/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The last two side effects are unusual with ACE inhibitors other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a>.</p><p/><p>The VALIANT trial found no difference in efficacy between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> in patients with HF occurring within 10 days after an acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-acute-myocardial-infarction-clinical-trials/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This study included 14,808 patients with an acute MI (two-thirds with an ST elevation MI [STEMI]) within the prior 10 days complicated by clinical or radiologic signs of HF, evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or both. Patients were randomly assigned to valsartan (target dose 160 mg twice daily), captopril (target dose 50 mg three times daily), or both agents (target regimen 80 mg valsartan twice daily and 50 mg captopril three times daily).</p><p>At a median follow-up of 25 months, there was no difference among the three groups (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a>, or both) in the primary end point of all-cause mortality (19.9, 19.5, and 19.3 percent, respectively) or in the incidence of cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, or hospitalization for HF (31.1, 31.1, and 31.9 percent, respectively). A noninferiority test confirmed that valsartan and captopril had equivalent efficacy.</p><p>ARBs likely reduce the incidence of MI to the same degree as ACE inhibitors; in VALIANT, the rate of reinfarction was similar in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-acute-myocardial-infarction-clinical-trials/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The magnitude of this benefit can be estimated using a meta-analysis that found that ACE inhibitors significantly reduced the incidence of reinfarction compared to placebo (10.8 versus 13.2 percent, odds ratio 0.80) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-acute-myocardial-infarction-clinical-trials/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Thus, neither OPTIMAAL nor VALIANT found ARBs to be superior to ACE inhibitors in patients with an acute MI. Based upon VALIANT, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> at a dose of 160 mg twice daily appears to be as effective as an ACE inhibitor for reduction in mortality after an MI. It is possible that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> at a higher dose than that used in OPTIMAAL (eg, 100 mg once daily) would be similarly effective, although this has not been proven directly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-acute-myocardial-infarction-clinical-trials/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination with ACE inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned in the preceding section, the VALIANT trial did not find a benefit of combined therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> compared to monotherapy with either drug alone in patients with HF occurring within 10 days after an acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-acute-myocardial-infarction-clinical-trials/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Adverse events leading to a reduction in drug dose occurred more frequently with combination therapy than with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> alone (34.8 versus 29.4 and 28.4 percent).
