When a virus infects the intestines and causes diarrhea and vomiting, doctors call it &quot;viral gastroenteritis.&quot; In children, rotavirus is a common cause of viral gastroenteritis.</p><p>Children can get a rotavirus infection if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touch an infected person or a surface with the virus on it, and then don't wash their hands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat foods or drink liquids with the virus in them. If people with a rotavirus infection don't wash their hands, they can spread it to food or liquid they touch.</p><p/><p>Adults can also get a rotavirus infection, but it is much more common in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203812256\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a rotavirus infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rotavirus infection commonly causes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that is watery but not bloody</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>If your child has vomiting or diarrhea, his or her body can lose too much water. Doctors call this &quot;dehydration.&quot; Symptoms of dehydration can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer wet diapers, or dark yellow or brown urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No tears when a child cries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dry mouth or cracked lips</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyes that look sunken in the face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;sunken fontanel&quot; (in babies) &ndash; A fontanel is a gap between the bones in a baby's skull. When babies are dehydrated, the fontanel on the top of their head can look or feel caved in.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203812263\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my child's doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your child's doctor or nurse if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has any symptoms of dehydration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has diarrhea or vomiting that lasts longer than a few days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomits up blood, has bloody diarrhea, or has severe belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hasn't had anything to drink in a few hours, or can't keep fluids down</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hasn't needed to urinate in the past 6 to 8 hours (in older children), or hasn't had a wet diaper for 4 to 6 hours (in babies and young children)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is urinating much more than usual</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203812271\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. The doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your child has a rotavirus infection by learning about his or her symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>He or she might also do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests on a sample of your child's bowel movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or urine tests to check for dehydration</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203812278\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a rotavirus infection treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children do not need any treatment, because their symptoms will get better on their own. But it's important to make sure your child drinks enough fluids so that he or she doesn't get dehydrated. You'll know that you are giving your child enough fluids when his or her urine looks pale yellow or clear, or when your baby has a normal amount of wet diapers.</p><p>To prevent dehydration, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your baby or young child an &quot;oral rehydration solution&quot; (such as Pedialyte). You can buy this in a grocery store or pharmacy. If your child is vomiting, you can try to give him or her a few teaspoons of fluid every few minutes. In general, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a> work better than juice, because juice sometimes makes diarrhea worse. But you can also try giving your child apple juice mixed with an equal amount of water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continue to breastfeed your baby, if he or she breastfeeds.</p><p/><p>You should NOT give your child medicines to stop diarrhea (anti-diarrhea medicines). These medicines can make the infection last longer.</p><p>If your child has a severe infection and gets dehydrated, he or she might need to be treated in the hospital. In the hospital, the doctor might give your child fluids into his or her vein through a tube called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203812285\"><span class=\"h1\">Can a rotavirus infection be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors recommend that all babies get a vaccine to prevent the rotavirus infection. Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections. There are 2 main types of rotavirus vaccines. Depending on the type your baby gets, he or she will need either 2 or 3 doses of the vaccine.</p><p>If your child has a rotavirus infection, you can prevent spreading the infection by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Washing your hands with soap after you change your child's diaper</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not changing your child's diaper near where you prepare food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting diapers in a sealed bag before you throw them out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleaning the diaper changing area with alcohol or with a bleach and water mixture</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203812335\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-gastroenteritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Viral gastroenteritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dehydration-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dehydration in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food poisoning (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
