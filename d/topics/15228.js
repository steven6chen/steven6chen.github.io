No randomized trials have been conducted; instead, the evidence is based upon observational studies that can yield associations confounded by measured and residual (unmeasured) factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-use-of-antidepressants-and-risk-of-teratogenicity-and-adverse-pregnancy-outcomes-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. Observational studies include retrospective case-control studies, which carry the risk of recall bias. In addition, population based registry studies typically rely upon prescription databases that may misclassify exposure, given that women may not take a prescribed drug. Some studies did not precisely define outcomes, or grouped together different types of malformations across a range of severity from mild to severe. Other studies did not specify the antidepressant dose or timing of use during the antenatal period. Some observed associations between exposure and outcome are based upon a small number of exposed and affected infants, and some associations may occur by chance due to an excessive number of comparisons. </p><p>Associations between fetal exposure to antidepressants and adverse outcomes that are found in observational studies may be confounded by many factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-use-of-antidepressants-and-risk-of-teratogenicity-and-adverse-pregnancy-outcomes-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris/abstract/10,11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women who were psychiatrically ill and took antidepressants were often compared with pregnant women who were healthy; thus, observed associations between prenatal exposure to antidepressants and pregnancy outcomes may be confounded by exposure to maternal psychiatric illness. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another potential confound is severity of illness; among pregnant women with depression or anxiety, the mental disorder is typically more severe in patients who are prescribed antidepressants than patients not prescribed antidepressants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other potential confounds in women prescribed antidepressants for a particular disorder include comorbid general medical and psychiatric illnesses, and use of other medications (eg, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascertainment (surveillance) bias may exist such that congenital defects, which might have otherwise gone undetected, are discovered in offspring of women using antidepressants because they are more likely to undergo prenatal and postnatal ultrasonography, echocardiography, and thorough postnatal physical examination.
