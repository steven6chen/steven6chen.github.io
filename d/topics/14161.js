An open four-gland parathyroid exploration has traditionally been considered the gold standard for patients undergoing surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. However, a more focused, minimally invasive approach to parathyroid surgery has been adopted at many centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Localization techniques are primarily used in patients who have biochemically confirmed sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism to identify patients who are candidates for a minimally invasive approach. They are also important in patients who have persistent or recurrent disease, or who have had prior cervical exploration and require remedial surgery. Patients with hereditary primary hyperparathyroidism generally undergo bilateral parathyroid exploration, even in the event of a positive localizing study, because of the potential for asymmetric hyperplasia. Localization studies, in conjunction with intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing, can help minimize the extent of surgical dissection, identify concurrent thyroid pathology, and detect ectopic parathyroid tissue, the latter being a particular advantage for patients who had prior failed parathyroid exploration. However, localization studies should not be used to diagnose or confirm the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism or determine the need for surgery. Use of localization studies does not override the recommendation that parathyroid surgery should only be performed by highly experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].</p><p>The techniques and role of preoperative localization in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism will be reviewed here. Decision making regarding the role of surgical therapy, the details of surgical management in these patients, and the role of surgery for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with end-stage renal disease is discussed elsewhere.

Imaging studies are not used as a diagnostic tool because of high false-positive rates, which can range from 5 to 25 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88628 \">table 1</a>). In addition, a single-focus positive imaging result does not reliably exclude the presence of multiglandular parathyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rather, preoperative localization studies help plan the operative approach in patients who have a biochemically confirmed diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism, and in whom other pathologies have been appropriately ruled out (eg, familial benign hypercalcemic hypocalciuria). For patients undergoing initial surgery, these studies are predominantly used to determine whether or not a patient is a candidate for a minimally invasive approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

Localization images should be displayed and available intraoperatively, since review during exploration often usefully guides successful surgery.

The success of a minimally invasive approach is highly dependent upon accurate imaging results, which aid in limiting the dissection to the region where the adenoma has been localized. For every parathyroid operation, the goal is cure of the biochemical condition, and, thus, intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay should be used to confirm success of the operation by demonstrating a substantial drop in parathyroid hormone level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].

In such cases, the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism should be confirmed biochemically, and indications for surgery should be reevaluated. Accurate localization studies are mandatory in patients undergoing reoperative surgery. Because of fibrosis from the previous surgery and alterations in parathyroid gland location, the rate of complications, such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, permanent hypoparathyroidism, and persistent disease, is typically higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>Two or more concordant preoperative imaging studies, such as sestamibi scan, sestamibi with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), ultrasound, and four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT), should localize hyperfunctional parathyroid tissue to the same region before proceeding with re-exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The success rate of reoperative surgery without preoperative localization is only 60 percent. Several observational studies have reported success rates of 95 percent or more with the use of preoperative localization before reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/15,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,20</a>]. Almost 30 percent of patients undergoing reoperation have multiple gland disease. Thus, localization studies identifying an apparent single adenoma do not exclude the existence of abnormal parathyroid glands in other locations.</p><p>The best imaging study or combination of studies for persistent disease has not been determined. The two largest studies included 288 and 102 patients and compared sestamibi scans, thallium-technetium scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, and selective venous catheterization or other invasive tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Sestamibi scans detected 67 to 77 percent of the abnormal glands with few false positives; the other noninvasive studies detected slightly fewer lesions in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] but 15 to 20 percent fewer in the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A subsequent study of 90 patients who required reoperative surgery reported equivalent postoperative cure rates but shorter operative times when 4D-CT was used for preoperative localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound- or CT-guided fine needle aspiration of suspicious lesions for PTH assay can be performed to confirm that the lesion is parathyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In a study of 44 patients, fine needle aspiration with PTH assay had a specificity and sensitivity of 100 and 70 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Fine needle aspiration should not be performed if the diagnosis of parathyroid cancer is considered likely, as seeding of the cancer is a potential complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Selective arterial or venous angiography is usually the next localization modality used if multiple noninvasive imaging techniques fail to identify an abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>Algorithms for the evaluation of patients undergoing reoperation have been developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78548\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78548 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. These algorithms, which are based upon clinical experience, suggest performing two noninvasive procedures prior to reoperation, one of which should be sestamibi imaging. The other is often ultrasonography, but choice is dictated by available expertise. If the results of these studies are concordant, surgery is performed. If the results are discordant or inconclusive, the next step depends upon the expertise of the referral center and may include either surgery with intraoperative monitoring of PTH or additional testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Further testing includes additional imaging (CT, MRI) or possible invasive procedures (selective venous sampling). Several observational studies showed that this approach allowed the identification of the offending parathyroid gland or glands in 92 to 97 percent of reoperated cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/20,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H238329446\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilateral neck exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral parathyroid exploration should be planned when imaging studies are negative or show more than one focus of activity, in cases of secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, suspected hereditary etiology, or when concurrent thyroid pathology is present and warrants surgery.

However, SPECT is not available at all centers, and some use planar sestamibi as the initial localizing study. Additional complementary techniques are needed for patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">persistent/recurrent</span> disease or inconclusive results on sestamibi or SPECT scanning. Imaging modalities that have also been used successfully include ultrasound, SPECT combined with computed tomography (MIBI-SPECT-CT fusion), 4D-CT, and 11C-methionine positron emission tomography (PET) combined with CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/24,36,38-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,36,38-43</a>]. The utility of these tests is discussed in the following sections. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of the imaging modalities are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88628 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2890373\"><span class=\"h2\">Sestamibi scintigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technetium-99m-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-sestamibi or MIBI) was first used for cardiac scintigraphy and was noted to concentrate in parathyroid adenomas. 99mTc-sestamibi is taken up by the mitochondria in thyroid and parathyroid tissue; however, the radiotracer is retained by the mitochondria-rich oxyphil cells in parathyroid glands longer than in thyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Planar images are typically obtained shortly after injection of 99mTc-sestamibi and again at approximately two hours to identify foci of retained radiotracer activity consistent with hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue. Sestamibi scintigraphy alone provides limited anatomic detail. </p><p>A negative 99mTc sestamibi scan does not preclude the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism, since it occurs in 12 to 25 percent of patients with disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Sestamibi scanning is often unrevealing, or misleading, in patients with parathyroid hyperplasia, multiple parathyroid adenomas, and coexisting thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/9,47-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,47-53</a>]. Thyroid disease requiring surgery significantly increases both the false positive and false negative rate of sestamibi scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

This is a common problem, since concurrent thyroid pathology is present in 20 to 30 percent of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Concurrent thyroid disease should be addressed preoperatively (eg, with fine needle aspiration) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraoperatively (eg, with concurrent thyroidectomy). In addition, US-directed fine needle aspiration biopsy with analysis of PTH levels can be helpful for confirming suspected parathyroid lesions such as intrathyroidal adenomas or cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>Most experts in parathyroid surgery rely on both US and SPECT for preoperative localization, although this varies by geography and institutional expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/14,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,71,72</a>]. Combining 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy with neck ultrasound provides high sensitivity (79 to 95 percent) for predicting the location of a single parathyroid adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/58,59,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59,73</a>].

In a cost analysis study, initial ultrasound is the most cost-effective imaging modality, followed by 4D-CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. No imaging technique, even in combination, accurately predicts multiglandular disease, and a bilateral neck exploration should be strongly considered when the studies are discordant, equivocal, or negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/47,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,77</a>].</p><p>Disadvantages to the use of US alone include decreased accuracy in patients with smaller parathyroid gland size, obesity, or mediastinal glands located behind the clavicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6958652\"><span class=\"h2\">Four-dimensional computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) scans take advantage of the rapid contrast uptake and washout that is characteristic of parathyroid adenomas for precise anatomic localization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82115\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82115 \">image 4</a>). The primary disadvantage of 4D-CT is the radiation exposure, which, compared with sestamibi imaging, results in a &gt;50-fold higher dose of radiation absorbed by the thyroid. The additional radiation leads to an age-dependent higher risk of developing thyroid cancer; hence, the use of 4D-CT should be highly selective in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Most protocols include noncontrast images followed by additional acquisitions (up to three) after contrast injection. However, protocols vary by center, and some utilize fewer acquisitions to limit the radiation exposure. In a meta-analysis inclusive of 34 published studies that evaluated CT imaging for parathyroid adenoma localization using a wide variety of protocols, each additional imaging acquisition resulted in a marginal increase in the pooled sensitivity for abnormal gland lateralization (sensitivity of single phase, 71 percent; 2-phase, 76 percent; 3-phase, 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. </p><p>4D-CT is particularly useful in the reoperative setting when initial imaging with sestamibi is negative. In a study of 45 patients who had undergone previous neck exploration, 4D-CT had 88 percent sensitivity for abnormal parathyroid glands compared with sestamibi SPECT or neck US (54 and 21 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2891789\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parathyroid adenoma characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) include intermediate to low signal intensity on T1 imaging and high intensity on T2 imaging.

Risks associated with invasive localization procedures include groin hematoma, anaphylaxis from the iodinated contrast, contrast-induced acute renal failure, and stroke. They are also expensive and require an experienced interventional radiologist to perform.
