It is distressing for the infant, the parents, and the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The parents may view the crying as evidence of illness or as an indictment of their caregiving ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Colic is a benign self-limited condition that resolves with time. However, the family's beliefs concerning the cause of crying and their interactions with the health care system related to the crying may affect the way in which they view the child and the health care system long after the crying has resolved.</p><p>The clinical features, etiology, and diagnosis of prolonged or excessive crying in young infants are reviewed here. The management is discussed separately.

In a meta-analysis of 28 studies of diaries documenting the duration of fussing and crying in 8690 infants, mean duration of crying was 117 to 133 minutes per day during the first six weeks of life and decreased to 68 minutes per day by 10 to 12 weeks, but varied widely from infant to infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Few people agree as to how much crying is considered excessive. In the meta-analysis of 28 studies described above, the approximate 95<sup>th</sup> percentile duration of crying ranged from 225 to 250 minutes per day during the first six weeks of life, after which it decreased to 210 minutes per day at 8 to 9 weeks and 145 minutes per day at 10 to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One author argues that a cutoff point based upon duration is wrong in principle and not helpful clinically because &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; crying depend upon the context and quality of crying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, adhering to a strict definition is not helpful to the families whose child does not meet the definition of abnormal.</p><p>As patterns of crying are better delineated and understood, clinicians may be better prepared to help parents cope when an identifiable organic etiology is not found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Colic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no standard definition for the term &quot;colic.&quot; For clinical purposes, we define it broadly as crying for no apparent reason that lasts for &ge;3 hours per day and occurs on &ge;3 days per week in an otherwise healthy infant &lt;3 months of age. The broad definition considers the variety of parental experiences, thresholds of concern, and perspectives that ultimately shape the relationship between the parent(s) and child. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-colic-management-and-outcome#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile colic: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>Other terms that may be used interchangeably with colic include &quot;cry-fuss behavior,&quot; &quot;excessive crying,&quot; &quot;unsettled infant behavior,&quot; and &quot;period of PURPLE crying&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Stricter definitions for colic, often used in clinical research, may include criteria for minimum duration (eg, one week, three weeks, etc) or associated clinical features.</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Wessel criteria specify that episodes of crying must last for &ge;3 hours per day, occur on &ge;3 days per week, and persist for &ge;3 weeks (&quot;rule of three&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Wessel's criteria also require that the infant is &quot;otherwise healthy and well fed.&quot; The criterion of persistence for three weeks has been dropped by most authors because few parents or clinicians are able to wait three weeks before evaluation or intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Rome IV criteria, which classify infant colic as a functional gastrointestinal disorder in infants from birth to five months of age, require all of the following: 1) age &lt;5 months when the symptoms start and stop; 2) recurrent and prolonged periods of crying, fussing, or irritability that start and stop without obvious cause and cannot be prevented or resolved by caregivers; 3) no evidence of failure to thrive, fever, or illness; 4) caregiver reports <span class=\"nowrap\">crying/fussing</span> for &ge;3 hours per day on &ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week</span> in a telephone or face-to-face interview; and 5) total daily crying is confirmed to be &ge;3 hours when measured by at least one prospectively kept 24-hour diary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another definition requires that episodes of crying meet Wessel criteria (including persistence for &ge;3 weeks) and at least three of the following: paroxysmal; qualitatively different from normal crying (eg, louder, higher and more variable in pitch, more dysphonic); associated with features of hypertonia; inconsolability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The wide range is due to differences in diagnostic criteria, study design, populations, and family perceptions of &quot;excessive and prolonged&quot; crying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>]. As an example, only 35 percent of infants considered to be &quot;colicky&quot; by their mothers met the &quot;rule of three&quot; criteria when parental diaries were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 parental diary studies, including 8690 infants, colic (defined as <span class=\"nowrap\">crying/fussing</span> for &ge;3 hours per day on &ge;3 days in any one week) was documented in 17 to 25 percent of infants age &lt;6 weeks, 11 percent of those age 8 to 9 weeks, and 0.6 percent of those age 10 to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The incidence of colic does not appear to differ among males and females, breast- and formula-fed infants, or full-term and preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Some investigators have noted an increased incidence of colic in first-born children and siblings of colicky children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; others have found no such relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Some researchers have suggested that colic occurs only in industrialized countries and is more frequent in Caucasian infants and in areas at greater distance from the equator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>].</p><p>Associations between colic and dissatisfaction in the marital relationship, parental perception of stress, lack of parental self-confidence during the pregnancy, dissatisfaction with the delivery, and levels of family stress have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>]. The causal relationship between colic and family stress is difficult to determine because both factors affect parental perception of, and response to, crying.</p><p>A complex interaction exists between colic and family dynamics, which also are affected by pre- and postnatal factors. In a case-control study, families with colicky infants had more problems in family structure, functioning, and affective state both during the colicky period and one year later than control families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPOSED ETIOLOGIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20171425\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of colic is unknown. It probably represents a final common pathway for numerous contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Proposed etiologies must account for the age of onset, the individual variability, the nonrandom distribution throughout the day (eg, the tendency to cluster during the evening), and the spontaneous resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Gastrointestinal, biologic, and psychosocial etiologies have been proposed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colic is commonly thought to be a gastrointestinal disturbance; the word &quot;colic&quot; stems from the Greek &quot;kolikos,&quot; the adjective of &quot;kolon&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Gastrointestinal factors that are proposed to contribute to colic include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Faulty feeding techniques</strong> &ndash; Underfeeding, overfeeding, infrequent burping, and swallowing air all have been described as possible etiologies of colic. One study found that infants fed with an antivacuum bottle spent more time awake and content than did those who were fed with a conventional bottle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cow's milk protein intolerance</strong> &ndash; The evidence for an association between cow's milk protein intolerance and colic is equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, it is reasonable to assume that a subgroup of infants with colic have symptoms that are caused at least in part by allergy to either casein or whey. Systematic reviews of small randomized trials with methodologic limitations (eg, inadequate blinding) suggest hydrolysate formulas or a hypoallergenic diet for breastfeeding mothers may reduce distress in infants with colic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lactose intolerance</strong> &ndash; It is unclear whether lactose intolerance plays a role in infantile colic. Randomized trials of lactase treatment for infantile colic have conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal immaturity</strong> &ndash; Another theory proposes that colic is related to the incomplete absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine related to intestinal immaturity. Excessive gas is produced when the unabsorbed carbohydrate is fermented by colonic bacteria. Evidence for this theory is inconclusive. Studies measuring breath hydrogen excretion in infants with and without colic have inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intestinal hypermotility</strong> &ndash; Intestinal hypermotility secondary to a presumed autonomic imbalance also has been proposed as an etiology for colic. The evidence for this hypothesis is contradictory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and gastrin levels do not appear to be elevated in infants with colic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, in case-control studies, motilin concentrations were increased in colicky infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Motilin stimulates gastric emptying and intestinal peristalsis, thereby reducing transit time in the small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Further support for the role of motilin in colic is provided by a prospective study in which motilin concentrations were greater in colicky than noncolicky infants on day 1 of life and at 6 and 12 weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alterations in fecal microflora</strong> &ndash; Alterations in fecal microflora may play a role in infantile colic. Several observational studies have demonstrated differences in intestinal microflora between infants with colic and control infants, particularly <em>Klebsiella</em> species, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, coliform bacteria, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and <em>Lactobacillus </em>species (<em>L. brevis</em> and <em>L. lactis</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. One study also found a twofold increase in fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal neutrophil infiltration, among colicky infants compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and another noted decreased fecal calprotectin levels as colicky symptoms improved over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of fecal microflora in colic is supported by randomized trials comparing <em>L. reuteri</em> and placebo in breastfed or predominantly breastfed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-54</a>]. Treatment with <em>L. reuteri</em> was associated with a greater reduction in crying per day, increased fecal Lactobacilli, and decreased fecal <em>E. coli</em>, suggesting that <em>L. reuteri</em> may promote gut health by reducing <em>E. coli</em> colonization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-colic-management-and-outcome#H353072414\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile colic: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Probiotics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biologic factors that are proposed to contribute to colic include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immature motor regulation</strong> &ndash; Many of the mechanisms that regulate motor activity are immature in infants. The immaturity of these mechanisms may result in increased vulnerability to feeding intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Thus, colic may be a common clinical manifestation in the subpopulation of infants who have maturational dysfunction in one or more of the aspects of motility regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased serotonin</strong> &ndash; Random urinary concentrations of 5-hydroxy-3-indole acetic acid (5-OH IAA), a serotonin metabolite, were measured in infants with and without colic in a study designed to investigate the pathogenesis of colic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Urinary 5-OH IAA concentrations were greater in infants with colic than in control infants, suggesting that elevated serotonin concentrations may play a role.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tobacco smoke and nicotine exposure</strong> &ndash; Maternal smoking during pregnancy or in the postpartum period has been associated with an increased risk of infantile colic in several cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. In the largest study, the prevalence of colic (using Wessel criteria) was 9.4 percent among infants of smokers versus 7.3 percent among infants of nonsmokers (adjusted odds ratio 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Prenatal exposure to nicotine replacement therapy also was associated with an increased risk of infantile colic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early form of migraine</strong> &ndash; Infantile colic may be an early manifestation of childhood migraine. In a prospective cohort, migraine without aura was more common in adolescents with infantile colic than in those without infantile colic (multivariate risk ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.5-4.7); colic was not associated with an increased risk of migraine with aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. These findings confirm those of retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-66</a>], although it is not clear whether infantile colic is an early manifestation of childhood migraine or a marker of migraine genetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colic is a psychosocial phenomenon. It is the caretaker's perception of what is excessive and prolonged and the caretaker's ultimate response to these episodes that define whether the crying is seen as a problem. Psychosocial theories of colic focus on temperament, overstimulation, and parental variables.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Temperament</strong> &ndash; Healthy behavior and development are believed to be predicted on the &quot;goodness of fit&quot; between the child's environment and his or her innate characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>]. Evidence supporting this theory is limited. The most direct evidence comes from therapeutic trials aimed at modifying parental behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. In one controlled clinical trial, when parents of colicky infants were counseled regarding effective responses to crying, the crying decreased from 2.6 to 0.8 hours per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In another, parental counseling was more effective than dietary changes (crying decreased from 3.2 to 1.1 hours per day in the counseling group and from 3.2 to 2 hours per day in the dietary change group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypersensitivity</strong> &ndash; Another proposed hypothesis is that crying at the end of the day represents discharge after a long day of exposure to environmental stimuli and is a means of maintaining homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parental variables</strong> &ndash; Various parental psychosocial factors, including family stress, maternal anxiety, and transmission of tension from the mother to the infant, have been proposed to be associated with colic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,76,77</a>]. A prospective study found an association between maternal anxiety disorder and excessive infant crying after controlling for potential confounders (eg, maternal age, marital status, education, and parity; gestational age and birth weight, type of delivery, sex) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Another prospective study supported an association between infantile colic and a history of emotional tension or depression early in the pregnancy that had been noted in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Paternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy have also been associated with excessive crying in infants, even after controlling for maternal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9932632\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are differences of opinion regarding whether what is called &quot;colic&quot; is the upper end of the normal range of crying or a discrete disorder with unique clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>].</p><p>We use the following clinical features to distinguish colic from normal crying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paroxysms</strong> &ndash; The <span class=\"nowrap\">cry/fuss</span> behavior of colic generally is paroxysmal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,83</a>]. Colicky episodes typically have a clear beginning and end.
