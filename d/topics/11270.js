Approximately 140,250 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States, of which 97,220 originate in the colon, and the rest originate in the rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Annually, approximately 50,630 Americans die of CRC, accounting for approximately 9 percent of all cancer deaths; in the United States, CRC ranks third in both incidence and cause of cancer death in both men and women. Global, country-specific data on incidence and mortality are available from the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/Map.aspx&amp;token=0fC2KlWP2lBbCApZ6DyKw47MnQXaSNBIvsugca7gMSw+6djwprsRosUIl828CRp5&amp;TOPIC_ID=2485\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GLOBOCAN database</a>.</p><p>The risk factors for CRC are both environmental and inherited. The mode of presentation of CRC follows one of three patterns that are reflective of these differing risk factors: sporadic, inherited, and familial:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sporadic disease, in which there is no family history, accounts for approximately 70 percent of all CRCs. It is most common over the age of 50, and dietary and environmental factors have been etiologically implicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer than 10 percent of patients have a true inherited predisposition to CRC, and these cases are subdivided according to whether or not colonic polyps are a major disease manifestation. The diseases with polyposis include familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), and the hamartomatous polyposis syndromes (eg, Peutz-Jeghers, juvenile polyposis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTEN] hamartoma tumor [Cowden] syndrome), while those without polyposis are referred to as hereditary nonpolyposis CRC (HNPCC; Lynch syndrome). These conditions are all associated with a high risk of developing CRC. In many cases, the causative genetic mutation has been identified, and a test is available.

Affected patients have a family history of CRC, but the pattern is not consistent with one of the inherited syndromes described above. Individuals from these families are at increased risk of developing CRC, although the risk is not as high as with the inherited syndromes. Having a single affected first-degree relative (ie, parent, child, sibling) increases the risk of developing CRC 1.7-fold over that of the general population. The risk is further increased if two first-degree relatives have CRC or if the index case is diagnosed before age 55.

However, the term &quot;familial&quot; colorectal cancer syndrome is probably a misnomer as it is likely that these patients have a currently unidentified inherited genetic mutation.

Specific germline mutations are responsible for the inherited CRC syndromes, while a stepwise accumulation of somatic mutations is thought to underlie most sporadic cases. In contrast, the genetic abnormalities underlying &quot;familial&quot; CRC remain incompletely understood.</p><p>This topic will review the major genetic aspects of colorectal carcinogenesis, with particular emphasis on sporadic CRC. Inherited conditions that significantly increase the risk of CRC (eg, FAP and Lynch syndrome) and the role of genetic testing and screening for patients with an inherited predisposition are discussed elsewhere.

Genetic mutations can be inherited or acquired. Any genetic mutation that occurs at or before fertilization of the ovum is termed a germline mutation and can be transmitted from parent to offspring as an inherited defect. If the mutation occurs spontaneously in the sperm, ovum, or zygote, the affected person's parents do not manifest the cancer phenotype, but future progeny may inherit the de novo mutation. More commonly, a spontaneous mutation appears in a cell during the growth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> development of a particular tissue or organ; this is called a somatic mutation. Because these mutations often confer a selective growth advantage, they result in preferential proliferation of the cell containing the mutated genetic material (clonal evolution) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The clonal nature of tumors is a critical feature of the somatic <span class=\"nowrap\">mutation/clonal</span> evolution theory of human carcinogenesis. According to this model, the growth advantage acquired by a single mutated cell allows its progeny to outnumber those of neighboring cells. From within this clonal population, a single cell acquires a second mutation, providing an additional growth advantage that allows further clonal expansion. Subsequent waves of clonal expansion are driven by the sequential acquisition of more mutations, further cellular disorganization, and eventually the ability to invade and metastasize.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">The adenoma-carcinoma sequence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most human CRCs are thought to arise from adenomas (adenomatous polyps) that become dysplastic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56774\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56774 \">figure 1</a>). Adenomatous polyps form in the colon when normal mechanisms regulating epithelial renewal are disrupted. Surface cells lining the intestine are continuously lost into the bowel lumen due to apoptosis and exfoliation, and must be continuously replaced. Typically, proliferation occurs exclusively at the crypt base. As cells move towards the luminal surface, they cease proliferating and terminally differentiate. This ordered process is increasingly disrupted as adenomas increase in size, become dysplastic, and eventually attain invasive potential.</p><p>The hypothesis that invasive CRCs develop from intermediate precancerous precursors is supported by pathologic, epidemiologic, and observational clinical data (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-polyps#H874888799\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon polyps&quot;, section on 'Adenomatous polyps'</a>). Summarized briefly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early carcinomas are frequently seen within large adenomatous polyps, and areas of adenomatous change can often be found surrounding human CRCs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenomas and carcinomas are found in similar distributions throughout the large bowel, and adenomas are typically observed 10 to 15 years prior to the onset of cancer in both sporadic and familial cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In animal models, adenomas develop before carcinomas, and carcinomas develop exclusively in adenomatous tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability to reduce the incidence of CRC through removal of polyps has been shown in controlled trials in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p>In 1990, Fearon and Vogelstein described the molecular basis for CRC as a multistep process in which each accumulated genetic event conferred a selective growth advantage to the colonic epithelial cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Later studies have served to further refine their hypothesis.</p><p>According to the Vogelstein model, germline or somatic mutations are required for malignant transformation, and the accumulation of multiple genetic mutations rather than their sequence determines the biological behavior of the tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55601 \">figure 2</a>). Germline mutations underlie the common inherited syndromes (eg, familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP], Lynch syndrome), while sporadic cancers result from the stepwise accumulation of multiple somatic mutations. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (<em>APC</em>) gene, a feature common to both inherited and sporadic CRCs, occur early in the process, while p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations generally occur late.</p><p>In addition to point mutations, other genetic changes that are implicated in human tumorigenesis include altered DNA methylation, and gene rearrangements, amplifications, overexpression, and deletions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Serrated polyp pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of CRCs are believed to progress through an adenoma-carcinoma sequence. However, recent evidence increasingly supports the existence of an alternative route for colorectal carcinogenesis through serrated polyps, a group that encompasses a morphological spectrum, including hyperplastic polyps, mixed hyperplastic <span class=\"nowrap\">polyp/adenoma,</span> and serrated adenomas. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hypermethylation phenotype (CIMP+) pathway'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-polyps#H957226161\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon polyps&quot;, section on 'Sessile serrated polyps and traditional serrated adenomas'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular pathways to colorectal tumorigenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There appear to be at least three molecular pathways leading to colorectal tumorigenesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72239 \">table 1</a>): the chromosomal instability (CIN) pathway, which is typified by the inherited condition FAP; the <span class=\"nowrap\">mutator-phenotype/DNA</span> mismatch repair pathway, which is implicated in the inherited condition Lynch syndrome as well as in a proportion of sporadic CRCs in which there is loss of DNA mismatch repair protein function; and the hypermethylation phenotype <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperplastic/serrated</span> polyp pathway, which is characterized by a high frequency of methylation of some CpG islands (CpG island hypermethylation phenotype [CIMP]-positive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">The chromosomal instability (APC) pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CIN results from &quot;gain of function&quot; mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These may result either in activation of growth promoting pathways including oncogenes or diminished activity of tumor suppressor genes or apoptotic pathways.</p><p>These tumors may be inherited (as with FAP) or sporadic, and they are characterized by gross chromosomal abnormalities including deletions, insertions, and loss of heterozygosity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">The mutator phenotype/mismatch repair pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another pathway leading from adenomatous polyps, and probably from serrated adenomas, to invasive cancer has also been described, the mismatch repair pathway. This pathway is involved in CRCs arising in association with the inherited condition Lynch syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H345552210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>The key element of this pathway is dysfunction of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) enzymes, resulting from germline mutations in one of several different DNA mismatch repair genes, most commonly MLH1 or MSH2. Cells with deficient DNA repair capacity due to silencing of MMR genes accumulate DNA errors throughout the genome. The biologic &quot;footprint&quot; is the accumulation of abnormalities in short sequences of nucleotide bases that are repeated dozens to hundreds of times within the genome; these are called microsatellites, and the tumors are described as having the phenotype of high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H).</p><p>Besides being the biologic hallmark of Lynch syndrome, high levels of MSI are also found in approximately 15 percent of sporadic CRCs. However, in most of these cases, gene silencing is not due to a specific MMR mutation, but to an epigenetic phenomenon, hypermethylation of the gene promoter for the MMR enzyme (usually MLH1), which leads to transcriptional silencing of gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

CRCs that have a particularly high frequency of methylation of some CpG islands (in which a cytosine [C] base is followed immediately by a guanine [G] base that are linked with a phosphodiester bond [CpG]) are referred to as CIMP+ tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The defect may result in hypermethylation of the promoter region of MMR enzymes such as MLH1 and silencing of gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Activating mutations in the <em>BRAF</em> gene (most of which are in the V600E codon) occur almost exclusively in MSI-H, CIMP+ CRCs that do not carry mutations in <em>KRAS</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

This discussion is meant as an overview of the molecular pathogenesis of CRC rather than an exhaustive survey, which can be found elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Oncogenes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oncogenes are homologs of normal cellular genes that participate in cell growth pathways and cell cycle regulation. A mutational change in an oncogene leads to constitutive activation of the gene, which then results in uncontrolled cellular proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Because the normal gene function is activated, these are referred to as gain of function mutations.</p><p>Among the oncogenes implicated in sporadic CRC are <em>RAS</em>, <em>SRC</em>, <em>MYC</em>, and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (<em>HER2</em>; previously called <span class=\"nowrap\">HER2/neu</span> or ERBB-2); the most important is <em>RAS</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60613\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60613 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">RAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>RAS</em> oncogene exists as three cellular variants, <em>HRAS</em>, <em>KRAS</em>, and <em>NRAS</em>. Although all three oncogenes, when mutated, have the ability to transform normal cells, <em>KRAS</em> is the most frequently mutated in human CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The importance of <em>RAS</em> to colorectal tumorigenesis is underscored by the finding that CRC cells in which a mutated <em>RAS</em> gene has been removed or replaced lose their ability to form tumors in nude mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The <em>RAS</em> oncogenes encode a family of small proteins with homology to G-proteins that regulate cellular signal transduction by acting as a one-way switch for the transmission of extracellular growth signals to the nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These proteins normally cycle between an inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound state and an active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state. <em>RAS</em> mutations, typically point mutations, leave the protein resistant to GTP hydrolysis by GTPase, resulting in a constitutively active GTP-bound protein and a continuous growth stimulus. Data from animal models suggest that <em>RAS</em> mutations may contribute to colorectal tumorigenesis by activating cancer stem cells that have already been activated by adenomatous polyposis coli (<em>APC</em>) mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p><em>RAS</em> mutations are found in up to 50 percent of sporadic CRCs and 50 percent of colonic adenomas larger than 1 cm; they are rarely seen in smaller adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33</a>].

However, <em>RAS </em>mutations are not limited to dysplastic colonic lesions. Up to 100 percent of nondysplastic aberrant crypt foci (ACF, believed to be the first intermediate between normal colonic mucosa and the adenomatous polyp) and 25 percent of hyperplastic polyps have <em>RAS</em> mutations, but their significance is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27,30,31,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30,31,39</a>].</p><p>The identification of <em>RAS</em> mutations in CRC is of potential clinical relevance for both screening and therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The detection of <em>RAS</em> mutations in fecal material is a potentially sensitive screening method for the early diagnosis of CRC.

Affected individuals are at risk for multifocal and bilateral tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, in the nonhereditary form of RB, both allelic mutations arise spontaneously in a single retinal cell (ie, both are somatic mutations). The resulting phenotype is that of a unifocal, unilateral tumor that presents at a later age than the inherited variant and without heritable transmission to later offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p>The first molecular evidence for the involvement of tumor suppressor genes in CRC came from the study of allelic loss, in which large chromosomal deletions were detected using polymorphic markers that distinguish the two alleles present in the germline. When comparing tumor alleles with those present in normal tissue, deletions were identified as &quot;loss of heterozygosity&quot; (LOH).</p><p>In early studies of CRC, LOH for chromosomes 5q, 8p, 17p, or 18q was detected in 36, 50, 73, and 75 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/33,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,43</a>]. Presumptive tumor suppressor genes were subsequently identified on 5q (the location of the <em>APC </em>gene), 18q (the location of the deleted in colon cancer [<em>DCC</em>] gene, and the <em>SMAD4</em> and <em>SMAD2</em> genes), and 17p (location of the <em>TP53 </em>gene).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">APC gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perhaps the most critical gene in the early development of CRC is the <em>APC</em> gene. Somatic mutations in both alleles are present in 80 percent of sporadic CRCs, and a single germline mutation in this gene is responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a dominantly inherited syndrome characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of colorectal polyps by the second or third decade of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-adenomatous-polyposis#H547090028\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>A germline <em>APC</em> mutation is also thought to contribute to the development of familial CRC in Ashkenazi Jews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,44,45</a>]. A thymine to adenine transversion at nucleotide 3920 in the <em>APC</em> gene that resulted in a substitution of lysine for isoleucine at codon 1307 (I1307K) is found in 6 percent of all persons of Ashkenazi Jewish descent but in a higher frequency of Ashkenazi Jews with both a personal and family history of CRC (28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This mutation was previously thought to represent a polymorphism.</p><p>The recognition of the importance of the <em>APC</em> gene began with genetic studies linking inheritance of the FAP syndrome to chromosome 5q21 and the subsequent identification of germline mutations involving a gene at this locus, the <em>APC</em> gene. The earliest malignant lesions in these patients, dysplastic aberrant crypt foci (microadenomas) and small adenomatous polyps, have lost the second <em>APC</em> allele (through deletion or somatic mutation), suggesting that loss of <em>APC </em>expression is a very early event in CRC tumorigenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>The function of the <em>APC</em> gene product and the mechanism whereby the abnormal gene promotes tumor formation are beginning to be understood. An important clue was the observation that most sporadic CRCs with normal or wild-type <em>APC</em> had mutations in the <em>CTNNB1</em> gene, which encodes beta-catenin, a protein involved in the same signaling cascade as the <em>APC</em> gene product, the Wnt (Wingless-type) signaling pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. It is now hypothesized that most sporadic CRCs are initiated by activating Wnt pathway mutations, characterized by the stabilization of beta-catenin and constitutive transcription by a <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-catenin/T-cell</span> factor (Tcf)-4 complex.</p><p>The Wnt pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway that is necessary for embryonic development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. It also plays a central role in supporting intestinal epithelial renewal, an important fact since CRC is thought to originate in the expansion of colonic crypt cells.</p><p>The basic features of the Wnt signaling pathway are depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72022\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72022 \">figure 4</a>). The normal APC protein appears to prevent the accumulation of cytosolic and nuclear beta-catenin by mediating its phosphorylation and resultant degradation. The majority of mutations in the <em>APC</em> gene (both germline and somatic) lead to premature truncation of the APC protein and loss of its beta-catenin regulatory domains. Loss of functional APC (as well as mutations in the beta-catenin gene) results in the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, which binds and activates the transcription factor Tcf-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>].</p><p>It is proposed that <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-catenin/Tcf-4</span> acts as a switch controlling proliferation versus differentiation in the intestinal crypt epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Activation of this pathway prevents the cells from either entering G1 arrest or undergoing terminal differentiation and induces resistance to apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The end result is cellular proliferation. In addition, because several other cell signaling pathways converge with the Wnt pathway, it represents a &quot;final common pathway&quot; through which multiple abnormalities affecting other cellular signaling pathways may result in the same carcinogenic result.</p><p>In addition to the typical loss of function tumor suppression mechanism of carcinogenesis, more recent evidence suggests that C-terminally truncated <em>APC</em> may also have gain of function properties; this mechanism of carcinogenesis promotion is typically attributed to oncogenes and not tumor suppressor genes. Studies have reported that a truncated <em>APC</em> gene promotes cell survival through regulation of the <em>BCL2</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>], stimulates cell migration through mediation of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor termed Asef [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], and activates proliferation of human colonic epithelial cells in culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p>Other mechanisms may also contribute to the tumorigenic potential of <em>APC</em> mutations. Mutations in <em>APC</em> (but not <em>CTNNB1</em>) are associated with chromosomal instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], predisposing the cell to &quot;hits&quot; in other genes that may contribute to tumor progression and malignant transformation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">TP53 gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>TP53</em> gene on chromosome 17p is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. In approximately 50 to 70 percent of CRCs, <em>TP53</em> inactivation occurs by a mutation of one allele followed by loss of the remaining wild type gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/33,64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,64-67</a>]. 17p sequences are lost in as many as 75 percent of CRCs, while they are rarely lost in adenomas and aberrant crypt foci, suggesting that loss of p53 function represents a relatively late event in colorectal tumorigenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4,33,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,33,68</a>]. In keeping with this hypothesis, a large international study of 3583 CRCs found an increase in the frequency of <em>TP53</em> mutations with advancing disease stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>The normal &quot;wild-type&quot; <em>TP53</em> gene produces a DNA-binding protein p53 that acts as a transcriptional activator of growth inhibitory genes. Wild-type p53 may be particularly critical when cells are under stress. Normally, cells arrest their growth in response to DNA damaging agents and other stressors (eg, hypoxia) via <span class=\"nowrap\">induction/activation</span> of p53 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. Once activated, p53 induces a variety of growth-limiting responses, including cell cycle arrest (in order to facilitate DNA repair), apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation. p53 produces these responses largely by altering the expression of a number of target genes, at least 20 of which have been described as being under transcriptional control of p53. Because of its central role in preventing the propagation of cells with DNA damage, p53 has been referred to as the &quot;guardian of the genome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Although inactivation of the p53 pathway appears to be a late event in the majority of human CRCs, it may represent an earlier event in inflammatory bowel disease-related CRC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-and-management-of-dysplasia-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Molecular pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Given the association of p53 pathway inactivation with CRC, it is unclear why patients with the Li Fraumeni syndrome (a condition caused by a germline mutation in <em>TP53</em> in which patients frequently develop carcinomas, sarcomas, and leukemias) are not at particularly increased risk of developing CRCs. However, germline <em>TP53</em> mutations may be associated with early onset CRC. In a report derived from the population- and clinic-based Colon Cancer Family Registry, germline <em>TP53</em> mutations were identified in 6 of 457 individuals (1.3 percent) diagnosed with CRC at age 40 or younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. This frequency is roughly comparable to the prevalence of germline <em>APC</em> mutations in CRC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=li-fraumeni-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The identification of <em>TP53</em> mutations in an individual CRC is of potential clinical significance, prognostically and therapeutically. In many but not all studies, patients whose tumors harbor <em>TP53</em> mutations have worse outcomes and shorter survival than those without such mutations. At least some of the discordant results may be due to the fact that the prognostic influence of <em>TP53</em> abnormalities appears to depend on tumor site, type of mutation, and the use of adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

In 1989, a candidate gene termed the &quot;deleted in colorectal carcinoma&quot; (<em>DCC</em>) gene was identified at 18q21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], and point mutations in the <em>DCC</em> gene have been identified in CRCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>].</p><p>Gene mutations presumably lead to a loss of expression of the DCC protein, which is thought to have a role in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/77,80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,80,81</a>]. DCC is normally expressed in many tissues, including the colonic mucosa, although its normal function has been difficult to elucidate because of its large size and the lack of expression in CRCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>Loss of DCC expression may have prognostic value, particularly in patients with early stage CRC.

TGF-beta suppresses the growth of most normal cells by binding to type I (TGFBR1) and type II (TGFBR2) transmembrane receptors, but many cancer cells are resistant to this growth-suppressive effect. In CRC cells, SMAD4 is required for TGF-beta signaling, and at least in vitro, reintroduction of the gene (via transfection of an intact chromosome 18) is associated with restoration of TGF-beta sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>].</p><p>Mutations in <em>SMAD4</em> or a third putative tumor suppressor gene that also maps to 18q (<em>SMAD2</em>) have been found in a subset of sporadic CRCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/62,86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,86-88</a>].

A multistep process of specific genetic changes is thought to drive the transformation from normal colonic epithelium to an invasive cancer. Single, specific germline mutations underlie the common inherited syndromes (eg, adenomatous polyposis coli [<em>APC</em>], Lynch syndrome), while sporadic cancers result from the stepwise accumulation of multiple somatic mutations. Mutations in the <em>APC</em> gene occur early, while others, such as mutations of the <em>TP53</em> suppressor gene, generally occur late in the process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55601 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis of CRC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The concept of microsatellite instability (MSI) provides an additional layer of complexity to this model. The MSI-high (MSI-H) phenotype is associated with Lynch syndrome and is also observed in approximately 10 to 15 percent of sporadic CRCs. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'The mutator phenotype/mismatch repair pathway'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The available data suggest that most colorectal neoplasias begin with inactivation (through a germline or sporadic mutation) of the <em>APC</em> gene, whether or not MSI is present. However, the genetic events may thereafter diverge, depending upon the mechanism underlying genetic instability (ie, chromosomal instability, germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair [MMR] enzymes, CpG island hypermethylation phenotype [CIMP+]). This has led to the molecular classification of CRC into three carcinogenic pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72239 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathways to colorectal tumorigenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compared with patients with chromosomal instability (which includes those with familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP] and the majority of sporadic CRCs), the MSI-H or &quot;mutator&quot; pathway involves a unique destabilizing mechanism and inactivation of a different set of genes (which encode the DNA MMR proteins). The CIMP+ pathway involves hypermethylation of the gene promoter for a DNA MMR gene. Regardless of the molecular pathway involved, the final result is the same.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to providing insight as to the biology of all CRCs, the identification of specific genetic mutations responsible for colorectal tumorigenesis has had a direct influence on clinical care. Patients at highest risk for developing CRC can be identified via genetic testing for specific germline mutations. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Tumor suppressor genes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Mismatch repair genes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'MUTYH defects and familial CRC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Furthermore, new molecular screening methods for early detection of CRC by detection of mutations in fecal material are under study. In addition, these mutations are also being examined as prognostic markers and as potential therapeutic targets.
