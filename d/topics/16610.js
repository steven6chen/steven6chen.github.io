(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Intraoperative hemodilution&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interest in all forms of autologous transfusion, particularly PAD, mushroomed in response to the AIDS epidemic, beginning as early as 1983. By 1993, when participation in PAD peaked, approximately 6 percent of all blood collected in the United States was intended for autologous use. This percentage subsequently declined to less than 1 percent of blood collections. A variety of factors may have contributed to the decline in PAD, including a realization that a large portion of autologous blood was not administered (and therefore wasted) and increasing confidence in the safety of the blood supply. Increasing interest and participation in patient blood management programs has led to downward pressure on blood transfusion in all forms, including autologous transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Procedures and processes to enhance safety for the blood recipient and the blood donor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most obvious benefit of PAD for the <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/patient</span> is freedom from concern about infectivity of the blood. Assuming that the donor is not bacteremic at the time of donation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there are no clerical errors resulting in the inadvertent transfusion of the wrong unit of blood, the patient is also protected against hemolytic, febrile, or allergic transfusion reactions; alloimmunization to erythrocyte, leukocyte, platelet, or protein antigens; and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An additional benefit (more theoretical than practical) is that erythropoiesis may be stimulated by repeated phlebotomies, thereby enabling the patient to regenerate hemoglobin at an accelerated rate after surgery.</p><p>The overall efficacy of PAD has been evaluated in both randomized trials and cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A meta-analysis found that patients who underwent PAD were much less likely than controls to receive allogeneic blood (odds ratio 0.17) but were more likely to undergo any transfusion with autologous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> allogeneic blood (odds ratio 3.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The latter effect is due both to a lower hematocrit in patients undergoing PAD and a more liberal transfusion policy when using autologous blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DRAWBACKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PAD programs are not without some drawbacks. Perhaps the most important is that autologous blood is considerably more expensive than allogeneic blood. This problem is compounded by the fact that current reimbursement programs (including Medicare) either deny the medical necessity of PAD or ignore the well-documented increase in cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The basis for the higher cost includes the extra time and attention required by autologous <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/patients;</span> the enhanced clerical requirements; the special handling (additional labels, separate storage, early delivery to the hospital, etc); and the fact that blood that is not transfused to the intended recipient (approximately 50 percent of donated blood) is wasted rather than transfused to other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>There is also the potential, as with any transfusion, both for undetectable bacterial growth during liquid storage, and for clerical error, resulting in the <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/patient</span> receiving allogeneic blood rather than the predonated autologous units.</p><p>These concerns take on added significance in light of a study demonstrating that, for patients undergoing elective hysterectomy, PAD was an independent risk factor for requiring a transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Transfusions were given to 25 of 140 women who had undergone PAD versus only 1 of 123 who had not. Similar results were obtained in a prospective randomized trial in patients scheduled to undergo hip replacement surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Both a higher incidence of anemia due to preoperative blood donation and a more liberal transfusion policy when autologous blood was available are thought to be responsible for this difference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011533\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the late 1980s, when concern about infection risk was at its peak, virtually all patients contemplating surgery who had even a remote necessity for blood transfusion chose to participate in a PAD program. As a result of this overutilization, actual usage of predonated units by autologous <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/patients</span> declined to between 40 and 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>This has led to the generation of guidelines to increase the efficiency of PAD. Appropriate candidates for PAD include patients with the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are in relatively good health</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can tolerate iron replenishment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are about to undergo a surgical procedure during which the likelihood of blood loss in excess of 500 to 1000 mL is equal to or greater than 5 to 10 percent</p><p/><p>Another approach for the last criterion is to encourage PAD for any patient scheduled for elective surgery for whom crossmatched blood is recommended by the local hospital maximum blood order schedule.</p><p>The number of units to be predonated depends upon the anticipated blood loss, an amount that varies, even for the same procedure, among surgical teams in different hospitals. It is therefore difficult to make general recommendations regarding the number of units to collect for specific procedures. A method has been proposed to estimate, in a given hospital, the approximate number of autologous units to draw for any procedure in order to prevent the need for allogeneic blood in any given percentage of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This method is called SOPCAB, an acronym for &quot;schedule of optimal preoperative collection of autologous blood.&quot;</p><p>SOPCAB, although not widely utilized, is a reasonable first step. One simply calculates, for a given procedure, how much blood would have had to have been predonated in order to satisfy the complete blood needs of 75 percent of patients. That number then becomes the standard order unless there are special circumstances that dictate any changes. The major drawback to this approach is that a great deal of extra blood is drawn and ultimately wasted in order to satisfy the transfusion needs of a large percentage of patients.</p><p>Virtually any patient deemed medically able to tolerate a surgical procedure involving general anesthesia should also be able to tolerate the withdrawal of one unit of blood (500 mL or proportionately less if the donor weighs under 50 kg [110 lb]). Factors strictly defined for allogeneic donors, including age, weight, sex, and hemoglobin level, are evaluated with greater flexibility for the autologous donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Several studies have documented the ability of even higher risk <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/patients</span> to tolerate the donation process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, one report detected a substantial number of adverse hemodynamic changes (systolic and diastolic hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias and ST-T wave changes) not recognized by conventional clinical observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exclusions from PAD include patients with any of the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable angina or angina at rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A myocardial infarction within the last three months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic stenosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular arrhythmias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient ischemic attacks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked hypertension</p><p/><p>PAD is also contraindicated in patients with an active infection, particularly if it could be associated with bacteremia. Although most bacteria will not proliferate in the cold, some psychrophilic organisms (such as Yersinia enterocolitica) can reach peak concentrations in blood within one or two weeks of storage at 4&deg;C. Transfusion of this blood after prolonged cold storage has been associated with fatal reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>It may also be prudent to discourage PAD in patients over the age of 80. These patients are at minimal risk from conventional transfusions given the current safety of allogeneic blood, and the long latent period before symptoms attributable to a transfusion-transmitted infection typically develop may exceed their life expectancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGRAM SPECIFICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following is a brief review of the sequential steps involved in a PAD program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physician request</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are accepted into PAD programs at the request of their clinician, usually the surgeon or anesthesiologist who will perform the surgery. This clinician, or a colleague with credentials in family practice, internal medicine, or cardiology, must certify that the phlebotomies pose no undue risk to the patient. The final decision regarding acceptability rests with the medical director of the blood collection facility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should begin oral iron supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> (or comparable preparation), 300 mg three times per day, if tolerated, as soon as surgery is scheduled. It is preferable to begin this regimen days to weeks before the first phlebotomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Scheduling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most practical schedule for obtaining more than one unit of autologous blood is to draw units at weekly intervals, with the last unit drawn at least two weeks, although no fewer than 72 hours, prior to surgery. More intensive donating schedules are possible, but rarely required. Although a last donation 72 hours prior to surgery allows for the volume and protein losses to be replaced, we do not recommend this regimen, since there is no useful purpose served by drawing blood when there is insufficient time for the red blood cells to be replenished.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient considering preoperative autologous donation should not only have an understanding of the risks and benefits of autologous donation and transfusion, but should also be made aware of transfusion alternatives, such as allogeneic blood transfusion and intraoperative cell recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Autologous donors should sign an informed consent form prior to donation. This form should outline the advantages, nature, and purposes of autologous transfusion; the risks involved; and the possibility of complications. Permission should also be obtained to share laboratory results with the patient's clinician, if indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Donors/patients</span> of all ages and weights can participate in PAD programs. For donors weighing less than 50 kg, proportionately less blood constitutes one unit as estimated from the following formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Amount to draw &#160; = &#160; 500 mL &#160;x &#160;(weight [kg] &#160;&divide; &#160;50)</p></div></div><p>The amount of anticoagulant to leave in the primary container (normally 95 to 102 mL for a full unit) can then be calculated from:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Amount of anticoagulant &#160; = &#160; 95 mL &#160;x &#160;(amount to draw &#160;&divide; &#160;500)</p></div></div><p>Blood should only be drawn if the donor's hemoglobin level is at least 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or the hematocrit is at least 33 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Labeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predonated autologous blood must be labeled to reflect all testing that has been done. In addition, a special autologous tag should be attached to the unit. This tag should contain the patient's name, a unique identifying number (eg, social security or hospital registration number), the ABO and Rh group, and the date of expiration of the unit. If incompletely tested or otherwise unsuitable for allogeneic use, the tag must also bear the statement &quot;for autologous use only &mdash; may not be issued to another patient&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pretransfusion compatibility testing can be abbreviated for the autologous <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/patient</span>. Nevertheless, it is good practice to perform an ABO, Rh, and antibody screen on a patient specimen; a confirmation ABO on the autologous unit; and, as a precaution against a clerical or labeling error, an immediate spin crossmatch prior to issuing the unit for transfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TRANSFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion of autologous blood is not free of potential toxicity, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemolysis secondary to improper handling of the saved units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis resulting from bacterial contamination of the saved units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary edema induced by volume overload (TACO) or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion of the wrong unit of blood due to misidentification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]</p><p/><p>These potential complications make it imperative that autologous blood be transfused wisely and only when specifically indicated. It is never reasonable to transfuse an autologous unit simply because it is available or would otherwise be discarded. Similarly, autologous blood should not be transfused to replace iron, to promote wound healing or general well-being, or to normalize the hemoglobin level. On the other hand, the relative safety of autologous transfusion may permit relaxation of the transfusion &quot;trigger&quot; (eg, by transfusing a postpartum patient with a hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> rather than &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25010862\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTROVERSIAL AREAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several aspects of the provision of PAD services remain controversial despite much experience and the apparent benefit of protecting the patient from infection. These include: extent of testing; release of infectious units; participation by known infectious donors; crossover (the release of blood not used by the autologous donor to other recipients); the use of erythropoietin; and cost-effectiveness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25010896\"><span class=\"h2\">Extent of testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autologous blood that will be made available for crossover must be subjected to all tests performed on allogeneic donor blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;, section on 'Infectious disease screening'</a>.)</p><p>Autologous blood that will not be made available for crossover, but will be shipped for transfusion from the collecting to the transfusing facility, must be tested for syphilis, hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and West Nile virus (WNV). Autologous blood that will be transfused within the same institution in which it is drawn need not undergo any infectious disease testing. The extent to which autologous blood (particularly in this latter category) is tested is clearly discretionary. It is, therefore, a continuing source of controversy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25010902\"><span class=\"h3\">Arguments in favor of minimal or no testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These include: a decrease in processing costs; avoidance of the need to obtain a federal license to operate a blood collecting and processing facility; simplified bookkeeping (since nontested autologous blood cannot be crossed-over to another recipient); and avoidance of the awkward and sometimes confusing problems created by testing and the subsequent finding of abnormal laboratory test results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25010908\"><span class=\"h3\">Arguments in favor of complete testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These include: administrative simplicity (the chance for error is magnified whenever all collected blood is not handled in the same manner); shipping of partially tested units represents a significant administrative burden, since they must be packaged and shipped as though potentially infectious; complete testing allows for the possibility of crossover (somewhat moot, since less than 2 percent of autologous blood, if any, is actually made available for crossover); and, most important, complete testing enables the collecting facility to make appropriate decisions about the disposition of potentially infectious units (see below). It is this last argument that convinces the author that complete infectious disease testing of autologous blood is the best policy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25010914\"><span class=\"h2\">Release of infected units</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuing controversy surrounds the handling of autologous blood that tests positive for one or more infectious disease marker, particularly HBV, HCV, HIV, WNV, Zika, or Chagas; the other markers are considered less significant. There are no guidelines from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) that address this issue. Thus, the decision as to whether or not to release test-positive blood back to the <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/patient</span> is made at the institutional level. However, both the FDA and AABB require a written statement from the receiving transfusion service and the attending physician that HIV or HBV confirmed reactive units are acceptable in order for them to be shipped from the collecting to a transfusing facility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011004\"><span class=\"h3\">Rationale for releasing infected units</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for releasing autologous, test-positive blood is to protect <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/patients</span> from the adverse consequences of allogeneic blood exposure, regardless of their own infectious disease status. Support for this argument is provided by a report that allogeneic mononuclear cells may have a deleterious effect on HIV-infected patients, although this conclusion has been challenged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011010\"><span class=\"h3\">Rationale for not releasing infected units</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for not releasing potentially infectious blood is to protect health care workers and to prevent transmission of an infectious disease to another patient should the known infectious unit be inadvertently transfused to the wrong patient. While both of these concerns are preventable to some extent, they are also unavoidable.</p><p>Studies in San Francisco, for example, showed that 1.7 percent of all operations were associated with accidents involving parenteral exposure to blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Similarly, in response to a 1992 College of American Pathologists survey, 0.9 percent of laboratories admitted issuing an autologous unit of whole blood or red blood cells for the wrong patient; on 20 occasions, the unit was actually transfused to the wrong patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Such data, few as there are, support the position (endorsed by the author) of not releasing potentially infectious blood for transfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011016\"><span class=\"h3\">Participation by known infectious donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The opposing viewpoints in this controversial area are virtually identical to those in the previous one. Arguments in favor of allowing known infected patients to participate in PAD programs were articulated in a report that, after considering civil rights issues, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and safety issues, concluded that patients infected with HIV must be permitted to provide and receive autologous blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Some of the complex medical, ethical, and legal issues raised in this editorial were further addressed by the autologous transfusion committee of the AABB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In contrast, others have used decision analysis to calculate the anticipated benefits of providing known infected patients with the opportunity to participate in PAD programs versus the risks to them of having to receive allogeneic blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The benefits attained by these known infected patients were compared with the adverse consequences potentially experienced (a calculable number) by other patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> health care workers inadvertently exposed to the infected blood from the autologous <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/donor</span>. The conclusion was that, given the safety of allogeneic blood, the benefit to be derived by providing patients infected with HIV, HBV, or HCV with autologous blood is very small, particularly when compared with the potential harm to healthcare workers (and other patients) should known infectious blood be allowed into the system. These findings lend support to our strongly held conviction that known infectious patients should not be allowed to participate in PAD programs.</p><p>Despite the author's continuing strong opinion regarding release of infectious units and participation by known infectious donors, a caveat must be included. As outlined in Association Bulletin #98-5 of the AABB, dated September 18, 1998, The Supreme Court decision in Bragdon v. Abbott [Bragdon v. Abbott, 118 S. Ct. 2196 (1998)] specifically provides protection to HIV infected individuals under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). AABB, the American Red Cross, and the Department of Defense have interpreted (and extended) this decision to HIV infected individuals wishing to participate in autologous transfusion programs, and suggest that to deny participation may run counter to the intent of the Bragdon decision. Given the issues of safety to others raised above, it is possible that the Bragdon decision may not apply to participation in autologous transfusion programs. However, the question has not specifically been addressed, and the reader is cautioned to consult with legal counsel before adopting a policy that denies either participation by known infectious donors or release of known infected blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011227\"><span class=\"h2\">Crossover (release to other recipients)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When PAD programs first gained popularity, most programs allowed unused autologous blood that met all criteria applied to allogeneic blood (including medical history screening and laboratory testing) to be crossed-over (ie, made available) to recipients other than the autologous <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/donor</span>. As late as 1987, crossover was allowed in 65 percent of PAD programs; by 1990, however, only 2 percent of programs continued this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While proponents argue that crossover would increase the total available blood supply and possibly reduce the overall cost of autologous blood programs, these considerations have been outweighed by concerns about the safety of autologous blood and the seemingly insurmountable logistic barriers to accurate administration of a crossover program. At present, the author doubts that crossover is allowed by any US collection agency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011233\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Safety issues with respect to autologous blood include concerns about the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/donor's</span> understanding of the nature of his or her illness (possibly precluding an accurate medical history); unresolved questions about the impact on safety that the patient's motivation (as contrasted with the community donor's presumed altruistic motivation) might have; and, finally, infectious disease test data, indicating a much higher frequency of viral markers in autologous as compared with volunteer donors. In study, for example, the following risk ratios for autologous versus volunteer donors were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3.1 for HBsAg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3.6 for anti-HBc</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4.2 for anti-HIV-1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1.3 for elevated ALT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5.7 for RPR</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011239\"><span class=\"h3\">Logistical problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Logistical problems include the reluctance of many surgeons to release autologous blood until so late in its dating period that it is difficult to guarantee its use for another patient; the necessity to make a separate determination for each unit donated as to its eligibility for crossover; and the increase in complexity of record keeping and billing for a relatively small return in terms of the number of units added to the system. For the above reasons, the author feels that crossover of autologous blood is inappropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011245\"><span class=\"h3\">Cost issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crossover is also not a solution to the ever increasing cost of PAD programs. To the contrary, it was long ago argued that resources could actually be saved if what little crossover is done were eliminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The most appropriate response to the increase in wastage that has accompanied the rise in participation in PAD programs is to minimize overcollection by educating physicians and patients concerning appropriate donation policies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011251\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of erythropoietin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite much excitement about the potential value of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-huEPO) in the perioperative setting, there appears to be only a limited role for r-huEPO as an adjunct to more conventional blood conservation techniques. Its routine use in autologous donors seems to be unjustified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. r-huEPO is primarily indicated in those patients in a PAD program who are anemic prior to the first donation or who have small blood volumes and would otherwise be unable to meet their anticipated needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The dose has ranged from 12,000 to 40,000 units per week (given subcutaneously) and iron replacement is given concurrently (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> or its equivalent at a dose of 325 mg orally three times per day, if tolerated). R-huEPO can also be used to correct anemia preoperatively in selected patients who, for religious reasons, for example, refuse both allogeneic and autologous blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The approach to the patient who refuses blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25011257\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost-effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have been performed using the decision-analysis model in an attempt to assess the cost-effectiveness of various medical interventions. These models evaluated costs and all potential outcomes, comparing participants in the intervention (such as PAD) with nonparticipants, and expressed cost-effectiveness in dollars per quality-adjusted year of life saved (QALY). Given the increasing safety of allogeneic blood and the tremendous wastage of autologous blood, it is no surprise that PAD is not cost-effective. What is surprising is the magnitude of the cost-<strong>in</strong>effectiveness. Depending upon the age of the patient and the likelihood that blood would be transfused, the cost-effectiveness of autologous transfusion ranges from $235,000 to over $23 million per QALY saved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In actuality, substituting autologous for allogeneic blood results in little expected health benefit, 0.0002 to 0.00044 QALY (1.8 to 3.8 hours) saved per unit, at an additional cost per unit of $68 to $4783.</p><p>It is clear that however one chooses to define the upper limit of cost-effective medical care (eg, $50,000, $100,000), this level is almost always exceeded by the cost of PAD. Some have suggested that there are other, intangible factors that justify this huge expense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This issue, whether society will be willing to continue to expend scarce resources on autologous donation while more cost effective practices are not universally available, will need to be addressed by public policy makers. At present, the best that the clinician can do is to decrease inappropriate utilization of PAD in circumstances where the likelihood of a transfusion being required is remote [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Interest in all forms of autologous transfusion, particularly PAD, mushroomed in response to the AIDS epidemic, and has substantially diminished now that the safety of blood products has improved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Intraoperative hemodilution&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benefits</strong> &ndash; Assuming that the donor is not bacteremic at the time of donation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there are no clerical errors resulting in the inadvertent transfusion of the wrong unit of blood, the patient is protected against hemolytic, febrile or allergic transfusion reactions; alloimmunization to erythrocyte, leukocyte, platelet, or protein antigens; and graft-versus-host disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Benefits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drawbacks</strong> &ndash; PAD has several drawbacks compared with the use of allogeneic transfusion, including the greater expense of autologous blood; the potential for complications such as infection and hemolysis; and the greater likelihood that transfusion will be used due to anemia induced by the donation and the availability of the autologous unit(s). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Drawbacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications</strong> &ndash; We believe that PAD programs currently have marginal value and cost effectiveness. PAD should be restricted to healthy individuals with long life expectancies requiring blood-intensive procedures, or to individuals for whom crossmatch-compatible blood is unavailable (a rare occurrence). Appropriate candidates for PAD are those who are in relatively good health, can tolerate iron replenishment, and have at least a 5 to 10 percent likelihood of blood loss in excess of 500 to 1000 mL. (See <a href=\"#H25011533\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> &ndash; Exclusions from PAD include cardiovascular factors that would increase the risks associated with phlebotomy (eg, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, heart failure, aortic stenosis unstable angina, angina at rest, myocardial infarction within the last three months, heart failure, aortic stenosis, transient ischemic attacks). PAD is also contraindicated in patients with an active infection, particularly if it could be associated with bacteremia. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Controversies</strong> &ndash; Several aspects of the provision of PAD services remain controversial despite much experience and the apparent benefit of protecting the patient from infection. These include the extent of testing; release of infectious units; participation by known infectious donors; crossover (the release of blood not used by the autologous donor to other recipients); the use of erythropoietin; and cost effectiveness. (See <a href=\"#H25010862\" class=\"local\">'Controversial areas'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Vanderlinde ES, Heal JM, Blumberg N.
