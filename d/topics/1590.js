An elevated RBC can reflect polycythemia (reactive or neoplastic) or a disorder of globin synthesis. A decreased RBC typically reflects anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-polycythemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the patient with polycythemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin</strong> &ndash; Hemoglobin (Hgb) is the concentration of hemoglobin in whole blood, in <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/deciliter</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/dL)</span>. An increased Hgb may reflect a polycythemia (reactive or neoplastic) or be due to dehydration. A decreased Hgb typically reflects anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematocrit</strong> &ndash; The hematocrit (Hct) is the packed spun volume of blood made up of RBC, expressed as a percentage of total blood volume. It can be measured or calculated as Hct = (RBC x <span class=\"nowrap\">MCV)/10</span>. An increased hematocrit can reflect polycythemia (reactive or neoplastic); if calculated, an increased Hct may reflect a normal number of RBC with an elevated MCV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MCV</strong> &ndash; Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is the average volume (size) of the patient's RBCs. It can be measured or calculated as above (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above). Anemia can be classified based on whether the MCV is low, normal, or elevated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Morphologic approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MCH</strong> &ndash; Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is the average hemoglobin content in a RBC. It is calculated as MCH <span class=\"nowrap\">(pg/red</span> cell) = Hgb <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/dL)</span> x 10 &divide; RBC <span class=\"nowrap\">(millions/microL)</span>. A low MCH indicates decreased hemoglobin content per cell, and is typically reflected in hypochromia on the peripheral blood smear. This may be seen in iron deficiency and disorders of globin synthesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MCHC</strong> &ndash; Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is the average hemoglobin concentration per RBC, in <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/dL</span>. It is calculated as MCHC <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/dL)</span> = Hgb <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/dL)</span> X 100 &divide; Hct (percent). Low and high MCHC values are helpful in classifying anemias. Very low MCHC values are typical of iron deficiency anemia, and very high MCHC values typically reflect spherocytosis or RBC agglutination. Examination of the peripheral blood smear is helpful in distinguishing these findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Red blood cell indices'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-peripheral-blood-smear#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear&quot;, section on 'Red blood cells'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>RDW</strong> &ndash; Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of the variation in RBC size, which is reflected in the degree of anisocytosis on the peripheral blood smear. A high RDW implies a large variation in RBC sizes, and a low RDW implies a more homogeneous population of RBCs. RDW is calculated; the RDW is the coefficient of variation (CV) or the standard deviation (SD) of the red cell volume distribution curve. RDW is helpful in the classification of anemia. A very elevated RDW can be seen in iron deficiency, transfused anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and homozygous hemoglobinopathy, whereas slightly elevated RDWs can be seen in thalassemia trait and anemia of chronic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Morphologic approach'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-peripheral-blood-smear\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>WBC</strong> &ndash; The white blood cell (WBC) count is the number of WBC per microL of blood (or number of WBC x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span>. An elevated WBC (ie, leukocytosis) may be seen in neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions. If the WBC is elevated, enumeration of the WBC differential and review of the peripheral blood smear is used along with clinical evaluation to determine the cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with neutrophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the WBC is decreased (ie, leukopenia), a WBC differential should be obtained and the peripheral blood smear examined to enumerate which cell type is decreased. Since neutrophils make up the greatest percentage of WBCs, leukopenia is usually due to neutropenia at a minimum (and perhaps decreases in other WBCs as well). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenia in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PLT</strong> &ndash; The platelet count (PLT) is the number of platelets per microL of blood (or number of platelets x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span>. An elevated platelet count (ie, thrombocytosis, also called thrombocythemia) may be seen in reactive and neoplastic conditions. A decreased platelet count (ie, thrombocytopenia) may reflect platelet destruction, sequestration, or ineffective thrombopoiesis. Examination of the peripheral blood smear is helpful in distinguishing among possible causes.

Evaluation of the MPV should be done in context of the platelet count. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Platelet error flags'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Laboratory testing'</a> and <a href=\"#H9208095\" class=\"local\">'Approach to an abnormal MPV'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Normal values for RBC parameters are included in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64238\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64238 \">table 1</a>).

The use of EDTA may cause platelet clumping in some patients (ie, pseudothrombocytopenia).</p><p>It is recommended that blood samples be kept at room temperature if analysis is to occur within eight hours of collection. Samples should be refrigerated if the analysis is to occur up to 24 hours after collection. We do not recommend that samples more than 36 hours old be used for CBC testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THE COULTER IMPEDANCE APERTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1953, Wallace Coulter patented a device developed in their basement that used an electric impedance aperture to count red cells and white cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the impedance method, blood is diluted in a current-conducting solution, such as isotonic saline. The suspension of cells is drawn by a vacuum through a small aperture positioned between two sensing electrodes connected across a direct current potential. As each cell passes through the aperture, the resistance between the electrodes increases. The non-conductive cell being counted produces a momentary increase in impedance, resulting in an electrical pulse, with the number of pulses indicating the cell count, and the amplitude of the pulse being proportional to the cell's volume. Upper and lower pulse height thresholds could be selected such that only particles within a specific volume range would be counted.</p><p>Since typical red blood cell (RBC) counts are three orders of magnitude greater than white blood cell (WBC) counts, and since appropriate settings of the lower pulse height threshold eliminate counting of the smaller platelets (platelet volume is approximately 9 fL, or approximately one-tenth the volume of mature red cells), a cell count on appropriately diluted whole blood samples served to yield a RBC count. RBC lysing reagents then need to be added to the sample before the white blood cells can be counted with accuracy.</p><p>In the 1960s, the first multichannel automated hematology instruments appeared. Anticoagulated whole blood samples were aspirated into the apparatus and automatically aliquoted and diluted into RBC and WBC counting chambers (baths) for cell counting and sizing with impedance apertures, and into a spectrophotometric cuvette for Hgb determination using the cyanmethemoglobin method. Coincidence correction (to correct for when two or more cells passing through the aperture are counted as one cell) and calculations of RBC indices were automatically performed.</p><p>Since these machines measure the RBC count directly, as well as the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), the hematocrit (Hct) could be electronically calculated by rearranging one of the original Wintrobe formulae shown above:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Hct (percent) = RBC (in <span class=\"nowrap\">millions/microL)</span> x MCV (fL) &divide; 10</p></div></div><p>These first multichannel instruments revolutionized the complete blood count (CBC) as a laboratory test, enabling high throughput, low cost, and fast turnaround time with the ability to produce immediate (STAT) results. However, the platelet count was not a part of the first automated CBC, since the aperture resolution on the early instruments could not adequately separate platelets from RBCs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">The red blood cell volume histogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modern cell counting and sizing apertures have sufficient precision to function as &quot;channelizers.&quot; As an example, Coulter instruments channel cells within the <span class=\"nowrap\">RBC/platelet</span> aperture into 256 bins in the size range from zero to 360 fL. RBCs are not only enumerated as those particles with a cell volume within the range of 36 to 360 fL, but they are also classified into appropriate &quot;channels&quot; by size (related to the pulse height). For instruments with pulse editing circuitry, aberrant pulses are excluded from these channels. A plot of frequency versus channel size allows the development of a RBC volume histogram, which can be smoothed into a RBC size distribution curve.</p><p>The RBC size frequency distribution curve typically has a symmetrical or Gaussian shape. The MCV and red cell distribution width (RDW, the coefficient of variation of the RBC volume distribution) are directly derived from this curve. A number of abnormalities of this curve can be seen in disease settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A left &quot;shoulder&quot; extension to the curve, or failure of the curve to reach baseline on the left side (ie, RBCs with smaller volumes), can indicate the presence of a population of very small RBCs (eg, microspherocytes or schistocytes), or might be associated with the presence of unusually large platelets (macrothrombocytes) or platelet clumps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A separate RBC population to the left (ie, microcytic RBCs) can indicate the presence of two populations of red cells, as seen in X-linked sideroblastic anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69210\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69210 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sideroblastic-anemias-diagnosis-and-management#H15571650\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sideroblastic anemias: Diagnosis and management&quot;, section on 'X-linked sideroblastic anemias'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A right-sided shoulder usually corresponds to a population of extremely large RBCs (macrocytes) or reticulocytes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trailing erythrocyte population to the extreme right (eg, cells with a MCV &gt;200 fL) can indicate the presence of RBC agglutinins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50522\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50522 \">picture 3</a>), which cause red cells to pass through the aperture in small clumps. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-agglutinin-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold agglutinin disease&quot;, section on 'Anemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p>All pulses in the RBC aperture are enumerated for the RBC count, even if they have an aberrant shape. However, RBCs with an aberrant shape generate a pulse height that is also aberrant and this is edited out of the MCV computation. Thus, the MCV excludes aberrant pulses if derived from an impedance analyzer; in some samples, up to 20 percent of counted RBCs may be excluded from the MCV calculation. Thus, impedance apertures have a limited linear range for particle sizing that can result in an MCHC with a limited range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Red cell distribution width</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The red cell distribution width (RDW), is an indicator of the degree of variation in RBC size (ie, anisocytosis). In Beckman Coulter instruments, the RDW is made equal to the coefficient of variation (CV) of the red cell volume distribution curve, while in some Sysmex instruments, the RDW is equal to the standard deviation of this curve.</p><p>RDW has been proposed as a tool to distinguish iron deficiency (elevated RDW) from thalassemia trait (normal RDW) in samples with low MCV. However, many cases of thalassemia trait were found to have an elevated RDW. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microcytosis-microcytic-anemia#H5830437\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microcytosis/Microcytic anemia&quot;, section on 'RDW (size variability)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet count and size</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9208235\"><span class=\"h3\">Platelet count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelets may be counted in multiple ways: manual microscopy, impedance, light scatter, immunologic methods, and digital image analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Automated platelet counting primarily uses impedance and optical scatter, although immunologic methods are available on some instruments and image analysis is a developing technology. This section will focus on impedance platelet counting with optical platelet counting methods discussed in a subsequent section. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'The optical platelet count'</a> below.)</p><p>Evaluation of patients with abnormally low or high platelet counts (ie, thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, respectively) is discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-thrombocytopenia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of thrombocytopenia in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-thrombocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with thrombocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On instrumentation that uses impedance-based platelet counting, platelets are enumerated as particles in a given range, (eg, from 2 fL up to 30 fL in volume). Similar to RBCs, a frequency curve is generated from a channelized histogram of platelet volumes (eg, raw data curve), and is extrapolated to 70 fL. In contrast to the Gaussian distribution typical of RBCs, platelets show a lognormal or skewed distribution. A mean platelet volume (MPV) is calculated from a log transformation of the platelet volume distribution curve (eg, fitted curve), yielding a geometric mean for this parameter. Fitting a lognormal curve to the raw data can help exclude interferences (eg, microcytic red cells, cytoplasmic fragments, debris, electronic noise) and allows the inclusion of giant platelets with a size greater than 20 fL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72433 \">picture 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-function-testing#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet function testing&quot;, section on 'Platelet counting methods'</a>.)</p><p>Inspection of the platelet histogram can aid in determining inaccuracies in the platelet count; these are typically &quot;flagged&quot; by the instrument to indicate their presence. A peak or spike at the low end (eg, at volumes &lt;2 fL) suggests the presence of cytoplasmic fragments or sufficient interference by electronic noise, while a failure to return to baseline at the high end (eg, volumes &gt;20 to 30 fL) indicates interference by microcytic RBCs or failure to include giant platelets in the count.</p><p>When instrument platelet flags occur, it is important to verify the platelet count by estimation from a peripheral blood smear. In an area of the peripheral blood smear where RBCs barely touch, the number of platelets per 100 power field when multiplied by 20 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> gives an estimate of the platelet count, which can then be compared with the machine-derived count. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-peripheral-blood-smear#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear&quot;, section on 'Platelets'</a>.)</p><p>Different instruments employ varying techniques to detect interferences that can result in a spurious platelet count. Some instruments enumerate particles between 2 to 3 fL (on the low end) and 20 to 30 fL (on the high end) as platelets and monitor the percent of total particles near the lower counting threshold (ie, 1 to 2 fL) and the upper counting threshold (ie, 20 to 30 fL). When the number of particles in these regions exceeds certain limits, &quot;flags&quot; are generated.</p><p>The inability to distinguish platelets from other particles, such as microcytic red blood cells and electronic noise, has been an often cited limitation of impedance methodology. However, some automated hematology analyzers have shown better correlation of their impedance platelet counts with the reference method compared with optical methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Platelet counting using light scattering and other techniques, which obviates many of the problems enumerated above is discussed in a subsequent section. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'The optical platelet count'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Mean platelet volume (platelet size)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mean platelet volume (MPV) is the volume of the average circulating platelet in femtoliters (fL), similar to the MCV for red blood cells.</p><p>The MPV value is determined from the geometric mean of the transformed lognormal platelet volume data in impedance technology systems; or it can be measured using optical technology, where in some systems the MPV is the mode of the measured platelet volume. Thus, the MPV will vary with the method by which it is measured (ie, it is instrument-specific). Further, a patient's true platelet distribution may not fit a log-normal distribution, and manufacturers each specify a defined range of MPV within their algorithms. Thus, one must refer to the laboratory's reference range, which will have been established for that patient population using a specific hematology instrument [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example of the instrument-to-instrument variation, a study examining MPV ranges in adults with normal platelet counts reported that impedance methods had normal values ranging from 6.0 to 13.2 fL, whereas optical methods had normal values ranging from 5.6 to 12.1 fL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Under normal circumstances, there is an inverse relationship between platelet size and number. Therefore, the total platelet mass (ie, the product of the MPV and platelet count or &quot;plateletcrit&quot;) is closely regulated. When platelets decrease in number, bone marrow megakaryocytes are stimulated by thrombopoietin; these stimulated megakaryocytes produce larger platelets. Thus, platelets with a higher MPV are expected to be seen in destructive thrombocytopenia when megakaryocytic stimulation is present. Conversely, platelets with a lower MPV are expected in thrombocytopenic states associated with marrow hypoplasia or aplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Megakaryocyte biology and the production of platelets&quot;, section on 'Regulation of platelet production'</a>.)</p><p>An exception to this relationship occurs with splenic sequestration in which a low MPV is seen because the spleen sequesters large platelets. Similarly, a higher MPV is seen in hyposplenic states since there is no spleen to sequester the larger platelets.</p><p>Many clinicians do not use the MPV because of difficulties associated with this measurement, although most modern hematology analyzers report the MPV, and the literature indicates that MPV measurement <strong>may</strong> have diagnostic utility (eg, as a marker for increased cardiovascular risk, venous thromboembolism, or diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Many laboratories do not report the MPV as a routine part of the CBC, because of technical problems associated with the accurate measurement of MPV (eg, swelling of platelets after prolonged exposure to EDTA, lack of an international standard, reference range of MPV varies with the platelet count).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9208095\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to an abnormal MPV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an otherwise healthy patient without a history of bleeding and with an unremarkable CBC, the MPV is unlikely to be useful in diagnosing an underlying disorder or in predicting an increased bleeding risk.</p><p>For individuals with other abnormalities in the CBC, an abnormal MPV may be helpful in the evaluation, although it cannot be used to confirm or exclude any of the possible diagnoses. In such cases, we first confirm that the abnormal MPV is accurate by ensuring that the patient's blood is drawn and tested within six hours. This may require that the patient have blood drawn in or near the hematology laboratory where testing occurs. Should a clinician order the MPV specifically, the sample should be analyzed after two hours to allow stabilization of platelet shape changes, but without significant further delays.</p><p>We then base our further assessment on whether the MPV is high or low, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <strong>high MPV</strong> in a thrombocytopenic patient indicates active bone marrow production of platelets (eg, as in immune thrombocytopenia [ITP]).

Morphologic features of myelodysplasia or consumptive processes, such as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, can be seen and help lead to a correct diagnosis. Several of the inherited thrombocytopenic disorders have large or giant platelets with leukocyte inclusions. In the patient with ITP, the peripheral blood smear will show normal to large sized platelets, although these features are nonspecific.

In this technique, cells are hydrodynamically focused in a flow cell and illuminated by a narrow beam of laser light. The light scattered by each cell is captured by a photodetector and converted to an electrical pulse; the total number of pulses is proportional to the cell count, while pulse amplitude is proportional to cell volume. The number of pulses within a predetermined size range (eg, 30 to 180 fL for red cells and 0 to 20 [or 30] fL for platelets) yields the corresponding red blood cell (RBC) and platelet counts. White cells can be counted with light scattering technology after lysis of the RBCs.</p><p>By analyzing light scatter at multiple angles, better separation of white blood cells (WBCs) from interferences, such as unlysed RBCs (a problem with neonatal samples, which have difficult-to-lyse RBCs), and nucleated RBCs can be obtained. Some instruments determine both optical and impedance WBC and compare them to look for interferences.</p><p>For erythrocyte evaluation with light scattering technology, the erythroid cells first must be isovolumetrically sphered and fixed. Scattered light is measured at low forward angle (0 to 3 degrees) and high forward angle (5 to 15 degrees), yielding pulses proportional to RBC size and refractive index, respectively. The latter is proportional to the hemoglobin content of the cell, allowing hemoglobin content to be directly determined for individual RBCs. This generates a RBC &quot;cytogram&quot; that allows calculation of RBC volume and Hgb concentration for each individual red blood cell.</p><p>RBC volume and RBC hemoglobin concentration histograms and smoothed curves can be constructed, and the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficients of variation (CV) electronically calculated, yielding the following measurements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red cell distribution width (RDW) (as with impedance methods)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CHM (mean of directly measured HGB content per red cell) and the CHDW (cellular hemoglobin content distribution width)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CHCM (mean of directly measured HGB concentration) and the CHCDW (cellular hemoglobin concentration distribution width)</p><p/><p>The mean value of the directly measured RBC hemoglobin concentration (CHCM) may be decreased and the distribution width of the cellular hemoglobin concentration curve (CHCDW) may be increased in moderate to severe iron deficiency, due to a shift in the percent of hypochromic RBCs. However, these parameters have not proven to be a sensitive indicator of early iron deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H3387816535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Findings on CBC'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">The optical platelet count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a manner similar to optical counting of red cells, an optical platelet count and volume can be determined from two-dimensional analysis of low and high angle light scatter measurements. These two light scatter measurements are related to platelet volume (size) and refractive index (density) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Platelet volume histograms and smoothed curves can be constructed from this plot, and the platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV) and SD or CV of the volume (ie, platelet distribution width, PDW) derived. Interference by microcytic RBC, RBC fragments, and WBC cytoplasmic fragments is eliminated since these particles have a different refractive index than platelets and are not counted.</p><p>Evaluation of patients with abnormally low or high platelet counts (ie, thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, respectively) is discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-thrombocytopenia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of thrombocytopenia in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-thrombocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with thrombocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some Abbott instruments, platelets are first plotted using scattering angles of 90 degrees versus 7 degrees. The ascending angle of the platelet population is determined and a histogram is formed perpendicular to the axis of this angle. Thresholds are set to isolate the platelets from large and small cells and fragments on either side of the histogram. A second histogram is constructed along the main body of this refined platelet population in order to determine the upper threshold separating platelets from microcytic RBCs.</p><p>Some Sysmex instruments provides both a fluorescence optical platelet count and an impedance count, utilizing a computer algorithm to give the best count based on whether, as an example, interference or an abnormal platelet distribution is detected. The fluorescence-based platelet count uses a patented fluorescent dye containing oxazine, which stains mitochondria and rough surface endoplasmic reticulum, and is platelet-specific when used with a dedicated fluorescence channel, thus minimizing interference with red cell fragments, small red blood cells, and white blood cell cytoplasmic fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunologic counting of platelets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunologic method of platelet counting by flow cytometry is now the proposed International Reference Method for enumeration of platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some of Abbott's instruments use an immunologic platelet counting method in which platelets are identified by cluster analysis on a two-dimensional plot of fluorescent monoclonal antibody CD61 reactivity versus high forward angle light scatter. This optional platelet count analysis may be especially useful for very low platelet counts, or when flagged interferences with the platelet count are noted (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-function-testing#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet function testing&quot;, section on 'Flow cytometric methods'</a>).

However, examination of each individual platelet range (hematology analyzer versus immunoplatelet method) showed R2 values below 0.98 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Like reticulocytes, reticulated platelets have an increased RNA content. Measurement of the RNA content of platelets with thiazole orange dye can be useful in the diagnostic classification of thrombocytopenia and in monitoring recovering thrombopoiesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51649\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51649 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

These alternatives include the use of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), which interacts with hemoglobin to form an SLS-Hgb derivative, methemoglobin conversion with imidazole as the heme-ligand, and azide methemoglobin conversion. These methods may show less interference from substances that spuriously elevate HiCN measurement via increase in turbidity, such as high WBC, high triglycerides, or the presence of poorly soluble (at room temperature) IgM paraproteins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOMATED COUNTING OF RETICULOCYTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Automated counting of reticulocytes became available at the start of the 1990s, significantly improving the precision of reticulocyte counts as compared with manual counting. A reticulocyte is defined in this methodology as the stage of erythrocyte development following loss of its nucleus in which the cell still contains measurable amounts of RNA. Automation provides an absolute reticulocyte count (ie, the number of reticulocytes per microL of blood), as well as the reticulocyte percentage, as a percent of all red cells (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H38\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Reticulocyte count'</a>). Automation often involves use of a fluorescent dye, such as nucleic acid binding dyes, including thiazole orange, first used in flow cytometry. As well as yielding a reticulocyte count, an immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) can be measured as the sum of the reticulocytes with medium and high fluorescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Features of the combined absolute reticulocyte count and IRF are characteristic of different disease states and may be clinically useful in classifying anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Reference intervals for the IRF are dependent on each method used.</p><p>Automated reticulocyte counts are included on most automated hematology analyzers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Siemens Advia instruments stain reticulocytes with Oxazine 750 and measure light adsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

High, medium, and low fluorescent fractions are also calculated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (CHr), measured on the Siemens Advia instruments, appears to be a sensitive and specific indicator in detecting iron deficiency, monitoring iron therapy in patients with renal failure on chronic dialysis, and monitoring for the advent of iron deficiency following treatment with erythropoietin in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The reticulocyte parameter (RET-Y), a raw measure dependent on size and content of the cell, generated by the Sysmex XE 2100 has been reported to correlate with the CHr and may also prove useful in monitoring iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another reticulocyte index, the mean reticulocyte volume, has been proposed to be helpful in diagnosing iron deficiency, monitoring response to treatment of nutritional anemias, an early indicator of erythropoiesis after bone marrow transplantation, and as a tool in the evaluation of erythropoietin abuse in athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/27,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32-34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some Abbott instruments use a proprietary fluorescent RNA dye called CD4K540 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This dye is 10 times as bright as Auramine O and fluoresces at 530 nm (green). A plot of seven degree light scatter versus fluorescence separates platelets from RBC and very highly fluorescent non-viable WBC and nucleated RBC from the reticulocytes. The combined RBC and reticulocytes are gated; a histogram of the mature RBC plus reticulocyte fluorescence is analyzed with a valley-finding algorithm to separate and enumerate the reticulocytes.

Red cells are measured for volume, conductivity, and laser light scatter; the latter signal is proportional to the residual RNA within the red cell. Reticulocyte volume is measured, and those reticulocytes with the most RNA (corresponding to those reticulocytes in the highest light scatter regions) are measured. The DxH 800 captures five laser light scatter measurements for each cell, in contrast to one light scatter measurement for the <span class=\"nowrap\">LH750/780</span>.

Attempts to automate this process started with image analysis instruments in the 1970s and progressed to a flow-through automated differential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">The three-part differential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differentiating leukocyte subsets in liquid suspension, rather than on a stained smear, began in the 1980s. Flow-through automated differentials were first performed using standard electrical resistance or impedance technology. A weak lysing reagent resulted in lysing of the RBCs and shrinking of the leukocyte membranes about the nucleus, resulting in three peaks of leukocyte subsets in the normal individual:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphocytes and basophils in the smallest size group (35 to 90 fL)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segmented and band neutrophils and eosinophils (&quot;granulocytes&quot;) in the largest size group (&gt;160 fL)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monocytes and other mononuclear cells, including immature granulocytes and a portion of the eosinophils, were found in a smaller intermediate size peak between 90 and 160 fL</p><p/><p>The presence of abnormal cells obscured the valleys between these three peaks, resulting in error &quot;flags&quot; and inaccurate counts. The &quot;granulocyte&quot; fraction did not always give a true absolute neutrophil count, particularly if significant numbers of bands, immature granulocytes, or eosinophils were present. In addition, increased numbers of bands and eosinophils, as well as more extreme abnormalities (eg, blasts, reactive lymphocytes, nucleated RBC) all give flagged samples, resulting in a slide review rate &gt;30 percent for a hospital inpatient population. Thus, the three-part differential functioned best in the situation of screening a largely normal population for potential abnormalities.</p><p>Many of the smaller automated hematology instruments still use this technology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">The five-part differential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five-part differentials were first introduced in the early 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Different instrument manufacturers all report at a minimum the basic five leukocyte subsets (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) and have flags to detect the presence of abnormal cells (eg, blasts, nucleated RBC, reactive lymphocytes, lymphoma cells, mononuclear granulocytes). In fact, many of the newer analyzers report a seven-part differential, including the quantification of immature granulocytes and nucleated red blood cells. Performance in the detection of these abnormalities varies; most instruments are &gt;90 percent sensitive in detecting large numbers of abnormal cells (ie, when the population exceeds 5 percent), but lack sensitivity to low frequency abnormalities (ie, &lt;5 percent). Although these instruments claim to flag increases in band neutrophils, sensitivity and specificity for detection of elevations in this cell type are poor.</p><p>The current generation of instruments use a combination of technologies for the leukocyte differential, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impedance volume with direct current (DC)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiofrequency (RF) conductivity (with impedance aperture)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser light scattering</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peroxidase staining</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Propidium iodide fluorescence (for nucleated RBC and non-viable cells)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell-specific lysing reagents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymethine <span class=\"nowrap\">RNA/DNA</span> histone dye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digital imaging</p><p/><p>Both DC and RF methods use impedance technology in which a cell breaks electrical current generated across an aperture opening, producing a voltage change.

Instruments contained on-board computers to perform curve fitting, multi-dimensional population cluster discrimination, quality control data, and moving averages for quality control. In addition, there is sufficient memory to store and sort samples and to store a finite number of sample scatterplots in &quot;list&quot; mode for reanalysis.</p><p>Analyzers now include an automated sampling mode. Blood is aspirated from closed tubes, with automated bar code readability, minimizing operator contact with the blood, and allowing for positive sample identification. A built-in mixing system ensured sampling of a well-mixed specimen, and instruments usually included a sample aspiration monitor to aid in detecting the presence of clots and determining that the correct sample volume has been aspirated. Sporadic tests, such as reticulocytes or an automated differential, can be selected by random access and performed only when ordered, saving reagent costs. Automated slide makers also are available that can produce and stain blood films as directed by laboratory-programmed algorithms, which consider both the results of specific parameters as well as the presence of instrument flags. The combination of automated hematology analyzers coupled with automated slide makers and stainers have resulted in automated hematology workcells which offer high throughput and increased efficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The current generation of automated hematology instruments uses laser light scatter, fluorescence, <span class=\"nowrap\">DNA/RNA</span> dyes, and monoclonal antibodies to expand the scope of the automated differential.

Common sample problems leading to these results include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A very high WBC, lipemia, or a precipitating monoclonal protein, all of which produce turbidity in the HGB colorimetric method, will result in a spuriously high HGB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a cold agglutinin spuriously decreases the RBC count since RBCs go through the counter in small groups, rather than one-by-one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Artificial hemoglobin-containing solutions increase HGB without an increase in RBC count. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen carriers as alternatives to red blood cell transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Spurious decrease in the MCHC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A true decrease in the MCHC can be seen in iron deficiency anemia. However, a high glucose concentration (due to hyperglycemia in the patient or contamination of the blood sample with an intravenous solution containing glucose) causes temporary osmotic imbalance in the diluted RBC in the analyzer chamber, causing them to swell with water for a short period, spuriously increasing the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and decreasing the MCHC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet error flags</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelet error flags by automated instruments are important because they may indicate an erroneous platelet count. Examples include electronic noise, cell cytoplasmic fragments, and microcytic RBCs, all of which can cause a spurious increase in the platelet count. The platelet count can be spuriously decreased when giant platelets are present, since such large platelets may be omitted from the platelet count because of their extreme size. As an example, platelets can be larger than red cells in some patients with the May-Hegglin anomaly. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Platelet count and size'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia#H629365\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Pseudothrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p>Verification of the platelet count by slide estimate is usually the first step if flags occur, and, if necessary, a manual phase contrast microscopy method is used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-peripheral-blood-smear\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukocyte counting errors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interferences at the lower <span class=\"nowrap\">size/volume</span> threshold of WBC counting can be an important clue to the presence of artifacts. These include sample clotting, platelet clumping or giant platelets that can lead to spuriously low platelet counts, high WBC counts, and high percent lymphocytes. Most instruments flag significant particle interference in this region.</p><p>Most instruments also flag the automated leukocyte differentials when significant interferences are identified. A slide review is usually necessary to validate the instrument results and detect the presence of abnormal cells (eg, atypical lymphocytes, blasts).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet clumping with pseudothrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelet clumping can occur, either due to in vitro blood clotting or in association with an EDTA-dependent platelet agglutinin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68949\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68949 \">picture 5</a>). Often these platelet clumps are so large that they are beyond the threshold for particle size included in the platelet histogram, leading to spuriously low platelet counts. These platelet clumps are the same size as small WBC and can spuriously increase the WBC count. Nucleated RBCs and non-lysing RBCs show a similar interference pattern.</p><p>If a slide examination confirms the presence of platelet clumps, it is likely that the platelet count is spuriously low and that the WBC count is spuriously high. If clotting of the blood sample is present, the sample should be redrawn. A correct platelet count can often be obtained for patients with an EDTA-dependent platelet agglutinin by collecting the blood in citrate anticoagulant (and multiplying the results by the dilution effect from the liquid anticoagulant), or by using a heparinized blood sample, in which case there is no need to correct for dilution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTED AUTOMATED HEMATOLOGY INSTRUMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of commercially available automated hematology instruments, which differ in the methodologies used for determination of the individual elements of the complete blood count (CBC). Some of these are listed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Beckman Coulter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of Beckman Coulter models are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. The Beckman Coulter DxH <span class=\"nowrap\">800/LH780/LH750</span> report the white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct, calculated), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH, calculated), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC, calculated), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count, and mean platelet volume (MPV). A five-part differential includes percent and absolute number of total neutrophils, total lymphoid cells, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. When specifically ordered, reticulocytes (percent and absolute number) are analyzed and reported, as well as an immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF). The DxH 800 and <span class=\"nowrap\">LH750/LH780</span> also enumerate nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs), a feature not present on earlier instruments, using the combination of impedance, conductivity, and laser light scatter.</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">LH750/LH780</span> uses electric impedance technology to enumerate WBC, RBC, and platelet counts, and to determine RBC and platelet volume. The <span class=\"nowrap\">RBC/platelet</span> aperture centers cells by virtue of its architecture (very long and narrow). In addition, sweep flow and pulse editing technology is employed. Hemoglobin is determined by CN-methemoglobin colorimetry. The five-part differential (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) is generated by analyzing events in a flow cell with three different technologies: volumetric impedance using direct current (related to cell size or volume), conductivity using high frequency electromagnetic energy (signal related to internal cell complexity), and laser light scatter (related to both cell size and structure). Approximately 8000 events are classified using these methods. Data are plotted in a three-dimensional matrix (VCS), and clusters are identified as specific cell populations. If the populations are not in expected locations, or a significant number of events are detected outside of the population clusters, flags are generated, indicating that abnormal cells may be present, as well as a need for manual slide review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The DxH 800 enumerates NRBCs using a whole blood sample that is diluted and lysed to remove non-nucleated cells and is then directed through the flow cell. Seven parameter measurements are captured characterizing size, shape, and morphology, and these data are analyzed using proprietary algorithms. This analyzer features high-definition digital signal processing and flow cytometric digital analysis using volume, conductivity and multi-angle light scatter, and is notable for a trackless magnetic transport system that contains no exposed moving parts. Reports on the evaluation of NRBCs in neonates using the DxH 800 have shown better correlation with the reference manual technique compared to other analyzers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/51,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,54</a>]. The LH500 reports the presence of NRBCs as a flag, but does not specifically enumerate them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Siemens Advia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Advia <span class=\"nowrap\">120/2120</span> reports the WBC, RBC, Hgb, Hct (calculated), MCV, MCH (calculated), MCHC (calculated), RDW, platelet count, and MPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Research parameters include directly measured RBC hemoglobin content (mean = CH, SD = HDW) and directly measured RBC hemoglobin concentration (mean = CHCM, SD = CHDW) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/27,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,56</a>].</p><p>A six-part differential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65298 \">figure 4</a>) includes percent and absolute number of neutrophils, lymphoid cells, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and large unstained cells (LUC, which includes reactive lymphocytes, blasts, and other abnormal cells). When specifically ordered, reticulocyte percent and absolute number are reported, as well as an immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF). Reticulocyte MCV and RDW, as well as directly measured reticulocyte hemoglobin content and concentration parameters, similar to those for mature erythrocytes, are available as research parameters. Instrument flags indicate the presence of potential interferences with individual parameters.</p><p>The Advia instruments count RBCs by electronic impedance, but measure their volume by two-dimensional laser light scatter, after sphering and fixing the erythrocytes. A RBC cytogram computes the volume and Hgb concentration for each individual erythrocyte. From this information, RBC volume and Hgb concentration curves can be constructed. Hgb concentration is also determined by colorimetry with a sodium lauryl sulfate-hemoglobin derivative.</p><p>RBC volume and RBC Hgb concentration histograms and smoothed curves, as well as the MCV and RDW, are reported. In addition, a number of erythrocyte research parameters can be obtained on alternate displays. These include the CHM (mean of directly measured Hgb content), the HDW (SD of the Hgb content, or RBC hemoglobin distribution width), the CHCM (mean of directly measured Hgb concentration) and the CHDW (SD of the Hgb concentration, or RBC hemoglobin concentration distribution width). The Advia 120 has been used to quantify schistocytes and has shown a high negative predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The percentage of hypochromic red cells (%HYPO) and reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) have been shown to be a useful tool in diagnosing iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>For platelet enumeration and sizing, the platelets are sphered, fixed, and counted by laser light scatter in two dimensions, similar to RBC analysis. This technique allows discrimination between platelets on the one hand and RBCs (microcytic RBCs, RBC fragments, and ghosts) and WBCs on the other, because the latter sets of particles have a different refractive index than platelets. Platelet volume histograms and smoothed curves can be constructed from this plot, and the platelet count, MPV and SD or CV of the volume (PDW) derived.</p><p>The WBC is determined by duplicate methodologies. The WBCs are fixed and counted in the optical peroxidase channel as well as enumerated in the dual laser light scatter basophil flow cell with stronger lysing reagent. If interference at the lower counting threshold is noted in the peroxidase channel due to unlysed RBCs, the WBC count from the basophil channel is used.</p><p>A six-part WBC differential is performed by cytochemical and laser light scattering technology. After lysing the RBCs, WBCs are fixed and stained for myeloperoxidase using 4-chloro-1-naphthol substrate at 50 to 70&deg;C. Stained cells are hydrodynamically focused through a flow cell illuminated by tungsten-halogen light, where light scatter as well as light absorption of individual cells is measured with a pair of photodetectors. The data are displayed in a two-dimensional scattergram, plotting cell size (light scatter) versus peroxidase activity. In addition to discriminating between neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils, a sixth population, large unstained cells, is enumerated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65298 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Because myeloperoxidase activity is employed in this method for obtaining the WBC differential, neutrophils in patients with myeloperoxidase deficiency will be enumerated under the population of &quot;large unstained cells.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myeloperoxidase-deficiency-and-other-enzymatic-wbc-defects-causing-immunodeficiency#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myeloperoxidase deficiency and other enzymatic WBC defects causing immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'Myeloperoxidase deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Basophils are classified in a separate <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;basophil/lobularity&quot;</span> channel. Using a strong lysing agent, both RBCs and WBCs are lysed, leaving only bare nuclei, except for basophils, which are resistant to this agent. The remaining <span class=\"nowrap\">nuclei/cells</span> are analyzed with two-angle laser light scatter. Basophils appear the largest, while the smaller bare nuclei can be analyzed as well. The mononuclear round cells scatter the least light, while lobulated cells scatter the most, generating a lobularity index. This information is used to detect the presence of blasts and mononuclear left-shifted neutrophils.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Abbott</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Abbott Sapphire reports the WBC (optical), RBC (impedance), RBC (optical), Hgb, Hct (calculated), MCV, MCH (calculated), MCHC (calculated), RDW, platelet count (optical and impedance), MPV, and PDW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The machine also calculates a plateletcrit, the percent of the sample's volume (ie, cells plus plasma) occupied by platelets. The five-part differential includes percent and absolute number of neutrophils, lymphoid cells, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Nucleated red blood cells are enumerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], and a nucleated <span class=\"nowrap\">RBC/WBC</span> ratio is given. A leukocyte viability fraction is also given. When specifically ordered, reticulocyte percent and absolute number are analyzed and reported, as well as an immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF). In addition, research screens on the instrument enumerate blasts, atypical lymphocytes, and immature granulocytes. Instrument flags indicate the presence of potential interferences for individual parameters.</p><p>RBCs are counted by both impedance and laser light scatter, using hydrodynamically focused and sphered RBCs for both measurements. The impedance measurement is used for RBC count and size parameters. A two-dimensional optical RBC count serves to validate the impedance count. Using multi-angle light scatter and fluorescence, a three-dimensional RBC differential analysis has been generated allowing automated analysis of normal and abnormal red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Hemoglobin is measured colorimetrically using a cyanide-free reagent (methemoglobin method with imidazole as the heme-ligand). Sodium hydroxide and lauramine oxide dissolve all cell particles and lipids and destroy bilirubin, minimizing interferences.</p><p>Platelets are enumerated by both optical and focused impedance methods. The optical platelet count and volume is determined from two-dimensional analysis of low and high angle light scatter measurements. Platelets are first plotted using 90 degree versus 7 degree scattering. The ascending angle of the platelet population is determined and the histogram is formed perpendicular to the axis of the angle. High and low thresholds are set to isolate the platelets from large and small cells and fragments. A second histogram is constructed along the main body of this refined platelet population to determine the upper threshold separating platelets from microcytic RBCs. Interference by microcytic RBCs or RBC fragments and WBC cytoplasmic fragments is eliminated, since these particles have a different refractive index than platelets. Once the platelet particles are identified, the platelet count, MPV, PDW, and PCT are determined.</p><p>The impedance platelet count appears as a lognormal distribution and serves to validate the optical count. Flagging of the impedance platelet count occurs when a high percentage of particles are noted near either the lower or upper counting threshold.</p><p>Optional platelet enumeration by immunologic analysis is available on the Sapphire. Platelets are identified by cluster analysis on a two-dimensional plot of fluorescent monoclonal antibody CD61 (directed against glycoprotein IIIa) reactivity versus high forward angle light scatter. The CD61 immunoplatelet method correlates the closest with the flow cytometry reference method for platelets, compared with impedance and optical platelets on the Sapphire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Using the CD61 method as a gold standard compared with impedance and optical methods results in platelet undertransfusion and overtransfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>WBCs are counted by laser light scatter. Events are considered &quot;WBC&quot; using analysis in three dimensions: size (0 degree scatter), complexity (7 degree scatter), and DNA fluorescence. Only events that exceed lower thresholds for these three measurements qualify for being counted. Thresholds are set low enough to capture all true WBCs, but exclude significant noise. Further analysis eliminates nucleated RBCs, RBCs resistant to lysis, platelet clumps, and other interfering materials from the final white blood cell count.</p><p>For the leukocyte differential, blood is diluted with a leukoprotective diluent that maintains the leukocytes close to their native state and includes propidium iodide (PI) to enumerate nucleated RBCs and assess leukocyte viability. Mature erythrocytes are rendered transparent to laser light and do not produce light scatter under these conditions. The WBC dilution is hydrodynamically focused through the sensing region of a laser beam. Laser light scatter is measured at multiple angles, including (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77105\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77105 \">figure 5</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 degree measurement is related to cell size (axial light loss from incident ray)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>7 degree measurement is related to internal complexity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>90 degree measurement is related to lobularity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>90 degree depolarization measurement is specific for eosinophilic granules</p><p/><p>In addition, red fluorescence is measured, which is proportional to the amount of DNA in each cell that has become membrane compromised, such that the PI reagent has access to the cell nucleus. Up to 10,000 events are classified, and the measurements are stored in list mode, allowing the algorithm to work through the data incrementally.</p><p>The first step involves a two-dimensional plot of 0 degrees versus fluorescence, to separate the cells which pick up the DNA stain, either nucleated RBCs or WBCs that are fragile or leaky. Based on the 0 degree size, these fluorescent cells are separated into nucleated RBC (red) or fragile white cells (white). The nucleated RBC particles are eliminated from further analysis, while the fragile WBCs are identified by subpopulation in further steps.</p><p>In the next step, mononuclear (blue) and polynuclear cells (orange) are separated by a plot of 7 degree versus 90 degree light scatter.</p><p>The polynuclear (orange) cells are analyzed with polarized laser light, so that eosinophils (green) can be identified within this fraction by the ability of their granules to depolarize light at 90 degrees.</p><p>The mononuclear cells (blue) are plotted in two dimensions (7 degree versus 0 degree light scatter) to define the basophil region (white). Once the basophil region is defined, floating thresholds separate the lymphocytes (blue) and monocytes (purple) using a histogram along the 0 degree size axis with the basophils removed. The remaining events below the lymphocytes (gray) are non-WBC (and non-nucleated RBC) events, and if in sufficient number, may indicate significant interference from RBCs resisting the lysing reagent.</p><p>Finally, a plot of fluorescence versus 0 degree size is reviewed again, with classified leukocytes appropriately colored. Non-viable leukocytes (highly fluorescent) can be identified, and a viability ratio is calculated.</p><p>The plots of the various populations are analyzed for abnormal populations of cells by proprietary algorithms. Flags are reported if abnormal populations are identified. The neutrophil population is analyzed for the presence of bands and immature granulocytes, the mononuclear population is analyzed for the presence of blasts, variant lymphocytes are identified using data on both viable (non-fluorescent) and non-viable (highly fluorescent) lymphocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Sysmex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Sysmex XN series report the WBC <span class=\"nowrap\">(optical/fluorescent),</span> RBC (impedance), Hgb, Hct (from measurements of RBC pulse heights), MCV, MCH (calculated), MCHC (calculated), RDW-SD, RDW-CV, platelet (impedance), platelet (alternate, <span class=\"nowrap\">optical/fluorescent),</span> MPV, PDW, P-LCR (the percent of larger platelet) and a plateletcrit (PCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/31,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,64,65</a>]. A seven-part differential including immature granulocytes and NRBCs, and hemoglobin equivalent parameters is also reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The five-part differential includes percent and absolute number of neutrophils, lymphoid cells, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Nucleated red blood cells are also enumerated. Hematopoietic progenitor cells are reported as a research parameter. When specifically ordered, reticulocyte percent and absolute number are analyzed and reported, as well as an immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF), which is the sum of the moderately and highly fluorescent reticulocytes (MFR+HFR).</p><p>XE series instruments use impedance apertures for RBC and platelet counting and sizing, with hydrodynamic focusing and back sweep flow technologies. The RDW is expressed in terms of both SD and CV. The impedance platelet count is fitted to a lognormal distribution; flagging of this count occurs when a high percentage of particles is noted near either the lower or upper counting threshold. In addition, an <span class=\"nowrap\">optical/fluorescent</span> platelet count is determined when the impedance platelet count is flagged, or when the platelet count is less than 30 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(30,000/microL)</span>. A computerized switching algorithm will give a best platelet count if both methods are enabled on the analyzer. Hemoglobin is determined colorimetrically using sodium lauryl sulphate.</p><p>The leukocyte count and differential are performed using a combination of DC and RF measurements, as well as laser light scatter (forward and side) and fluorescence with a polymethine <span class=\"nowrap\">DNA/RNA</span> histone dye. XE instruments contain a semiconductor diode laser with a short oscillation wavelength (630 nm), measuring fluorescence in the near red region.</p><p>Four different lysing reagents are employed. First, RBC are lysed with a strong acid hemolytic reagent, removing even lysis-resistant RBC as well as platelet aggregates. Basophils are resistant to lysis, and can be separated from other WBC in a side versus forward light scattergram. The WBC count is measured as the sum of the basophil and other leukocyte events.</p><p>The second step involves a lysing reagent that acts on the leukocyte membrane to allow dye passage. The fluorescent polymethine dye stains DNA, RNA, and histones. A plot of side light scatter versus fluorescence separates lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils plus basophils, and eosinophils. Total neutrophils are computed by subtracting the number of basophils measured in step one. In the third step, a lysing reagent is used to completely expose and shrink the nuclei of the nucleated erythrocytes. The WBCs, however, retain their cytoplasm, and are semi-permeabilized. The polyamine dye stains the small nucleated RBC nuclei and the larger WBC nuclei as well as the WBC cytoplasmic organelles. A plot of side fluorescence versus forward light scatter separates nucleated RBC from the WBC and the non-nucleated RBC ghosts and membrane fragments. An &quot;IMI (immature cell information) channel&quot; is used to detect small numbers of immature granulocytes, blasts, and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Quantitation of immature granulocytes has been used by some authors as a predictor of infection comparable to the absolute neutrophil count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The granularity index has been reported as a useful indicator of neutrophils with toxic granulation on the XE-5000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Cells with a higher content of lipid are lysed with a fourth hemolytic reagent, while immature cells retain their membranes. The sample is analyzed in an impedance aperture with direct (DC) and radiofrequency (RF) current. In normal samples, no intact cells are seen in the IMI area. The information from the IMI channel is used to generate flags for left shift, immature granulocytes, and blasts, and to enumerate hematopoietic progenitor cells. Additional flags for abnormal cell types occur as abnormal cell populations are detected in the plot of side light scatter versus fluorescence in step two.</p><p>Reticulocytes and the IRF are determined using the same polymethine dye capable of staining reticulocyte RNA in a special diluent. A plot of fluorescence versus forward light scatter separates mature RBC from reticulocytes, and enables enumeration of highly fluorescent reticulocytes. Small size platelet and highly fluorescent WBC do not interfere. When the impedance platelet count shows interference, the platelet count is determined from a log-scaled version of this plot. The fluorescent platelet RNA enables separation of platelet from RBC fragments. Fragmented red blood cells can also be quantitated on some instruments; this is performed using the reticulocyte channel in which RBC fragments are gated from the RBC area (small size, low RNA content) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/automated-hematology-instrumentation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].
