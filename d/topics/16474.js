Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) has proven efficacy in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma, but it requires regular injections at a clinician's office (typically over a period of three to five years) and carries the risk of potentially serious systemic allergic reactions in response to the treatment itself.</p><p>The alternate approach of administering allergens orally, and more specifically with a sublingual methodology in which the allergen is given as either a dissolvable tablet (under the tongue) or as an aqueous or liquid extract, has evolved into a viable treatment for allergic respiratory diseases. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) offers several specific advantages over injection immunotherapy. SLIT can be self-administered by patients or caregivers, does not require injections, and carries a much lower risk of anaphylaxis compared with SCIT. This topic will discuss the mechanisms of action, advantages, and limitations of SLIT for allergic rhinitis and the most common methods of administering immunotherapy via an oral route: sublingual immunotherapy tablets (SLIT-tablets) and sublingual aqueous or glycerinated liquid preparations (SLIT-drops).</p><p>The use of SCIT for the treatment of allergic respiratory diseases is discussed separately.

In the 1980s, properly designed clinical trials first demonstrated a dose-dependent therapeutic response with specific and well-characterized aeroallergens. In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized that SLIT was a promising alternate mode of immunotherapy and encouraged continued clinical investigation into this form of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 2009, the World Allergy Organization (WAO) published their opinion that the cumulative evidence showed SLIT represented a viable alternative to SCIT and encouraged continued clinical investigation to characterize optimal techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19446756\"><span class=\"h1\">DELIVERY SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several types of allergen preparations have been studied in SLIT. The following forms are most promising:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sublingual immunotherapy tablets (SLIT-tablets)</strong> &ndash; Allergen is formulated into a rapidly dissolving tablet that is held under the tongue until completely dissolved. The majority of United States clinical studies have defined a single optimal dose based on prior dose-ranging safety studies. The tablets are self-administered, once daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sublingual aqueous or glycerinated liquid allergen extracts (SLIT-drops)</strong> &ndash; An aqueous or liquid (eg, glycerinated) extract of allergen, generally administered as drops, is held under the tongue for a specified period of time, and then the residual is swallowed. The allergen is taken up through the rich vascular lymphoid network of the mouth. Oral solutions that are held in the mouth for a period of time, but then spit out rather than swallowed, have also been evaluated in clinical trials. However, holding the extract under the tongue appears more efficient for delivery of active drug.</p><p/><p>Other approaches to oral immunotherapy that have been investigated in research trials include administration of the allergen(s) as enteric-coated tablets, liposomal constructs, or microencapsulated polymers. These oral (swallow) delivery systems are intended to protect the allergenic proteins from breakdown in the stomach and then allow a pH-dependent release in the small intestine for processing by the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). However, research studies with these constructs have not demonstrated evidence for effective delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009978433\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of studies of SLIT have been performed with pollen allergens in patients with allergic rhinitis. There are a smaller number of studies of dust mite immunotherapy. The use of food allergens or latex allergens in oral immunotherapy is discussed separately.

The ragweed tablet is approved in Canada (2014).

The issues regarding this practice are discussed below.

The normal response of the gut immune system to nonpathogenic proteins is tolerance, a fact which forms the basis for the concept of oral immunization.</p><p>The gut immune system is comprised of various physical barriers, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and lymphoid organs (mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and liver). Within the GALT, areas of importance for antigen processing are the tonsils and adjacent ring of lymphoid tissue in the posterior pharynx and the Peyer's patches of the duodenum, jejunum, and small intestine. The GALT is essential for normal tolerance to most foreign proteins, as well as in the immunologic response to oral immunotherapy. The role of the GALT in the pathogenesis of food allergy is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Allergens used in SLIT are usually intended for absorption either in the mouth or within the small intestine, as the conditions of the gastric environment (pH and other factors) destroy many allergenic proteins. Whether the immunologic response to allergens absorbed through the oral mucosa is different from that to allergens absorbed through the intestine is an area of ongoing investigation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergen extracts given sublingually are primarily taken up by dendritic cells in the mucosa and presented to T cells in the draining lymph nodes. Likely mechanisms of action include activation of T regulatory cells and downregulation of mucosal mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Within the oral and sublingual mucosa, effector cells, such as mast cells, are less numerous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This characteristic of the oral mucosa is believed to be an important factor in the lower rates of adverse systemic allergic reactions seen with SLIT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergenic proteins that reach the small intestine are processed through columnar mucosal cells and presented to T lymphocytes within Peyer's patches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Allergen processing within the GALT is discussed in greater detail separately.

Systemic tolerance occurs as a result of a decline in T helper mechanisms or stimulation of T suppressor cells involved in immunoglobulin E (IgE) production.

IgG4 production may be regulated by IL-10, and SCIT has been shown to induce T regulatory cells to produce IL-10. IL-10 downregulates T helper type 2 (Th2)-dependent inflammation and suppresses B cell isotype switching to IgE.

Trials involving each of the main forms of SLIT are reviewed below.</p><p>In a 2011 systematic review of 60 randomized trials (published through 2009) that included approximately 2300 adults and children receiving active SLIT treatment (tablets or drops) or placebo, treatment with SLIT resulted in a statistically significant reduction in symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] of -0.42 [95% CI -0.69 to -0.15]) and in medication requirements (SMD of -0.43 [95% CI -0.63 to -0.23]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Most studies involved treatment with single pollens (most commonly grass) or house dust mite preparations at a range of doses. Fifteen studies included only children, with results that were similar to those in adults. There was a trend for greater improvement with treatments lasting longer than one year. Local side effects (oral pruritus and swelling, throat irritation) and nausea were more common with active treatment, although systemic adverse effects (rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis) were equal in active treatment and placebo groups. No trial reported anaphylaxis or the need to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.

The decision as to what represents a sufficient therapeutic effect must be tempered by the risk:benefit ratio of the therapeutic agent. Traditionally, the bar has been set somewhat higher for a treatment such as injection immunotherapy, where the risks (ie, anaphylaxis induced by the injections) were perceived as relatively significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For an allergen immunotherapy therapeutic agent to get approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), two statistical efficacy criteria must be met: (1) the TCS must demonstrate an average relative difference of 15 percent compared with placebo, and (2) the upper bound of the 95% CI must be &le;-10 percent.

This is based on a 2016 study that compared pooled efficacy data from 10 randomized trials of SLIT-tablets (for treatment of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis) with data from studies of pharmacotherapy and found that SLIT-tablet treatment resulted in an overall improvement in total nasal symptom scores of 16 to 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Limitations of this analysis included the fact that most SLIT studies allowed for use of rescue medications, while trials of pharmacotherapy generally did not, which would potentially underestimate the effect of SLIT. However, this study design also provides evidence for the additive effects of SLIT beyond pharmacotherapy. Another limitation of the analysis was the lack of trials employing combinations of pharmacotherapies, which would more closely simulate &quot;maximal medical therapy.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2008095864\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy compared with placebo</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26391459\"><span class=\"h4\">Grass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized trials (through 2014) evaluating grass pollen SLIT-tablet immunotherapy found a treatment benefit on symptom score (SMD, -0.28; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.19) and medication score (SMD -0.24; 95% CI -0.31 to -0.17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Similar findings were shown for the entire ragweed season (18 and 27 percent reduction, respectively). The 1.5 unit dose also reduced TCS, but not to a statistically significant degree.

This construct has gained acceptance in Europe and is being studied in clinical trials in the United States. In the United States, phase 1 studies on safety and tolerability have been carried out with ragweed, grass, house dust mite, and cat glycerinated extracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>A 2013 systematic review, which included 63 randomized-controlled trials and 5131 subjects, was performed to determine if there was evidence that SLIT with aqueous or liquid drops, <strong>performed with products equivalent to those available in the United States for use in subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT)</strong>, were safe and effective for allergic asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Studies were only included if the methods could be replicated using allergen extracts available in the United States. A meta-analysis of efficacy could not be performed, because of the heterogeneity among studies, and the authors did not comment on efficacy. Instead, the authors summarized the quality of the evidence that SLIT-drops improved symptoms scores, need for medication, and quality of life for allergic asthma, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. There were no reports of anaphylaxis, confirming that SLIT-drops are well-tolerated. For allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, the quality of the evidence that SLIT was effective was deemed &quot;moderate,&quot; as defined in the GRADE (<strong>G</strong>rading of <strong>R</strong>ecommendations <strong>A</strong>ssessment, <strong>D</strong>evelopment, and <strong>E</strong>valuation) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Furthermore, many of the studies included were smaller phase 1 or 2 studies intended to evaluate safety, clarify dose, or examine mechanisms of action. In several instances, the clinical trials did not achieve significance for their primary endpoint and were only able to show an effect for secondary endpoints or upon subgroup analyses. This type of evidence does not meet the more rigorous standards required by various regulatory bodies and task forces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/43,45,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45,75</a>].</p><p>Additional important limitations noted by the authors of the review, and which directly impact the ability of clinicians to create protocols with proven efficacy using SLIT-drops, included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conclusions about effective dose ranges could not be drawn, because the dosing units used in European products and American products are not interchangeable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of multiple allergen immunotherapy was not clear, which is important because most patients receiving subcutaneous injection immunotherapy in the United States are sensitized to multiple allergens and are treated with multiple allergens.

Of primary importance is the question of effective dose.</p><p>It is our opinion that the only definitive way to evaluate newer forms of immunotherapy, including SLIT-drops, is to use products with doses defined in well-established units (eg, micrograms of major allergen or bioequivalent allergy units [BAU]). A small number of studies have been performed on North American or European populations that meet this requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/76,79-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,79-85</a>].

The study drug was administered sublingually via a calibrated dropper and held under the tongue for two minutes, with any residual liquid swallowed. Ninety-four percent of study subjects achieved the maximum tolerated dose (50 mcg Amb a 1). As consistent with accepted methods for assessment of SLIT studies, the primary endpoint was the total combined daily rhinoconjunctivitis symptom and medication scores, and the active treatment arm reported a 43 percent improvement in the primary endpoint as compared with the placebo group (difference versus placebo -0.83 [95% CI -1.30 to -0.37]). Expected increases in ragweed-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), the predictive biomarker associated with symptom improvement in SCIT, were also observed in the active treatment group. No serious adverse events or anaphylaxis occurred. This North American study provides the first conclusive evidence that SLIT with a liquid preparation using well-established (standardized) allergen units (ie, mcg Amb a 1) can result in highly significant and clinically meaningful therapeutic benefit in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grass</strong> &ndash; In a multicenter, randomized trial of 207 children with grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis (with or without asthma), subjects were treated with 40 mcg daily of grass pollen from six grass species or placebo in SLIT-drops held under the tongue for three minutes and then swallowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Treatment was administered daily January through August initially, and then all patients received daily active open-label treatment for two additional years. The primary endpoint was the change of the area under the curve of the symptom medication score from the baseline season to the first season after start of treatment. The area under the curve of the symptom medication score was approximately twofold lower in the active treatment group. Allergen-specific IgG4 increased significantly in the active group also.

Product inserts specify that patients should temporarily discontinue therapy if oral inflammation (eg, thrush, mouth ulcers, oral lichen planus) or oral wounds (eg, following dental surgery or tooth extraction) are present.

Although only 23 percent used any asthma medications, a relative difference in median asthma symptom score was observed in the active treatment group versus placebo-treated children, and use of asthma &quot;relief&quot; medication was nominally lower in the active treatment group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435188605\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate-persistent asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fewer studies have included patients with moderate-persistent asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/63,67,88,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,67,88,118</a>]. These have shown that SLIT is well-tolerated, although the degree of improvement in asthma symptoms appears to be relatively modest.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial that did include such patients evaluated whether SLIT-tablet therapy could reduce the need for inhaled glucocorticoids. This trial enrolled 604 adolescent and adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, allergic rhinitis, and sensitization to house dust mite who required low-to-medium doses of inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> (100 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Patients were randomized to one of three doses of house dust mite SLIT-tablet or to placebo. The minimal dose of inhaled budesonide required to control asthma symptoms was measured at the outset and after one year of house dust mite SLIT-tablet therapy. There was a modest but statistically significant reduction in the amount of budesonide required (81 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day)</span> in the group receiving the highest dose of house dust mite SLIT (6 standardized-quality units, SQ-HDM) compared with placebo, but not in the groups receiving the lower doses (3 and 1 SQ-HDM). Thus, based on this limited data, SLIT appears to be well-tolerated and possibly helpful in patients with asthma requiring low-to-moderate doses of inhaled glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study also found SLIT to be safe and to have measurable benefits in patients with moderate-persistent asthma. This randomized trial included 834 adults with mild or moderate asthma not well-controlled by inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> and short-acting beta-agonists, given one of two doses of house dust mite SLIT-tablet or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. About 40 percent of patients required high doses (800 to 1200 mcg) of budesonide daily at enrollment. Patients received house dust mite SLIT or placebo for 7 to 12 months, after which budesonide therapy was reduced by 50 percent for 3 months, then discontinued entirely for the next 3 months. The primary outcome was time to first moderate or severe asthma exacerbation during the period of budesonide withdrawal. Both doses of house dust mite SLIT prolonged this time compared with placebo. The absolute risk for a first moderate-to-severe exacerbation during budesonide <span class=\"nowrap\">reduction/discontinuation</span> was 26 and 24 percent for the lower- and higher-dose SLIT, respectively, which were statically significant differences compared with placebo (32 percent). The absolute risk difference in the higher dose SLIT group compared with placebo was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.02-0.16). However, asthma-related quality of life assessment were not different among the three groups. Thus, in patients with mild or moderate asthma not controlled on inhaled glucocorticoids, house dust mite SLIT was safe, and delayed time to exacerbation during steroid withdrawal, although a clinically meaningful improvement in asthma symptoms, was not clearly demonstrated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929762738\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLIT has not been sufficiently studied in patients with severe asthma, although the limited data that are available are reassuring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. Accordingly, all SLIT-tablet products available in the United States and Canada are labeled as contraindicated in patients with severe, unstable, or uncontrolled asthma.

The analysis included 36 randomized, controlled trials of over 3000 treated patients and a similar number of placebo-treated controls. To account for the methodologic variation among the studies, results were converted to standardized mean differences. Although indirect and limited by a very high degree of heterogeneity, this analysis showed greater overall benefit with SCIT compared with SLIT.</p><p>A small number of trials have directly compared SLIT and SCIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/35,120-127\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,120-127</a>]. Three randomized trials involved head-to-head, double-dummy protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/35,120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,120,121</a>]. Although each study had methodologic issues and small numbers of patients, two of three found SCIT to be at least somewhat more effective than SLIT.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The earliest study included 20 adults monosensitized to grass (and without asthma) treated with SLIT-drops or SCIT, which found that both therapies resulted in reductions in symptoms and medication scores of at least 50 percent after one year of therapy. However, there was no placebo arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. In contrast, immunologic measures of efficacy, such as allergen-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), changed only in the group receiving SCIT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent trial involved 58 birch-allergic adults (one-third with asthma) treated with either SLIT-aqueous or SCIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Some were also sensitized to other allergens. Rhinitis disease severity was significantly reduced in both treatment arms compared with placebo, although the two therapies were not statistically different from each other.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third trial, 30 children, all with both rhinitis and asthma and monosensitized to house dust mite, were randomized to SLIT-drops, SCIT, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. SCIT significantly reduced rhinitis and asthma symptoms and medication use. SLIT modestly reduced symptoms for both rhinitis and asthma and medication use for rhinitis, but the changes with SLIT were not statistically significant compared with placebo. The doses given were also not quantified in terms of micrograms of allergen, so it was difficult to assess whether SLIT dosing was adequate.</p><p/><p>Other reviews have identified a few additional studies, although these studies were not as rigorous as those described already and reached the same conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/128-130\" class=\"abstract_t\">128-130</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Issues requiring further study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further research is needed in several areas, in addition to optimizing dosing and delivery systems. Incompletely answered questions include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/43,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,91</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Can SLIT alter the progression of allergic disease?</strong> &ndash; A small number of studies have addressed the question of whether oral forms of immunotherapy can be used to alter disease progression or prevent the onset of other allergic diseases. The preventative effects of immunotherapy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease: Indications and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Preventive effects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What is the optimal duration of therapy?</strong> &ndash; Both SLIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/48-50,53,54,57,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50,53,54,57,91</a>] and SCIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/131-133\" class=\"abstract_t\">131-133</a>] can produce clinical benefit within three to four months, and both appear to have some persistent benefit after therapy is discontinued, although the optimal duration of SLIT has yet to be defined. (See <a href=\"#H288550305\" class=\"local\">'Persistence of therapeutic benefit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>How effective is SLIT for the polysensitized patient?</strong> &ndash; The most compelling data for use of SLIT is in the monosensitized pediatric or adult patient with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with or without mild asthma. Nearly all of the high quality studies available have shown benefit in this context. However, the typical patient in North America is sensitized to multiple aeroallergens, both seasonally and perennially. The few multiple allergen studies performed in the United States have not shown clinical benefit. In one study, 54 grass-allergic patients were randomized to placebo, monotherapy with Timothy extract (19 mcg Phl p 5 daily), or Timothy extract plus nine additional unstandardized pollen extracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. A modest positive trend was observed in clinical parameters in the multiple pollens group, which did not reach clinical significance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, a posthoc analysis of data from six randomized trials of grass pollen tablet immunotherapy, including 1871 adults and children, found no significant difference in the benefit reported by patients who were monosensitized to grass and those who were polysensitized to grass and other allergens during the grass pollen season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. This analysis does not address the question of whether SLIT with one allergen has any effect on patients' symptoms from exposure to other allergens, a controversy that also applies to SCIT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scit-preparation-of-allergen-extracts-for-therapeutic-use#H15449436\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;SCIT: Preparation of allergen extracts for therapeutic use&quot;, section on 'Multiple allergen immunotherapy extracts'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, until a full range of oral products has been produced, tested, and made commercially available, it is not clear that it would be practical or cost-effective to combine SLIT (eg, grass SLIT-tablet) with SCIT in a patient with multiple allergen sensitivities as opposed to simply continuing SCIT to cover all the allergens relevant to that patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What is the minimal amount of time required to see a clinical effect?</strong> &ndash; The minimal amount of time required to see a clinical effect with SLIT may vary somewhat depending upon the allergen (seasonal versus perennial), as well as the type of study design used to address the question. For example, clinical trials of grass or ragweed tablets have shown that treatment effect is optimized with initiation of treatment 12 to 16 weeks prior to the onset of pollen season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/49-51,56,57,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51,56,57,60,61</a>]. In contrast, an environmental chamber study design with house dust mite SLIT demonstrated an early onset of action at eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], whereas a natural field trial showed an onset of action at four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H843438258\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

There are two forms of SLIT with inhalant allergens that have been widely studied: dissolvable sublingual tablets (SLIT-tablet) and sublingual allergen extracts (SLIT-drops). The most consistent results have been obtained with SLIT-tablet formulations. (See <a href=\"#H19446756\" class=\"local\">'Delivery systems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SLIT has been shown in randomized trials to be effective for allergic rhinitis (with or without conjunctivitis) and safe for patients with concomitant mild-to-moderate asthma. However, efficacy in reducing the symptoms of persistent, not well-controlled allergic asthma has not been conclusively demonstrated. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Specific studies and efficacy data'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Patients with concomitant asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SLIT has been used in Europe and some other countries for decades for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. In the United States, a 5-grass pollen tablet, a single grass pollen tablet, a short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ragweed-pollen-sublingual-tablet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ragweed pollen sublingual tablet</a>, and a house dust mite tablet are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F95082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95082 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Availability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SLIT is self-administered by patients (or their caregivers) at home, although the initial dose is usually given under medical supervision. A significant percentage of patients experience local application site reactions (eg, oral pruritus, throat irritation, tongue swelling), but systemic allergic reactions are markedly fewer as compared with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). Local reactions subside in many patients within a few days to a week. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main advantages of SLIT over SCIT are safety and the comfort and convenience of an oral therapy that is self-administered. SLIT appears to be somewhat less effective than SCIT, based upon meta-analyses and a small number of direct comparison studies. The main disadvantage of SLIT is that it requires the patient to be consistently compliant with therapy, and the impact of missed doses on efficacy is difficult to assess.
