In addition to trauma, common etiologies of myelopathy include autoimmune, infectious, neoplastic, vascular, and hereditary-degenerative diseases. The relative incidence of each of these entities depends in large part upon the clinical setting. In a regional neuroscience center in the United Kingdom, the most common cause of spastic paraparesis or quadriparesis among 585 patients was cervical spondylotic myelopathy (24 percent), followed by tumor (16 percent), multiple sclerosis (18 percent), and motor neuron disease (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review some of the more common and important causes of nontraumatic spinal cord dysfunction. Clinical features of the more common of these disorders are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50336\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50336 \">table 1</a>). Traumatic spinal cord injury and the anatomy and clinical localization of spinal cord disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLAMMATORY DISEASES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transverse myelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transverse myelitis (TM) is a segmental spinal cord injury caused by acute inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. TM is uncommon, with an approximate incidence of between one to five cases per million population annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Most cases of TM are idiopathic and presumably result from an autoimmune process; up to half of these patients have a preceding infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. TM can also occur in multiple sclerosis (MS) and can be the presenting demyelinating event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Neuromyelitis optica or Devic's disease is a disorder related to MS, in which demyelinating events are limited to the optic nerve and spinal cord. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromyelitis-optica-spectrum-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TM is also associated with connective tissue diseases, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/6,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed connective tissue disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sjogren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/6,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scleroderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ankylosing spondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p/><p>The inflammation of TM is generally restricted to one or two segments, usually in the thoracic cord. Symptoms typically develop rapidly over several hours; approximately 37 percent of patients worsen maximally within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Occasionally patients worsen more slowly, over several weeks. Typically the inflammation is bilateral, producing weakness and multimodality sensory disturbance below the level of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. Unilateral syndromes (eg, Brown Sequard) have been described as well. Almost all patients develop leg weakness of varying severity. Arm weakness also occurs if the lesion is in the cervical cord. In addition to diminished sensation, pain and tingling are common and frequently include a tight banding or girdle-like sensation around the trunk, which may be very sensitive to touch. Back and radicular pain are also common. Bowel and bladder dysfunction, reflective of autonomic involvement, also occur.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the involved section of the spinal cord shows gadolinium-enhancing signal abnormality, usually extending over one or more cord segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73197\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73197 \">image 1</a>). [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/5,8,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,19,20</a>]. The cord often appears swollen at these levels. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is abnormal in half of patients, with elevated protein level (usually 100 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/100</span> mL) and moderate lymphocytosis (usually &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">/mm3)</span>. Glucose levels are normal. Oligoclonal bands are usually not present in isolated TM, and when present suggest a higher risk of subsequent MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>]. Other studies can help delineate the underlying cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65585 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Most patients with idiopathic TM have at least a partial recovery, which usually begins within one to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Some degree of persistent disability is common, occurring in about 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22</a>]. Significant recovery is unlikely if there is no improvement by three months. A very rapid onset with complete paraplegia and spinal shock have been associated with poorer outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/6,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22,23</a>]. TM is generally a monophasic illness. However, a small percentage of patients may suffer a recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>While patients are often treated with parenteral corticosteroid therapy, there is limited evidence that this approach alters outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/6,8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,22</a>]. Patients with TM associated with systemic autoimmune disease may be more likely to receive treatment corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>MS is more likely to develop in those with partial and asymmetric cord involvement versus a complete cord syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. A finding of demyelinating lesions on brain MRI also identifies those at higher risk for MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Acute and subacute transverse myelitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sarcoidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The granulomatous inflammation of sarcoidosis can affect the spinal cord and produce an acute or subacute segmental myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/6,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29-31</a>]. The lesions can be extramedullary or intramedullary, and can involve the cauda equina as well as the cord. MRI signal abnormalities are not specific; neurosarcoid lesions can appear similar to transverse myelitis or can resemble a tumor. CSF evaluation usually shows elevated protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pleocytosis. Hilar lymphadenopathy may suggest the diagnosis; however, serum and CSF angiotensin converting enzyme levels are neither sensitive nor specific for neurosarcoidosis. Patients with neurologic sarcoidosis are generally treated with corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory agents and can improve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Paraneoplastic syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of distinct paraneoplastic syndromes involving the spinal cord have been described. These rare syndromes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor neuron syndrome &mdash; a subacute, progressive, painless, and often asymmetric lower motor neuron weakness, most often associated with lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute necrotizing myelopathy &mdash; a rapidly ascending syndrome of sensory deficits, sphincter dysfunction, and flaccid or spastic paraplegia or quadriplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute sensory neuronopathy &mdash; an inflammatory disorder affecting the dorsal root ganglia, producing progressive loss of sensory modalities, leading to prominent ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This is most often associated with small cell lung cancer and anti-Hu antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encephalomyelitis &mdash; a diffuse involvement of brain and spinal cord regions, in which cerebral manifestations frequently overshadow the myelopathy. Several syndromes are described.</p><p/><p>These are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidural abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal epidural abscess is a rare disease, occurring in only 1 patient per 10,000 admitted to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The infection can originate via contiguous spread from infections of skin and soft tissues or as a complication of spinal surgery and other invasive procedures, including indwelling epidural catheters. Other cases of epidural abscess arise from a remote site via the bloodstream. Diabetes, alcoholism, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are risk factors.</p><p>The most common pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus, which accounts for about two-thirds of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Damage to the spinal cord can be caused by direct compression of neural elements or arterial blood supply, thrombosis and thrombophlebitis of nearby veins, focal vasculitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacterial toxins and mediators of inflammation. The classic clinical triad consists of fever, spinal pain, and neurologic deficits. However, only a few patients have all three components at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The rate of neurologic progression is highly variable.</p><p>Imaging of the spinal column is imperative on first suspicion of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred test and is highly sensitive for this diagnosis. Blood cultures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aspirate of abscess contents are ordered to identify the etiologic organism. Surgical decompression and drainage with systemic antibiotic therapy is the treatment of choice for most patients. Because the preoperative neurologic deficit is an important predictor of final neurologic outcome, early diagnosis and treatment are imperative.</p><p>This topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-epidural-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal epidural abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute viral myelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two distinct syndromes of spinal cord involvement are associated with acute viral disease. In the first, the virus targets the gray matter of the spinal cord, producing acute lower motor neuron disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These viruses include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteroviruses, such as poliovirus, coxsackie virus, and enterovirus 71 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]</p><p/><p>Viral invasion of the anterior horn cells occurs as part of an acute viral illness, usually with fever, headache, and meningismus, and produces asymmetrical flaccid weakness with reduced or absent reflexes and few sensory symptoms or signs. MRI often shows hyperintensities in the anterior horns of the spinal cord on T2-weighted imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/38,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,42</a>]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrates a moderate pleocytosis. These features help to distinguish this form of viral myelitis from Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, which usually produces symmetric deficits, with no MRI abnormalities, and is associated with elevated CSF protein levels without pleocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Focal or segmental depletion of spinal motor neurons has been described at autopsy, reflecting the observed pattern of neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The prognosis for recovery is variable. Treatment is supportive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of West Nile virus infection&quot;, section on 'Neuroinvasive disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Acute paralysis and brainstem encephalitis'</a>.)</p><p>A second form of viral myelitis has clinical and diagnostic test features that are similar to transverse myelitis. Associated viruses include cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C, and Epstein Barr virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/45-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-51</a>]. The association between the myelitis and the virus is not always clear. In some cases, these may represent a postinfectious transverse myelitis. In others, a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test in the CSF suggests that the myelitis is directly related to the viral infection. These patients are often treated with antiviral agents and corticosteroids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">AIDS myelopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection produces a vacuolar myelopathy, which is found in up to half of patients with AIDS at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/36,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,52</a>]. However, clinical manifestations occur when the pathology is advanced, and only about one-fourth of patients demonstrating vacuolar myelopathy at autopsy have symptoms during life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. AIDS myelopathy most often occurs in late stages of AIDS; most patients die within six months of developing symptoms of myelopathy. HIV-related dementia is present in more than half of patients and, with other disease complications, may obscure the myelopathy.</p><p>In typical cases, a slowly progressive spastic paraparesis is accompanied by loss of vibration and position sense and urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Upper-extremity function is usually normal. MRI of the spine is usually normal. CSF examination may show nonspecific abnormalities, such as protein elevation. Abnormal sensory evoked potentials may precede clinical symptoms of myelopathy. Aggressive antiretroviral therapy can lead to improvement of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In one case series, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin appeared to be associated with neurologic improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of vacuolar myelopathy is unknown, but may be related to abnormal transmethylation mechanisms induced by the virus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytokines. In one series of 16 patients, there was no correlation between the viral load in the CSF and the presence or severity of myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Pathological descriptions include demyelination of the dorsal columns and the dorsal half of the lateral columns, with prominent vacuoles within the myelin sheaths. This pathologic appearance is similar to the changes seen in the subacute combined degeneration of the cord.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">HTLV-1 myelopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) causes a progressive neurologic disease, which is called either HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) or tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. This disorder is endemic in southern Japan, the Caribbean, South America, the Melanesian islands, Papua New Guinea, the Middle East, and central and southern Africa, with seroprevalences as high as 30 percent in southern Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. In contrast, it is quite rare in the United States and Europe. It is more common in women than men.</p><p>Primarily involving the thoracic cord, <span class=\"nowrap\">HAM/TSP</span> is characterized by a slowly progressive spastic paraparesis and urinary disturbance. Pathologic studies demonstrate inflammation of the lateral corticospinal, spinocerebellar, and spinothalamic tracts, with relative sparing of the posterior columns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">HAM/TSP</span> has also been associated with other nervous system pathology that results in less frequent symptoms, suggesting cerebral, cerebellar, cranial nerve, and peripheral nerve involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/57,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,61</a>].</p><p>MRI of the spinal cord may show spinal atrophy, particularly of the thoracic cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/58,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,63</a>]. A brain MRI often shows subcortical, periventricular white matter lesions. CSF examination reveals a mild lymphocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated protein concentration in some patients. Anti-HTLV-I antibodies are detected in the CSF with a high <span class=\"nowrap\">CSF/serum</span> ratio. The virus can be cultured from CSF lymphocytes and proviral DNA detected by PCR.</p><p>In general, neurologic deficits continue to progress slowly; steroids and other immunomodulatory treatment may slow progression, but this is not proven.

In the former situation, a subacute progressive myelopathy develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In the latter, the clinical presentation may be one of a spinal cord infarction.

Infection of the vertebral body leads to tuberculous spondylitis or Pott's disease, which can lead to secondary cord compression. These patients present with back pain over the affected vertebra, low grade fever, and weight loss, followed by a secondary compressive myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Tuberculomas within the intramedullary, intradural, and extradural space can also produce myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].

The lower thoracic region of the spinal cord is most frequently involved, followed by the lumbar and sacral regions. Spinal cord involvement can lead to permanent paralysis.

These exist on the dural surface, and drain intradurally by retrograde flow through a single medullary vein to the anterior or posterior median vein, resulting in engorgement of the coronal venous plexus. They usually present after the fifth decade of life and are more common in men. The most common clinical presentation is that of progressive, often step-wise myeloradiculopathy, probably related to venous hypertension. Some patients present with neurogenic claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

HSP is classified according to the mode of inheritance, the genetic locus when known, and whether the spastic paraplegia syndrome occurs alone or is accompanied by additional neurologic or systemic abnormalities (&quot;pure&quot; versus &quot;complicated&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/158-162\" class=\"abstract_t\">158-162</a>].

Inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, but recessive and X-linked variants (eg, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease) are known. </p><p>The typical patient with pure HSP will have a slowly progressive spastic paraparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. The age of onset can vary from infancy to the eighth decade. The first symptoms are often gait disturbance or urinary urgency. Examination reveals spasticity, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and impaired vibration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> joint position sense. Weakness may be demonstrated but is rarely the major cause of disability. Upper limb involvement is generally limited to hyperreflexia.</p><p>HSP is a clinical diagnosis, based in large part on the family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. MRI may be normal or may show atrophy in the spinal cord. Thinning of the corpus callosum on brain MRI is seen in half of patients with the autosomal recessive form of HSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. Otherwise, the diagnosis is based on careful exclusion of other etiologies.

As opposed to the more common and severe phenotype of adrenoleukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy generally presents in adult men or in female carriers of the mutation. Sensory and sphincter disturbances are typically absent. There may be mild adrenal insufficiency. MRI is typically normal. In the absence of a family history, the finding of a neuropathy on electrophysiologic testing may be a clue to the disorder. The diagnosis is made by the finding of increased very long chain fatty acids in plasma, red blood cells, or cultured skin fibroblasts.

The neuropathologic changes in Friedreich ataxia include degeneration of the posterior columns and the spinocerebellar tracts of the spinal cord and loss of the larger sensory cells of the dorsal root ganglia. These findings correspond to the clinical manifestations of progressive ataxia of all four limbs and gait, weakness, absent reflexes with extensor plantar responses, loss of position and vibration sense, and sparing of pain and temperature. Cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus are part of the syndrome. Patients with late-onset disease are more likely to have retained reflexes, spasticity, and no cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>]. MRI may show atrophy of the cervical cord. Disease severity and rate of progression are highly variable. There is no treatment. This topic is discussed separately.
