Children learn language in early childhood; later they use language to learn. Children with language disorders are at increased risk for difficulty with reading and written language when they enter school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. These problems often persist through adolescence or adulthood. Early intervention may prevent the more serious consequences of later learning disabilities.

A hearing aid, as an example, can be prescribed for a child with a language disorder resulting from hearing loss, whereas surgery may be considered for a resonance disorder secondary to nasal polyps or enlarged adenoids. By comparison, for many speech and language disorders, the etiology cannot be clearly identified, or the disorder is one manifestation of a larger condition. In these cases, the goals of the assessment are to describe the impairment and recommend a plan for intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A case illustrating the major features of the speech and language evaluation is presented separately.

The speech and language pathologist uses data gathered from various sources to perform this assessment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History obtained from the child's parents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous evaluations (eg, hearing, vision, intelligence, emotional)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test results and observations derived from contact with the child</p><p/><p>A parental history can be obtained with a questionnaire that includes detailed developmental, medical, social, behavioral, and school histories and a description of the parents' perception of the problem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57023%7EPEDS%2F68758%7EPEDS%2F76584%7EPEDS%2F55605\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef57023 graphicRef68758 graphicRef76584 graphicRef55605 \">form 1A-D</a>). For school-age children, having information from teachers regarding performance in the language, social, academic, and behavioral areas is helpful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56349%7EPEDS%2F69113\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef56349 graphicRef69113 \">form 2A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician asks the parents questions that clarify or enhance information that has been submitted on the questionnaire. The responses on the questionnaire and the interview provide data that help to determine whether the child has had a favorable, stimulating environment in which to develop speech and language skills at a level consistent with his or her chronologic age and overall potential.</p><p>Information about the child's cultural and linguistic background is necessary to appropriately assess and treat speech and language impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Children who are more proficient (dominant) in a language other than English should have at least part of their evaluation conducted in their dominant language. Children who speak a language other than English should be tested in their native language; evaluations should be performed by a speech language pathologist who is fluent in the child's native language. An interpreter must be employed if a fluent speech and language pathologist is not available. Potential problems in the use of interpreters include errors in translation, failure of the interpreter to share information from the case history interview, and a tendency of the interpreter to minimize problems. The occurrence of such problems can be reduced by thoroughly training interpreters in the diagnostic process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Standardized tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The value of standardized tests as the sole tool for the assessment of communication problems has been challenged because &quot;standardized tests destroy the fundamental social-interactive quality of communication. Many of the tests attempt to isolate and measure particular aspects of communication&quot; without considering the others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, some objective tests do provide quantitative measures of a child's specific skills. In addition, objective scores often are necessary for placement in special education programs and are useful for subsequent comparison. Standardized assessment tools that are chosen carefully and used appropriately provide worthwhile information.</p><p>The child's performance in specific speech and language areas, such as phonologic ability, vocabulary comprehension, and grammatic usage, is measured objectively using the most recently standardized, norm-referenced tests for a particular age group. No uniformly applicable test battery for this assessment exists; the clinician uses his or her expertise to select from among the large number of tests available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation and qualitative analysis of performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observation and qualitative analysis of the child's performance supplement objective test results and are essential for making a diagnosis and devising a treatment plan. In the very young or uncooperative child, parental report and observation of the child at play provide the information necessary to make judgments about the precursors of speech and language development: the adequacy of speech and language, nonverbal cognition, and social interaction. Precursors of normal speech and language development are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64162\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64162 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>For older children, the clinician can gather important data about the child's ability to communicate in conversational situations through close observation during informal interaction with the child or watching the child's interaction with his parent or sibling. In the qualitative analysis, the skilled clinician looks at how the child arrived at the answer, instead of whether the answer was right or wrong. As an example, does the child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Require repetition or shortening of the question to understand it?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use his or her hands excessively or grope for words during responses?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Run out of breath while talking?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Become dysfluent or hypernasal as the length of the stimulus increases?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstrate appropriate problem-solving strategies?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Show poor ability to respond to suggestions?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Require excessive time for comprehending <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> responding?</p><p/><p>The clinician should note the kinds of test modifications that were helpful to the child, such as repeating instructions and stressing key words, shortening the length of the stimulus, prodding or encouraging to take risks, requiring eye contact during oral instruction, or encouraging repetition of instruction before proceeding. These subjective observations provide valuable information for making the diagnosis and for devising a management plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Instrumented observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computers, fiberoptic instruments, and radiologic studies augment the evaluation of swallowing, voice, and resonance disorders. As examples, computers are used to analyze the acoustic properties of voice and speech; the vocal folds can be viewed directly with fiberoptic instruments; and videofluorography assists in the examination of the oral mechanism during speaking and swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Reporting results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final report should include the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nature of the problem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A description of how the problem affects the child's function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The strengths of the child that will enable him or her to compensate for the weaknesses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendations for management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A program for implementing the recommendations</p><p/><p>The clinician should communicate this information to the child's parents at a conference and in writing. The clinician can choose to have the child present at this meeting or to have a separate conference with the child to present the information at a level that he or she will understand.</p><p>A definitive diagnosis cannot always be made during the initial assessment. In these cases, the assessment provides a baseline for comparison with follow-up assessment (monitoring). Diagnostic therapy may be recommended for those children for whom more observation is necessary before arriving at a diagnosis or determining a management plan (eg, children who are frightened in the clinical setting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Specific suggestions for appropriately stimulating language should be given to parents, teachers, and others involved in the child's care. As an example, providing a language model that is appropriate to the child's linguistic development (eg, sounds, single words, phrases, simple sentences) is important. Parents may be advised to comment about daily activities rather than overusing direct questioning that may decrease verbal output from the child. Parents are encouraged to accept less than perfect productions (eg, word approximations) when the child's intent is clear. In a systematic review, better language outcomes were achieved when parents were taught how, specifically, to stimulate language in their children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Children with speech and oral language disorders are at high risk for developing learning disabilities (eg, academic problems) when they enter school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. Parents should know how to advocate for their children in the school system by making sure they get the services they need and ensuring the condition is monitored through periodic reevaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment plan for a child with speech or language disorder is tailored to his or her individual needs, but all treatment plans have common components. Baseline data are used to set short-term, long-term, and functional outcome goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The speech and language pathologist then employs facilitation techniques to elicit specific changes in the child's behavior. Some clinicians use a highly structured approach in which the principles of behavior modification (stimulus-response-reinforcement) are strictly followed; others use a less structured intervention that is more child-led. As an example, &quot;enhanced milieu teaching&quot; is an intervention that occurs in play-based interaction sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A combination of high- and low-structure approaches may be appropriate, depending upon the type of problem and the stage of the therapeutic process.</p><p>Functional outcomes are outcomes that can be measured in terms of experience in the child's life; they extend beyond the individual treatment session to the real world environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Children differ in their abilities to apply what is learned in one context to other contexts. As an example, children often have difficulty using new speech or language skills in situations other than the treatment setting. Collaboration with family members, caregivers, and educators in helping the child exercise these new skills is a key factor in the success of the treatment.</p><p>Emphasis on the practice of inclusion in public schools has been increasing; children with special needs (eg, speech and language impairments) are served within the classroom rather than being pulled out for treatment. However, evidence demonstrating improved progress for children with language disorders in inclusion settings has not been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In addition, some types of intervention are more suited to inclusion settings than are others. The carryover practice for a learned skill, as an example, works well in an inclusion setting. In contrast, new skills may be better acquired in individual therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of speech and language impairment may include one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enrollment in individual or group speech and language therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy through a private facility or the public school system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attendance at a specialized school for children with speech, language, and learning differences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further assessment in specific areas (eg, oral, motor, psychologic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Application of assistive technology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodic monitoring without direct therapy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predictors and risk factors to consider when making the decision to initiate intervention are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52412\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52412 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Though few studies have examined the effect of timing of intervention on outcome, early intervention usually is recommended. This preference was illustrated in a study in which 30 preschool-age children with severe phonologic disorders were randomized to receive four months of therapy followed by four months of no treatment or four months of no treatment followed by four months of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The children in the early therapy group had greater improvement in speech intelligibility at both four and eight months.</p><p>Early intervention also improves language skills in children with delayed language [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In one study of 21 toddlers with delayed language development who were randomly assigned to early versus delayed treatment groups, the early treatment group showed improvement in each of five linguistic outcomes: mean length of utterance; total number of words; number of different words; lexical repertoire; and percentage of intelligible utterances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These children also had improved socialization skills and decreased levels of parental stress.</p><p>However, early intervention for delayed language may not change the long-term outcome, as illustrated in a study that examined the narrative language skills of untreated children with and without a history of delayed expressive language (ie, late talkers) as toddlers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Children with normal language skills had better narrative language skills in kindergarten and first grade than did those with language delay, but by the second grade, no difference was found among the groups.</p><p>Although many variables must be considered, and criteria may be difficult to objectify, the positive effects of lowering frustration for the child and family and maintaining the child's self-esteem render early intervention worthwhile in many cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic outcomes have been described in diverse patient populations, including children with articulation, voice, fluency, and language disorders.
