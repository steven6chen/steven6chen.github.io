Although <em>Candida</em> are considered normal flora in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts of humans, they have the propensity to invade and cause disease when an imbalance is created in the ecologic niche in which these organisms usually exist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-candida-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of Candida infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The immune response of the host is an important determinant of the type of infection caused by <em>Candida</em>. The different <em>Candida</em> species generally are capable of producing all of the clinical syndromes, although infection with <em>Candida albicans</em> is the most common. The major importance of identifying the infecting organism is that some species are more resistant to the azole antifungal agents than others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the manifestations of <em>Candida</em> infection involving the abdomen and thorax.

Discrete abscesses with or without peritonitis can occur.</p><p><em>Candida</em> peritonitis can also complicate continuous peritoneal dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease. This disorder is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fungal peritonitis in continuous peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other intraabdominal manifestations of <em>Candida</em> infection include isolated pancreatic abscess, gangrenous cholecystitis, and obstruction to the common bile duct with a <em>Candida</em> fungus ball [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>]. <em>C. albicans</em> is the predominant species isolated in intraabdominal candidal infections, but <em>C. glabrata</em> has assumed an increasing role at some centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The symptoms of <em>Candida</em> peritonitis do not differ from those of bacterial peritonitis, which also is often present. Fevers, chills, and abdominal pain are prominent. Complications include abscess formation and bloodstream invasion with sepsis.</p><p>The diagnosis is best made by aspiration of fluid under computed tomographic (CT) or ultrasound guidance or at the time of surgery. Growth of <em>Candida</em> species from an abscess or peritoneal fluid should lead to the diagnosis of invasive intraabdominal candidiasis and to appropriate treatment with an antifungal agent. Culture of <em>Candida </em>species from an indwelling drain is not adequate for the diagnosis of infection because it often reflects only colonization of the drain.</p><p>Blood cultures are frequently negative in patients with intraabdominal candidiasis. In a multicenter study of 481 patients with intraabdominal candidiasis, only 68 (14 percent) had positive blood cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A retrospective review of 163 patients with intraabdominal candidiasis between 2012 and 2013 at a single center noted that 55 percent had abscesses and 33 percent had secondary peritonitis that originated with a gastrointestinal source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The remaining patients had pancreatitis with necrosis, cholecystitis, cholangitis, and primary peritonitis. Bacterial infections coexisted in 67 percent of these patients, and only 6 percent had candidemia. Source control within five days and antifungal therapy within five days were each implemented in 72 percent of patients. Overall mortality was 28 percent, but mortality among those who had primary or secondary peritonitis was 88 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Abscesses, early source control, and young age were independent predictors of decreased mortality.</p><p>The serum beta-D-glucan assay appears to be a useful test in patients with intraabdominal candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Beta-D-glucan is present in the cell wall of many fungi, including <em>Candida</em> spp. In a prospective cohort study that included 89 patients who had been in the intensive care unit for &ge;72 hours and who were considered to be at high risk for intraabdominal candidiasis because of recurrent gastrointestinal tract perforation or acute necrotizing pancreatitis, 29 (33 percent) developed intraabdominal candidiasis; 27 of 29 patients (93 percent) had negative blood cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The median beta-D-glucan result was 253 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> in patients with intraabdominal candidiasis compared with 99 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> in patients who were colonized with <em>Candida</em>; a beta-D-glucan result &gt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> is considered positive. The sensitivity and specificity of two consecutive positive beta-D-glucan results for predicting intraabdominal candidiasis were 65 and 78 percent, respectively. Beta-D-glucan results became positive in patients with intraabdominal candidiasis a median of five days before the diagnosis was confirmed by culture of intraabdominal specimens. Conversely, a negative beta-D-glucan test in a patient at risk for intraabdominal candidiasis is highly predictive of the absence of invasive candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Thus, obtaining a beta-D-glucan test on admission to the intensive care unit in patients with intraabdominal events, such as bowel perforation or necrotizing pancreatitis, may help point the clinician to a diagnosis of possible intraabdominal candidiasis. This assay does not supplant cultures, which are needed to identify which specific fungal species might be causing infection. The beta-D-glucan assay is discussed in greater detail separately.

Surgical management involves drainage of abscesses and relief of biliary tract obstruction. Adequate source control was independently associated with improved survival in a retrospective study of intraabdominal candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Depending on the location of the abscess, drainage can often be performed by an interventional radiologist, obviating the need for a laparotomy. Initial antifungal therapy is similar to that for candidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The preferred initial treatment is an echinocandin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a> 100 mg intravenously [IV] daily; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anidulafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anidulafungin</a> 200 mg loading dose, then 100 mg IV daily; or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caspofungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caspofungin</a> 70 mg loading dose, then 50 mg IV daily) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87676 \">table 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> (800 mg [12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> loading dose, then 400 mg [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> orally daily) is an alternative that can be used in patients who are not critically ill, who have not been treated recently with fluconazole, and who are not considered likely to have a fluconazole-resistant isolate (eg, not colonized with a fluconazole-resistant species, such as <em>C. glabrata</em>)<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]<em>.</em> A lipid formulation of amphotericin B (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV daily) is another alternative, but it is used infrequently because of the greater toxicity (particularly nephrotoxicity) of this agent.</p><p>Following identification of the infecting species, treatment can be modified as follows, provided that the patient is clinically stable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For fluconazole-susceptible species, such as <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (800 mg [12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> loading dose, then 400 mg [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> orally daily) can be used.

The pathogenesis of lung involvement is that of hematogenous spread rather than aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. Thus, multiple microabscesses are found scattered widely throughout the lung parenchyma, and lobar infiltrates are uncommon. Autopsy studies from cancer centers have documented that primary <em>Candida</em> pneumonia, in which infection is limited to the lungs, occurs in less than 1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Much more commonly, the lungs are one of many organs involved in the course of disseminated infection with <em>Candida</em> in immunosuppressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. In a review of a 20-year experience from the MD Anderson Cancer Center, there were only 31 cases of clearly documented primary <em>Candida</em> pneumonia in over 7000 autopsies in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In one study of 17 hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who had histologically proven pulmonary candidiasis, the computed tomographic (CT) findings included multiple nodules ranging from 3 to 30 mm in diameter in 15 patients. Air-space consolidation was present in 11 patients and, in 5, nodules were surrounded by discrete areas of ground-glass opacity (CT halo sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Studies in both cancer patients and nonneutropenic patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting have confirmed the lack of specificity of sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens for the diagnosis of pulmonary invasion by <em>Candida</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/21,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23-25</a>]. Among 36 cancer patients with autopsy evidence of <em>Candida</em> pneumonia in whom sputum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> BAL were performed &le;4 weeks before death, the sensitivity and specificity was found to be 85 and 60 percent for sputum culture and 71 and 57 percent for BAL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In a prospective study of 232 ICU patients who died with pneumonia and underwent autopsy, none of 77 patients with <em>Candida</em> spp isolated from a tracheal aspirate or BAL fluid had histopathologic evidence of <em>Candida</em> pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Similarly, in a study of 1077 BAL specimens obtained from 555 mechanically ventilated patients in an intensive care unit, only 8 percent yielded <em>Candida</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-abdomen-and-thorax/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The overall mortality rate was 73 percent, in part because most patients had severe underlying illnesses. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that compromised immunity, lack of antifungal therapy, and respiratory failure were significantly associated with the risk of death. Systemic administration of all available antifungal agents most likely results in appropriate levels in the pleural fluid, but data in this area are scarce.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most appropriate initial agent is an echinocandin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a> 100 mg intravenously [IV] daily; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anidulafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anidulafungin</a> 200 mg loading dose, then 100 mg IV daily; or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caspofungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caspofungin</a> 70 mg loading dose, then 50 mg IV daily). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> (800 mg [12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> loading dose, then 400 mg [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> daily) can be used if the organism is susceptible.</p><p>For <em>C. glabrata</em>, after a week or two of therapy with an echinocandin, therapy can be changed to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> (400 mg twice daily for two doses, then 200 mg twice daily) if the organism is shown to be susceptible.

Discrete abscesses with or without peritonitis can occur. <em>Candida</em> peritonitis can also complicate continuous peritoneal dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other intraabdominal manifestations of <em>Candida</em> infection include isolated pancreatic abscess, gangrenous cholecystitis, and obstruction of the common bile duct with a <em>Candida</em> fungus ball. <em>C. albicans</em> is the predominant species isolated in intraabdominal candidal infections, but <em>C. glabrata</em> has assumed an increasing role at some centers. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Peritonitis and intraabdominal infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth of <em>Candida</em> species from an abscess or peritoneal fluid should lead to the diagnosis of invasive intraabdominal candidiasis and to appropriate treatment with an antifungal agent. Culture of <em>Candida</em> species from an indwelling drain is not adequate for the diagnosis of infection because it often reflects only colonization of the drain. The serum beta-D-glucan assay can be a useful adjunct to cultures of an abscess or peritoneal fluid and often becomes positive before the diagnosis is established by culture. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Peritonitis and intraabdominal infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of intraabdominal candidiasis usually entails both surgical intervention and antifungal therapy. The choice of agent depends upon the <em>Candida </em>species. Surgical management involves drainage of abscesses and relief of biliary tract obstruction. An echinocandin is recommended, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> is an alternative for fluconazole-susceptible isolates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87676 \">table 1</a>). A lipid formulation of amphotericin B is another alternative, but it is used infrequently because of the greater toxicity of this agent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary pneumonia due to <em>Candida</em> species is extremely rare. The pathogenesis of lung involvement is that of hematogenous spread rather than aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. Thus, multiple microabscesses are found scattered widely throughout the lung parenchyma, and lobar infiltrates are uncommon. Treatment is not recommended for <em>Candida</em> isolated from sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Patients with disseminated candidiasis who develop secondary <em>Candida</em> pneumonia should be treated for disseminated disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Candida</em> empyema occurs most commonly in individuals with underlying conditions, such as malignancy, and in hospitalized patients. The most appropriate initial agent is an echinocandin. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Empyema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Candida</em> mediastinitis almost always occurs after thoracic surgery procedures. Mediastinal drainage with debridement of affected bone in combination with antifungal therapy is essential for cure. The choice of agent should be similar to that recommended for candidemia. An echinocandin is the preferred initial agent. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> is an alternative if the isolate is susceptible. A lipid formulation of amphotericin B is a less frequently used alternative. Therapy is prolonged in most cases and only stopped when all clinical and laboratory signs of infection have resolved. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Mediastinitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purulent pericarditis due to <em>Candida</em> species is rare but life threatening. It most often arises as a complication of previous thoracic surgery or contiguous spread from an adjacent focus, but hematogenous spread can occur. An echinocandin is the preferred initial agent. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> is an alternative for fluconazole-susceptible isolates.
