The strength and integrity of fetal membranes derive from extracellular membrane proteins, including collagens, fibronectin, and laminin. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) decrease membrane strength by increasing collagen degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMMPs) bind to MMPs and inhibit MMP-associated proteolysis, thereby helping to maintain membrane integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A variety of pathologic events (eg, subclinical or overt infection, inflammation, mechanical stress, bleeding) can disrupt this and other homeostatic processes and initiate a cascade of biochemical changes that culminate in PROM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although the pathway varies depending on the initiating event, it is likely that all pathways lead to a final common pathway ending in membrane rupture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450397416\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450395235\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal physiologic, genetic, and environmental factors likely predispose to development of PPROM in many cases. These risk factors are similar to those for preterm labor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68992 \">table 1</a>), but most patients have no identifiable risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A history of PPROM in a previous pregnancy, genital tract infection, antepartum bleeding, and cigarette smoking have a particularly strong association with PPROM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Previous PPROM</strong> &ndash; Studies have consistently reported that a history of PPROM is a strong risk factor for recurrence. As an example, the Preterm Prediction Study, a large prospective study conducted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network, observed that women with a history of PPROM leading to preterm delivery had a 13.5 percent rate of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy compared with a 4.1 percent risk of PPROM and preterm birth in women with no such history (relative risk [RR] 3.3, 95% CI 2.1-5.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Moreover, in the subsequent pregnancy, women with a history of PPROM leading to preterm delivery were at high risk of PPROM and preterm birth before 28 weeks (1.8 versus 0.13 percent in women with no history of preterm birth due to PPROM; RR 13.5, 95% CI 23.0-80.3). Others have reported recurrence rates as high as 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genital tract infection</strong> &ndash; Genital tract infection is the single most common identifiable risk factor for PPROM. Three lines of epidemiologic evidence strongly support this association: (1) women with PPROM are significantly more likely than women with intact membranes to have pathogenic microorganisms in the amniotic fluid, (2) women with PPROM have a significantly higher rate of histologic chorioamnionitis than those who deliver preterm without PPROM, and (3) the frequency of PPROM is significantly higher in women with certain lower genital tract infections (particularly bacterial vaginosis) than in uninfected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial vaginosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The association between bacterial colonization of the lower genital tract and PPROM is not surprising. Many of the microorganisms that colonize the lower genital tract have the capacity to produce phospholipases, which can stimulate the production of prostaglandins and thereby lead to the onset of uterine contractions. In addition, the host's immune response to bacterial invasion of the endocervix <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal membranes leads to the production of multiple inflammatory mediators that can cause localized weakening of the fetal membranes and result in PPROM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Genetic regulation of the host's immune and inflammatory response appears to play a role in susceptibility and response to infections associated with PPROM.

Antepartum bleeding in more than one trimester increases the risk of PPROM three- to sevenfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/6,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cigarette smoking</strong> &ndash; The risk of PPROM among smokers is increased two- to fourfold compared with nonsmokers. The risk persists even after adjustment for other known risk factors for PPROM, including infection.

However, many women describe intermittent or constant leaking of small amounts of fluid or just a sensation of wetness within the vagina or on the perineum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450397591\"><span class=\"h2\">Findings on physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct observation of amniotic fluid coming out of the cervical canal or pooling in the vaginal fornix is pathognomonic of PPROM. If amniotic fluid is not immediately visible, the woman can be asked to push on her fundus, Valsalva, or cough to provoke leakage of amniotic fluid from the cervical os. </p><p>For patients who are not in active labor, examination of the cervix and vagina should be performed using a sterile speculum. Digital examination should be avoided because it may decrease the latency period (ie, time from rupture of membranes to delivery) and increase the risk of intrauterine infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The cervix may appear dilated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> effaced and, rarely, prolapse of a fetal part or the umbilical cord may be detected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450397685\"><span class=\"h2\">Findings on ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fifty to 70 percent of women with PPROM have low amniotic fluid volume on initial sonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Oligohydramnios can be defined as the absence of a single pocket of amniotic fluid that is &gt;2 cm in depth or an amniotic fluid index &le;5 cm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-amniotic-fluid-volume#H315613572\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of amniotic fluid volume&quot;, section on 'Semi-quantitative methods'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of pregnancies with PPROM deliver within one week of membrane rupture. In a randomized trial of PPROM at 24 to 32 weeks, the median time to delivery of 239 group B streptococcal (GBS)-negative patients managed expectantly with prophylactic antibiotics was 6.1 days; the cumulative delivery rate was 27 percent within 48 hours, 56 percent within 7 days, 76 percent within 14 days, and 86 percent within 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the duration of the latency period inversely correlates with gestational age at membrane rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Cessation of fluid leakage is rare, except in women with PPROM related to amniocentesis.

Prematurity-related morbidity varies with gestational age and is higher in the setting of chorioamnionitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Fetal exposure to intrauterine inflammation has been associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment.

Endometritis is more common after cesarean than vaginal delivery. The incidence of infection is higher at earlier gestational ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Placental abruption occurs in 2 to 5 percent of pregnancies complicated by PPROM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. The risk is increased seven- to ninefold in PPROM pregnancies in which intrauterine infection or oligohydramnios is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Placental abruption may be the precipitating event for, or a consequence of, PPROM.

The risk of cord prolapse is especially high (11 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]) in the setting of both nonvertex fetal presentation and PPROM. Non-cephalic presentation may also increase the risk of abruption, infection, and fetal death in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Such complications are most likely when membrane rupture occurs at less than 23 weeks of gestation.

Laboratory tests can be used to confirm the clinical diagnosis when it is uncertain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450398268\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory confirmation of clinically suspected PPROM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450398543\"><span class=\"h3\">Nitrazine and fern tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If PPROM is not obvious after visual inspection, the diagnosis can be confirmed by testing the pH of the vaginal fluid, which is easily accomplished with Nitrazine paper. Amniotic fluid usually has a pH range of 7.0 to 7.3 compared with the normally acidic vaginal pH of 3.8 to 4.2 and the normal acidic pH of urine of 5.0 to 6.0. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56755\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56755 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>False-negative and false-positive Nitrazine test results occur in up to 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. False-negative test results can occur when leaking is intermittent or the amniotic fluid is diluted by other vaginal fluids. False-positive results can be due to the presence of alkaline fluids in the vagina, such as blood, seminal fluid, or soap. In addition, the pH of urine can be elevated to near 8.0 if infected with <em>Proteus</em> species.</p><p>A second confirmatory test is the presence of arborization (ferning). Fluid from the posterior vaginal fornix is swabbed onto a glass slide and allowed to dry for at least 10 minutes. Amniotic fluid produces a delicate ferning pattern, in contrast to the thick and wide arborization pattern of dried cervical mucus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78666\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78666 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61431\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61431 \">picture 3</a>). Well-estrogenized cervical mucus or a fingerprint on the microscope slide may cause a false-positive fern test; false negatives can be due to inadequate amniotic fluid on the swab or heavy contamination with vaginal discharge or blood.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, an absorbent pad (AmnioSense) that changes color at pH &gt;5.2 is used as a panty liner and marketed to pregnant women. In a study of 157 pregnant women, the sensitivity and specificity of this device for diagnosis of membrane rupture were 98 and 65 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H512513879\"><span class=\"h3\">Commercial tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several tests for diagnosis of rupture of membranes are now commercially available. A 2013 meta-analysis of prospective observational or cohort studies investigating insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1 [Actim PROM]) and placental alpha microglobulin-1 protein assay (PAMG-1&nbsp;[AmniSure]) for diagnosis of rupture of membranes concluded PAMG-1 (AmniSure) was more accurate than IGFBP-1 (Actim PROM)&nbsp;for diagnosis of rupture of membranes in all patient populations (eg, known rupture status, uncertain rupture status) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>These tests are not widely used in the United States because of their cost and the complexities of credentialing providers and maintaining quality control. Although these tests were originally intended for point-of-care bedside use, some of these issues can be avoided by sending the specimen to the hospital laboratory so that qualified laboratory personnel perform the test. The author would consider using one of the commercial tests described below <strong>only</strong> in cases where the diagnosis of PPROM is problematic, such as when the patient's history is somewhat suggestive, but no pooling is evident and ultrasound shows low-normal amniotic fluid volume. He would base the choice of test on expense and the ease of performance in an individual hospital laboratory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450398290\"><span class=\"h4\">PAMG-1 (AmniSure)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AmniSure is a rapid slide test that uses immunochromatography methods to detect trace amounts of placental alpha microglobulin-1 protein in vaginal fluid. Placental alpha microglobulin-1 is released from decidual cells. An advantage of this test is that it is not affected by semen or trace amounts of blood.</p><p>The test is designed to be performed by the provider at the point of care using a commercially available kit. A sterile swab is inserted into the vagina for one minute, then placed into a vial containing a solvent for one minute, and then an AmniSure test strip is dipped into the vial. The test result is revealed by the presence of one or two lines within the next 5 to 10 minutes (one visible line means a negative result for amniotic fluid, two visible lines is a positive result, and no visible lines is an invalid result). In large studies, sensitivity ranged from 94.4 to 98.9 percent and specificity ranged from 87.5 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>].

This protein is secreted by decidual and placental cells and has a very high concentration in amniotic fluid compared to other body fluids. An easy-to-use, immunochromatography dipstick method (eg, Actim Prom) is available in some countries for use at the bedside to detect IGFBP-1 in vaginal secretions. This test is popular in Europe but is not widely used in the United States. A positive test is denoted by the presence of two blue lines on the dipstick. The test is not affected by the presence of infected vaginal secretions, urine, semen, or small amounts of blood. </p><p>The test is most accurate when applied as soon as possible after rupture of membranes. Sensitivity in detecting ruptured membranes ranges from 95 to 100 percent, specificity ranges from 93 to 98 percent, and positive predictive value approaches 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/37,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39-42</a>].

Screening for group B <em>Streptococcus</em>, sexually transmitted infections, and possibly bacterial vaginosis (BV) is useful for guiding antibiotic therapy (discussed below), but vaginal culture is not helpful since the vaginal flora is normally polymicrobial. Screening for BV using Amsel criteria is problematic when amniotic fluid is in the vagina; a positive Gram stain is predictive of BV, but has low sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>The key decision is whether to induce labor (or perform cesarean delivery) or to manage the pregnancy expectantly.

The immature fetus will benefit by prolongation of pregnancy that results in a significant reduction in gestational age-related morbidity, but this benefit needs to be balanced with the risks of PPROM-associated complications and their sequelae in expectantly managed pregnancies: intrauterine infection, placental abruption, cord <span class=\"nowrap\">prolapse/compression</span>. </p><p>Expeditious delivery of women with PPROM is generally clinically appropriate in the setting of intrauterine infection, abruptio placentae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], or nonreassuring fetal testing, particularly after 32 weeks of gestation. In each of these conditions, fetal well-being can deteriorate rapidly with expectant management, and there are no therapeutic interventions available other than delivery. For the same reason, an unstable lie with a high risk of cord prolapse is an indication for delivery rather than expectant management, but the balance between the risks of cord prolapse and birth of a very or extremely preterm birth also needs to be considered on a case by case basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intra-amniotic-infection-clinical-chorioamnionitis-or-triple-i\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intra-amniotic infection (clinical chorioamnionitis or triple I)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=umbilical-cord-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Umbilical cord prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of complications, patients are monitored closely and managed expectantly before 34 weeks of gestation.

The rationale for antibiotic prophylaxis is that infection appears to be both a cause and consequence of PPROM.

The goal of antibiotic therapy is to reduce the frequency of maternal and fetal infection and thereby delay the onset of preterm labor (ie, prolong latency) and the need for indicated preterm delivery. The importance of reducing infection is underscored by studies suggesting a relationship between chorioamnionitis, duration of membrane rupture, and development of cerebral palsy or neurodevelopmental impairment.

Second, the trials in the meta-analyses were conducted over extended periods of time (up to nine years) , and major changes occurred in both obstetric and neonatal management during this time period (notably the decreased use of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in favor of continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]). Third, there was no uniformity in the way that corticosteroids, tocolytics, and prophylactic antibiotics were administered (given according to local protocols). Fourth, there were significant differences between trials in the interval between PROM and induction of labor in the early delivery groups. Fifth, the trials were conducted in multiple different patient populations, not all of which are similar to patients treated in the United States, and at many different facilities with different levels of resources and different management strategies. Sixth, some of the patients were treated as outpatients, a practice which is not the standard of the care in the United States. Finally, and perhaps of greatest importance with respect to practice in the United States, none of the trials addressed the issue of the comparative costs of the two management options. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2594661903\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Magnesium sulfate</a> is administered prior to delivery according to standard clinical protocols for fetal neuroprotection (eg, pregnancies at least 24 but &lt;32 weeks of gestation at risk of imminent delivery).
