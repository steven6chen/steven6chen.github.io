In addition to physical effects (eg, skin injury, secondary infections, scarring, and loss of sleep), pruritus can contribute to emotional disturbances such as agitation and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In severe cases, pruritus can be incapacitating.</p><p>The inciting factor for pruritus and the extent and severity of symptoms influence the approach to treatment. While in some patients amelioration of pruritus is easily attained, treatment is extremely challenging in other individuals.</p><p>A wide variety of therapies have been used for pruritus; however, data are limited on the efficacy of many treatment options (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50432%7EDERM%2F63221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50432 graphicRef63221 \">table 1A-B</a>). The therapies used for pruritus and the approach to the management of pruritus will be discussed here. Inciting factors for pruritus and the evaluation of patients with pruritus are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-etiology-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Etiology and patient evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8354354\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies may be beneficial in the treatment of pruritus. Topical therapies are commonly used for localized forms of pruritus; systemic agents are typically needed for patients with generalized symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H8354368\" class=\"local\">'Local pharmacologic therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8354410\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8354361\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The elimination of aggravating factors for pruritus is an important component of symptom management. Interventions that may be beneficial include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin moisturization </strong>&ndash; Dry skin can cause or exacerbate pruritus; thus, all patients with generalized symptoms should be educated on proper skin care. For example, gentle cleansers should be used during bathing and patients should apply emollients to the skin daily. (See <a href=\"#H8354494\" class=\"local\">'Xerosis (dry skin)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cool environment </strong>&ndash; Symptoms of pruritus may be exacerbated by exposure to heat. Light-weight clothing, air-conditioned environments, and the use of lukewarm (rather than hot) water during showers or baths may reduce symptoms. Lotions that provide a cooling sensation on the skin, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calamine-lotion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calamine lotion</a> or lotions with up to a 4% concentration of menthol (eg, Sarna or Men-Phor) can provide additional relief.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of skin irritants </strong>&ndash; Direct contact with substances that may irritate the skin, such as wool clothing and cleansing products, should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stress reduction </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Stress and other psychogenic factors may induce or aggravate chronic itch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>], and stress reduction may help to reduce symptoms. In addition, psychological support and education on pruritus and behavioral interventions that minimize symptoms may help patients to cope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Holistic approaches such as meditation, acupuncture, and yoga may be useful as adjunctive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical interventions </strong>&ndash; Scratching may increase symptoms of pruritus, resulting in a perpetual itch-scratch cycle. Occlusion of localized areas of pruritus with Unna boots or other occlusive dressings (eg, DuoDerm) may help to break this cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Keeping fingernails trimmed to a short length may also help to minimize skin damage induced from scratching.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8354368\"><span class=\"h2\">Local pharmacologic therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical therapy is most useful for patients with localized forms of pruritus, such as limited dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. A table that summarizes the options for local therapy is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50432\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50432 \">table 1A</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8354375\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical and intralesional corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids are effective for the treatment of inflammatory skin disease, which often results in the concomitant relief of the associated pruritus. These agents are <strong>not</strong> indicated for pruritus without evidence of skin inflammation.</p><p>Wet wraps, which involve the application of low to medium potency topical corticosteroids under moist dressings, are sometimes used in patients with atopic dermatitis or other inflammatory pruritic dermatoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. For thick or nodular lesions, intralesional injection of corticosteroids may be more effective than topical agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Controlling pruritus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Potential adverse effects of topical corticosteroids include cutaneous atrophy and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis. The side effects of topical corticosteroids are reviewed in greater detail elsewhere.

The mechanism of action for capsaicin involves its ability to activate transient release potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), an ion channel in cutaneous nerve fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Activation of TRPV1 stimulates neurons to release and eventually deplete certain neuropeptides, including substance P. Capsaicin also induces lasting desensitization of neurons to a variety of stimuli. In sum, these effects lead to the inhibition of neuronal transmission of pain and pruritus.</p><p>Although a systematic review or randomized trials found insufficient evidence for definitive conclusions on the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> for pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], multiple studies have documented the efficacy of this agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Neuropathic disorders such as notalgia paresthetica and brachioradial pruritus appear to be particularly responsive to this therapy. Prurigo nodularis, aquagenic pruritus, and pruritus associated with chronic renal disease are examples of other disorders that have been successfully treated with capsaicin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/11,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8354515\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral neuropathic itch'</a> below.)</p><p>The acute stimulation of neuropeptide release that occurs early in the course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> therapy manifests as a transient, intense burning sensation that occurs immediately after application and lasts for up to 30 minutes. This adverse effect may contribute to poor compliance and premature treatment cessation, and patients should be informed that these symptoms usually resolve after two to three weeks of use. A topical anesthetic, such as eutectic mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 2.5% and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a> 2.5% cream (EMLA) or a 5% lidocaine patch applied 30 to 60 minutes prior to treatment may minimize the burning sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8354389\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical calcineurin inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical calcineurin inhibitors are used for the treatment of multiple inflammatory skin diseases.

In addition to the suppression of cutaneous inflammation, phosphorylation of TRPV1 has been proposed as another mechanism through which topical calcineurin inhibitors reduce pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Adverse effects of topical calcineurin inhibitors include a burning sensation after application, which may be a result of initial release of substance P, as has been described with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although concern has been raised over the possibility of an increased risk for malignancy with the use of these agents, the risk for malignancy appears to be low.

Antihistamines and topical corticosteroids are ineffective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8354543\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pruritus is a common symptom that can be incapacitating in severe cases. A wide variety of therapies have been utilized for management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50432%7EDERM%2F63221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50432 graphicRef63221 \">table 1A-B</a>); however, data are limited on the efficacy of most treatments. (See <a href=\"#H8354354\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial step in the management of patients with pruritus is the identification of the inciting cause. In some cases, treatment of the underlying disorder results in the resolution of pruritus. However, in idiopathic or chronic disease, treatment is often challenging. (See <a href=\"#H8354480\" class=\"local\">'Approach to specific types of pruritus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal pruritus can often be managed with local therapies, such as topical corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical anesthetics, and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>. Topical corticosteroids should only be used for patients with inflammatory dermatoses. (See <a href=\"#H8354368\" class=\"local\">'Local pharmacologic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measures to minimize skin dryness and irritation are important components of the management of all patients with generalized pruritus. Skin should be gently cleansed and frequently moisturized. Irritating environmental factors should be avoided. Stress reduction may also be useful. (See <a href=\"#H8354361\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with generalized pruritus that is not relieved by nonpharmacologic interventions often require systemic agents for symptom control. The efficacy of oral antihistamines for pruritus in disorders other than urticaria and mastocytosis is uncertain. However, the relative safety, low cost, and wide availability of these agents make them reasonable choices for first-line therapy. The soporific effects of sedating first generation antihistamines may be of particular benefit in patient with nocturnal pruritus. (See <a href=\"#H8354410\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agents that act through effects on the central nervous system are additional options for the treatment of pruritus. Modulators of opioid receptors, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aprepitant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aprepitant</a> have been used successfully. (See <a href=\"#H8354410\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapies'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">van Os-Medendorp H, Ros WJ, Eland-de Kok PC, et al.
