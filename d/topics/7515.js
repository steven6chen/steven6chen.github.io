Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is the term used to describe amenorrhea that results from such causes and is diagnosed after ruling out other etiologies of amenorrhea. The terms functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) are often used interchangeably.</p><p>This topic will review the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of FHA. The diagnosis and management of FHA, as well as the overall approach to the woman with primary and secondary amenorrhea, is presented separately.

Risk factors for FHA include eating disorders (in particular anorexia nervosa [AN]), excessive exercise, and stress. FHA is responsible for approximately 25 to 35 percent and 3 percent of secondary and primary amenorrhea cases, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Low-weight eating disorders are reported in 0.2 to 4 percent of adolescents and young adult women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although amenorrhea is no longer a diagnostic criterion for AN per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], FHA is commonly seen in this condition.

Most obtain health benefits, but some can also develop menstrual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, excessive exercise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequate caloric intake leading to relative energy deficiency at a critical time in development may delay puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Emotional stress is also associated with FHA and has been considered both a cause and effect of the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In female athletes, the combination of low energy availability, subsequent hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis inhibition resulting in menstrual dysfunction, and low bone density is called the &quot;female athlete triad&quot; (Triad) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

There are also multiple neural stimulatory and inhibitory signals that affect GnRH secretion, often via the hypothalamic neuropeptide, kisspeptin, encoded by <em>KISS1</em>. <em>KISS1</em> neurons contact GnRH neurons directly and are critical for the induction of puberty and the maintenance of fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

But low body weight alone is not sufficient to explain the onset of amenorrhea, because women with similar body mass indexes (BMIs) vary in their menstrual response to exercise.
