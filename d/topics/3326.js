The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of lead poisoning are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children are exposed to lead in a variety of ways. Despite the removal of lead from gasoline and paint in the late 1970s, ingestion of chips and dust from the continued presence of lead paint remains the primary source of lead poisoning in children. In addition, contaminated soil from gasoline emissions continues as an important source. Other important pediatric exposures include elevated maternal blood lead levels (BLLs) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, food, or water contamination and excess lead in parental occupations, toys, cosmetics, and <span class=\"nowrap\">herbal/ayurvedic</span> remedies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lead exposure during fetal development may result from mobilization of bone lead stored from past exposure into the maternal bloodstream <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> from direct elevation of maternal BLLs caused by acute or chronic environmental lead exposure during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In utero lead exposure is associated with impairment of postnatal neurodevelopment with an increased risk for developmental delay, lowering of IQ, and behavioral abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In the United States, blood lead screening is recommended for pregnant women with important risk factors for lead exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F86038\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86038 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment#H2913880893\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;, section on 'Lead level'</a>.)</p><p>A maternal BLL over 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> is a marker of significant exposure to lead above background levels for pregnant women in the United States population. Because lead crosses the placenta readily and a toxicologic threshold for adverse effects to the fetus or newborn has <strong>not</strong> been identified, maternal BLLs elevated above background warrant follow-up testing in the mother during and after pregnancy and in the newborn infant. Providers for pregnant women with elevated BLLs should ensure that the maternal lead level is known by the provider managing the newborn infant. Levels of both the mother and infants should be documented in both of their medical records.&nbsp;(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-occupational-lead-poisoning#H1887834063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adult occupational lead poisoning&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy and breastfeeding'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-management#H2587941996\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Management&quot;, section on 'Prenatal exposure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ingestion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ingestion of lead-containing dust is the primary source of lead exposure in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The major sources of lead dust are oxidation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mechanical disruption of lead-containing paint and soil. In addition, lead dust may be carried into the child's environment on the clothing or skin of adults who have hobbies or occupations that expose them to lead (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53953 \">table 2</a>) or who live in households that have been inadequately decontaminated. Additionally, other sources of lead in children include toys, cosmetics and <span class=\"nowrap\">herbal/ayurvedic</span> remedies often from sources outside of the United States.</p><p>The normal progression of developmental skills and the behavior of young children places them at risk for lead ingestion in lead-containing environments. Young children spend much of their time on the floor as they learn to crawl and then to walk; during this time, their hands often are in direct contact with lead-contaminated dust or soil. Young children also have normal hand-to-mouth and mouthing behaviors, especially when they are teething (between 6 and 24 months), that increase the likelihood of ingesting lead-containing paint, dust, or soil.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Paint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the early 1900 publication of the significant toxicity of lead, lead-based paint has continued as the major source of lead exposure for children in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Before 1955, the lead content of white house paint was as high as 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After 1955, the lead content of paint was reduced, but lead was not eliminated until 1978, when the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) restricted lead content to 0.06 percent for any paint intended to be used on residential surfaces, toys, or furniture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Despite the elimination of lead from newly manufactured paint, paint that was applied to homes before 1978 remains in place. A United States housing survey performed from 2005 to 2006 found that over 3 million homes with children under six years of age had lead-based paint hazards with over a third residing in low-income households [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>A review of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) determined that children who live in or regularly visit a home or daycare center built before 1950 are at risk for lead exposure and should be tested for lead intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The lead content of dust in homes is typically highest in window wells and windowsills because of the mechanical disruption that occurs with raising and lowering the windows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Soil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before lead was removed from petroleum products in the United States, automobile exhaust emitted millions of pounds of lead into the environment each month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13,14</a>]. The elimination of lead from gasoline was a successful nationwide primary prevention measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Between 1976 and 1989, the amount of lead consumed in gasoline in the United States decreased by 50 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60319\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60319 \">figure 1</a>), and BLL decreased by 37 percent.</p><p>The European Union banned leaded gasoline in 2000. The World Bank and the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development called for worldwide elimination of lead from petroleum products in 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and worldwide elimination is almost complete.</p><p>Contamination of the soil surrounding residential areas can be an important source of lead dust inside the home as well as for the child who plays outdoors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Soil contamination typically is restricted to 2 to 5 cm below the surface if the soil is undisturbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Soil contamination may be increased in homes at which car repair activities are performed in the home or yard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, soil that is brought in for raised garden beds may contain lead and should be tested prior to its use. The accepted safety standard for lead in bare soil is &lt;400 parts per million (ppm) for play areas, and &lt;1200 ppm for nonplay areas. Information about testing soil for lead can be obtained from the <a href=\"http://epa.gov/lead/pubs/nlic.htm&amp;token=hOENbDSzTOyjv1vzeAyE/m6hAeT/nDxBdzcGpQswemd7+lGiIM6w50CLpFhcgSAM&amp;TOPIC_ID=6493\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Lead Information Center</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Water</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lead in drinking water probably is absorbed more completely than lead in food and may account for more than 50 percent of the lead that is ingested by infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Municipal water supplies are controlled and regulated to prevent contamination at the source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], although these precautions sometimes fail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, once the water reaches the home, it is rarely regulated, tested, or treated. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action level for lead in water is 15 parts per billion (ppb) although this is not a health-based standard but one that is based upon old data for the feasibility of water companies to achieve the level. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that this number should be much lower and recommends 1 ppb in schools. The EPA is in the process of reviewing and revising the Lead and Copper Rule and will most likely decrease the current standard.</p><p>Most lead contamination of household water is caused by copper plumbing that is joined with lead solder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Lead pipes may contribute to lead contamination, but lead plumbing usually is old enough to have its inner surface coated with mineral deposits, which prevent leaching of lead into the water supply. However, disruption of the pipes or first use of water that has been standing in the system can result in higher levels of lead in the water. Recommendations include running cold water for 5 minutes prior to first use in the morning before consumption. However, adherence to this recommendation is likely low in practice.</p><p>Other potential sources for lead contamination include storage cisterns, sources of water that are outside the municipal water districts, and aging water coolers or water heaters, particularly in areas where the water has a relatively low pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Acidity and elevated temperature increase the ability of the water to leach lead from the solder or pipes, as does standing in the pipes for extended periods of time (eg, overnight).</p><p>Additional information about lead in drinking water is available on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's <a href=\"http://water.epa.gov/drink/info/lead/index.cfm&amp;token=TBjD2ZlbdvrjcJ8xGFYHGPu73j4c7Y/SZsHUXDjWQOMtB4dzEffCVcmbQFIqSHWfx+DcFv7bOMRu9LCgC4AysQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6493\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Food</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful dietary history in children with lead poisoning may help to identify dietary sources of lead exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/9,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,25,26</a>]. Although rare, food can be contaminated with lead during production, processing, packaging, preparation, or storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Produce that is grown in lead-containing soil or exposed to exhaust from vehicles that use lead-containing fuel can be contaminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/4,5,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,19,21</a>]. Although lead has been banned from petroleum products in the United States, the soil along certain major transportation routes and in inner city cooperative gardens may still be contaminated with significant amounts of lead. Lead-based petroleum products continue to be used in many developing agricultural countries from which food is imported.</p><p>Canned food can become contaminated with lead if lead solder is used in the canning process. The lead is leached into the food during oxidation, which begins to occur once the can is opened, particularly if the food is acidic. However, lead was banned from use, including imported products, in 1995.</p><p>Food may be contaminated during preparation by the addition of lead-contaminated spices (purchased in other countries and not tested for purity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Food also may be contaminated with lead if it is stored, prepared, or served in lead-glazed pottery, leaded-crystal glassware, lead-containing cooking vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], or plastic bags decorated with red or yellow lead-containing pigments (eg, bread bags) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/5,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29,30</a>]. Lastly, boiling water to reduce infectious agents may concentrate the lead in water and increase the risk for poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11089643\"><span class=\"h4\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levels of lead in breast milk are up to 3 percent of BLLs in the mother and are directly correlated with maternal blood lead concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Based upon estimates of infant blood level elevation occurring from breast milk ingestion, breastfeeding should be encouraged for all mothers with a venous BLL &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58503 \">table 3</a>). In the United States, infants whose mothers have a BLL &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> should not breastfeed initially. The mother should be instructed to pump her breast milk and discard it. Breastfeeding should be instituted if the maternal BLL falls below 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span>. </p><p>Whether the risks of breastfeeding, for mothers with a BLL &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> who live in a developing country, outweigh the benefits is uncertain. Continuation of breastfeeding is based upon whether there is evidence that breast milk is contributing to infant lead levels on the follow-up maternal and infant screening.

However, chronic exposure from these objects may also result in lead exposures from ingestion of lead dust. Children with sensory disorders are especially at risk if they chronically use these objects for calming purposes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhalation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalational exposures to lead can cause elevated lead levels due to direct contact by small particles with lung capillaries and from ingestion at the same time. The exposure of children in the United States to lead via inhalation decreased after the elimination of lead from automobile gasoline products in 1978. However, children who live near industrial plants where lead is used, smelted, or mined, and children who live in countries that have not banned lead from petroleum products may continue to be exposed by this route. Children also may be exposed to lead through inhalation during home renovation or if they or their parents engage in hobbies that involve the use, melting, or spraying of lead-containing products (ie, target shooting at indoor firing ranges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53953 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/6,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34,35</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Children's products and toys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children's products and toys provide another potential route for lead exposure.

The risk of lead poisoning from these products is low unless there is significant mouthing, chewing, or swallowing by children or the product is damaged or deteriorating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 reduces the permissible lead content of toys and children's products from 0.06 percent (600 ppm) lead by weight to 0.03 percent (300 ppm) by 2009, and &le;0.01 percent (100 ppm) by 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The CPSIA also requires third party testing of children's products to ensure compliance with the safety standards and to the extent possible, the placement of permanent tracking labels.</p><p>The CPSC standard applies to toy jewelry, but not to costume jewelry, which is often given to children.</p><p>While this standard applies to all children&rsquo;s products, every product that is imported from another country cannot be tested for the presence of lead.

Kohl, an ancient eye make-up that is commonly applied to children from the Middle East, Asia, or Africa, may contain lead. Pottery from Mexico or other countries can leach lead from the ceramic especially when used to store acidic liquids, such as orange juice. Lastly, ethnic remedies purchased from outside of the United States may contain lead and result in significant poisoning. These should be assessed during a home investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial athletic fields</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artificial turf playing fields made of nylon or <span class=\"nowrap\">nylon/polyethylene</span> blend fibers may contain unhealthy levels of lead dust [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. With wear, frequent use, and weathering, the nylon fibers break down into dust that may be ingested or inhaled. This potential exposure route has not resulted in any reports of elevated BLLs in children. However, a formal assessment of the risk of exposure to lead and other contaminants during play on artificial turf is ongoing. We support a moratorium on the use of these products pending the results.

However, the efficacy of aggressive environmental remediation largely is unproven, the methods are controversial, and the costs are high. It is known that household educational interventions such as dust control and soil abatement may not be effective in reducing BLLs as a population health measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition, no studies have reported on cognitive gains with remediation. That said, the evaluation of remediation is done after the child has already been exposed, whereas remediation is more likely to be beneficial before the exposure. Nonetheless, complete removal of lead from the child's environment is considered to be the only effective preventive measure and treatment for reducing the lead body burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Family education regarding methods to decrease exposure and absorption is recommended for all children with childhood lead poisoning.

The age of the home is important in determining the risk of exposure, particularly for homes built before 1950. Unfortunately, parental awareness of the age of the home may be inaccurate. In a survey where parents' answers about the age of their home were compared with information in tax assessor records, only 52 percent of those living in housing built before 1950 accurately identified their home as such [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Well-designed studies are difficult to perform because the expense of lead abatement prohibits a study large enough to document a clear benefit. However, treatment of elevated BLLs in children should focus on the removal of the source of lead exposure, as studies have shown that lead levels decrease significantly when the source is ameliorated.

Information was gathered before, within 6 weeks of, and 6 to 12 months after the intervention; 2682 dwellings were treated and had final results. Additional data were collected two and three years after the intervention for approximately 40 percent of the dwellings. Interior intervention strategies ranged from cleaning and spot painting to full lead removal. The exterior building was treated in 70 percent of dwellings (eg, paint stabilization, paint removal). Soil or site work (eg, application of <span class=\"nowrap\">mulch/seed/sod/plants,</span> soil removal, structure removal) was conducted at 13 percent of dwellings. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lead hazard control activities reduced the floor, window sill, and window trough dust lead levels compared with preintervention levels (by 78 percent, 89 percent, and 95 percent, respectively); reduced levels were maintained for at least three years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All interior strategies resulted in decreased average floor dust levels.

This remediation is considered temporary because over time, lead dust will reaccumulate because of further oxidation and mechanical disruption of the lead-based paint. Home restoration or remodeling of the home will re-expose the lead paint. Nonetheless, interim control strategies have resulted in decreased lead dust content and modest declines in the BLL of resident children 9 to 15 months after the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/11,55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,55-59</a>].

However, within three months of cleaning the levels returned to precleaning levels. Thus, families should learn the same techniques and utilize them regularly to reduce the lead hazards.

Certain measures can be taken to limit exposure of children to lead in homes that contain lead-based paint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68214\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68214 \">table 5</a>). These educational measures are often supplemented by dust control interventions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82254 \">table 7</a>). Although the use of high-phosphate detergents (eg, TSP) was recommended in the past, use of high-phosphate detergents is no longer recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>However, the benefits of lead exposure education and dust control measures are unclear. A meta-analysis of 14 studies (2643 children) did not show a significant impact on mean BLLs 6 to 18 months after initiation of household education, dust control measures, or both (mean difference in BLL between intervention and control groups 0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [0.001 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> higher in the intervention groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

However, lead-contaminated water continues to be a potential problem in homes built before 1988. Removal of the source of lead is the most reliable way to eliminate water-based exposure to lead. However, many home-owners do not know the type of pipes in their homes. In addition, water treatment facilities are required to test water for lead, but their jurisdiction ends at the sidewalk of the home.</p><p>The ability of home water filters or purifiers to remove lead depends upon the type of filter. Ion-exchange, reverse-osmosis filters, and distillation are effective in removing lead, but the most commonly available home filters (glass fiber and carbon) usually include packaging material that specifies that they do <strong>not</strong> efficiently remove heavy metals. However, some home carbon filters can remove lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Depending on the contaminant or the source of contaminant, point-of-entry or point-of-use devices may be used. Point-of-entry filters will not be effective in homes containing lead pipes.</p><p>Water to be used for cooking or drinking should come from the cold tap because hot water is more able to leach lead from the pipes. In addition, the water should be run for some time (eg, 3 to 5 minutes) before it is collected; this flushes the water that has a higher lead content (caused by standing in the pipes) down the drain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Food</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has established guidelines for the maximum lead content in processed and canned foods.
