Although the high prevalence of acne in the adolescent population has contributed to a perception that acne is a disorder of youth, acne remains a significant problem for many adults.</p><p>The unique features of postadolescent acne in women will be discussed here. General information on the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of acne is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal therapy for women with acne vulgaris&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-isotretinoin-therapy-for-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Light-based, adjunctive, and other therapies for acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475461221\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postadolescent acne is a common disorder that is often defined as acne that occurs in individuals aged 25 years or older. The disorder appears to occur more frequently in women than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. As an example, in a population-based study of more than 17,000 individuals in China, acne was more common in men prior to the age of 30, but was more prevalent in women thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similarly, in a community-based study of 749 adults aged 25 years or older in the United Kingdom, clinically significant acne (defined as Leeds acne grade &ge;1) was detected in 12 percent of women, but only 3 percent of men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>In addition, women may be more likely to visit healthcare providers for the evaluation and treatment of postadolescent acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. In a retrospective study performed in the United Kingdom, 152 out of 200 patients over the age of 25 who were referred to a dermatology department for acne were female (75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of acne in women steadily decreases with age. This was evident in a prospective study of 2895 women (aged 10 to 70 years) performed in the United States, England, Italy, and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although acne was most prevalent at age 16 (present in almost 70 percent of subjects) and proceeded to decline after the age of 18, approximately one-half of women in their 20s, one-quarter of women in their 30s, and more than 10 percent of women in their 40s still had clinically significant acne (defined as more than four inflammatory lesions or comedones present on one side of the face). Acne occurred less frequently in post-menopausal women; among women aged 51 years and older, clinically significant acne was detected in less than 5 percent.</p><p>Ethnicity may play a role in the risk for postadolescent acne in women. In the study population of 2895 women described above, clinically significant acne was slightly more prevalent in African-American and Hispanic females (37 and 32 percent, respectively), than in Continental Indian, Caucasian, or Asian women (23, 24, and 30 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159594937\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND ASSOCIATED FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to acne in other populations, multiple factors contribute to the development of acne lesions in women. The four local events in the skin that are linked to the formation of acne lesions are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excess sebum production </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal keratinization of the pilosebaceous follicles </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Cutibacterium</em> (formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>)<em> acnes</em> colonization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation</p><p/><p>Excess sebum production and abnormal follicular keratinization contribute to the formation of comedones, which are considered the primary lesions of acne. Rupture of the comedones and inflammatory reactions to <em>C. acnes</em>, an organism that feeds on sebum, are associated with the development of inflammatory lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328490228\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androgens, steroid hormones that promote male sexual characteristics, are believed to contribute to the development of acne in women. Androgens are capable of stimulating the growth of sebaceous glands in the skin and can augment sebum production, characteristics that may contribute to lesion formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A role for androgens in the development of acne in women is supported by the observation that endogenously- or exogenously-derived increases in serum androgen levels have been linked to the development of acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. In addition, acne in women often improves during treatment with anti-androgenic therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal therapy for women with acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common cause of endogenous hyperandrogenemia in women is polycystic ovarian syndrome; less common causes include late-onset adrenal hyperplasia, ovarian hyperthecosis, and virilizing ovarian or adrenal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Hyperandrogenemic states may also result from the administration of anabolic steroids or testosterone supplementation. In addition, progestin-only contraceptives that contain pro-androgenic progestins and lack anti-androgenic estrogens may contribute to the development of acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-clinical-presentation-of-nonclassic-late-onset-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and clinical presentation of nonclassic (late-onset) congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-hyperthecosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian hyperthecosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-hyperandrogenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenal hyperandrogenism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, most adult women with acne have normal androgen levels and do not receive exogenous androgens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. The relationship between circulating androgen levels and acne in these women is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>]. Proposed mechanisms through which androgens may contribute to acne in these patients include the effects of increased conversion of androgen precursors to androgens within the sebaceous glands and elevated sensitivity of sebaceous glands to androgens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328490221\"><span class=\"h2\">Menstrual cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 83 percent of women with acne note premenstrual flares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/3,5,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,24-27</a>]. In one series of 41 women between the ages of 18 and 44 with acne, 63 percent showed a premenstrual increase in the number of inflammatory lesions, and the number of inflammatory lesions present increased by 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Accumulation of sebum within the sebaceous glands due to a reduction in the size of the pilosebaceous orifice during the premenstrual period has been proposed as a potential contributor to premenstrual flares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. However, the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328490214\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have linked smoking to adult female acne, including one study that specifically linked smoking with the presence of noninflammatory acne lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Effects of nicotine on sebum production or keratinization have been proposed as potential contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Yet, other studies have found conflicting results, and the existence of a causative relationship remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328490420\"><span class=\"h2\">Cosmetic products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms acne cosmetica and pomade acne have been used to describe an association between the use of cosmetic skin or hair products and acne, a phenomenon that was attributed to follicular plugging induced by certain agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. This phenomenon may contribute to the insidious, slow development of comedones and, eventually, inflammatory lesions. In addition, follicular irritation related to the application of cosmetics may result in the rapid appearance of an eruption characterized by small inflammatory papules that closely resembles acne vulgaris (vellus hair folliculitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris#H21903168\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Acne cosmetica'</a> and <a href=\"#H328490555\" class=\"local\">'Cosmetic concerns and skin care'</a> below.)</p><p>The degree to which cosmetic use contributes to acne in the adult female population is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/5,22,23,27,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22,23,27,40</a>]. The methods used to test comedogenicity of products vary considerably across the cosmetic industry, and products that contain comedogenic ingredients are not necessarily comedogenic when applied to human skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition, individual responses to certain products may vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328491114\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other factors that may play a role in acne include stress, diet, and genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/23,26,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26,41</a>]. Data on risk factors specifically for postadolescent acne in women are limited. A case-control study of 248 women with acne and 270 controls found associations between adult female acne and a history of adolescent acne, family history of acne, no prior pregnancies, hirsutism, office work, high level of reported psychologic stress, and low weekly consumption of fruits, vegetables, or fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Additional studies are required to confirm these findings.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the pathogenesis of acne is included elsewhere.

In a prospective study of patients over the age of 25 who presented to a dermatology department in the United Kingdom for acne, only 28 of 152 women (18 percent) had late-onset acne (onset after the age of 25 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An international prospective study of 374 adult females (&ge;25 years of age) who presented to a dermatologist for the evaluation of acne found similar results; only 10 percent of women recalled the onset of acne after age 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>As with acne in adolescents, acne in adult women commonly presents with both noninflammatory acne lesions (comedones) and inflammatory acne lesions (papules, pustules, or nodules). Acne presenting as only noninflammatory or only inflammatory lesions is less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The face is a common site for involvement, but lesions on the neck and trunk may also occur frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/4,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27</a>]. In the study evaluating acne in 374 adult females with acne, approximately 50 percent of women had truncal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Some authors have divided facial acne in adult females into two clinical presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/5,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,30</a>]. One clinical presentation is characterized by multiple comedones that may be accompanied by a few inflammatory lesions. In this variant, comedones may occur on multiple areas, including the upper face. The other presentation is an inflammatory form characterized by papules, pustules, or nodules that primarily occur on the lower face (eg, chin, perioral skin, and mandible) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81177%7EPC%2F81886\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81177 graphicRef81886 \">picture 1A-B</a>). The reason for this particular distribution is unknown. </p><p>Although lower facial acne has often been viewed as a characteristic presentation of adult female acne (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81177\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81177 \">picture 1A</a>), the findings of the prospective study of 374 adult females with acne described above suggest that lesions limited to this area actually may occur in only a small subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Only 11 percent of women in the study had lesions limited to the mandibular area. </p><p>The severity of acne in women is typically mild to moderate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/3,5,21,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,21,30</a>]. It is common for adult patients with inflammatory acne to have only several active lesions at the time of evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H242120269\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple disorders may present with clinical features that resemble acne vulgaris. In particular, in adult women, the following disorders should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rosacea </strong>&ndash; Rosacea is a common inflammatory disorder that may present with inflammatory papules, pustules, telangiectasias, or erythema involving the central face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59815\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59815 \">picture 2</a>). The absence of comedones and the centrofacial location of rosacea help to distinguish rosacea from acne. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosacea-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perioral dermatitis </strong>&ndash; Perioral dermatitis (also known as periorificial dermatitis) is a disorder most commonly seen in young women that presents with clusters of small papules around the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73779%7EDERM%2F64577\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73779 graphicRef64577 \">picture 3A-B</a>). The skin immediately adjacent to the vermilion border of the lip is typically spared. This disorder may also occur in a periocular distribution.

When present, treatable or reversible contributors to acne (eg, hyperandrogenemic states) should be addressed. In addition, a history of previous therapeutic interventions should be carefully obtained prior to treatment selection to determine whether specific treatments were truly ineffective. A failure to respond to therapy is sometimes due to a lack of adherence to the treatment regimen for an appropriate amount of time or early discontinuation of an agent due to adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. At least 8 to 12 weeks of consistent treatment is required to judge the effectiveness of many acne medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of the type of acne lesions present (comedones versus inflammatory lesions), the severity of acne, the presence of undesirable acne sequelae (eg, hyperpigmentation, scarring), and contraindications to therapy is of value for the selection of an appropriate therapeutic regimen. Women should be questioned regarding the possibility of an existing pregnancy and plans for childbearing in the near future since avoidance of many acne therapies is preferable in pregnancy. Additionally, the patient's medical history should be reviewed to identify comorbidities that preclude the use of hormonal agents or other therapies.

Oral contraceptives with or without antiandrogenic progestins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> are the most common hormonal therapies prescribed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal therapy for women with acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of note, contraindications to hormonal therapies must be considered prior to the initiation of treatment.

Acne can have a negative impact on a patient's quality of life, and even acne that appears mild to the clinician may have a significant psychosocial effect on the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Furthermore, features such as postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring may persist long beyond the successful suppression of active lesions and can be highly distressing for patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78119%7EDERM%2F58817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78119 graphicRef58817 \">picture 6A-B</a>). Thus, in addition to the treatment of active acne, interventions aimed at improving acne sequelae can be of value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris#H36\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Therapy for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation'</a>.)</p><p>Many women also desire advice on skin care regimens. Picking or squeezing lesions, which can increase the risk for scar formation, should be discouraged, and gentle skin cleansing practices are recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Many topical acne medications can be particularly irritating in adult skin, and the daily application of moisturizers can limit transepithelial water loss and decrease skin inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Daily sunscreen use is also recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Home skin care recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>Although the methods for determining comedogenicity in skin care and cosmetic products vary and the importance of cosmetic products as contributors to acne is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], most dermatologists, including ourselves, continue to favor the use of skin care products (eg, moisturizers, cleansers, cosmetics, etc.) labeled as &quot;non-comedogenic&quot; and &quot;non-acnegenic&quot; for patients with acne and suggest the avoidance of occlusive agents. In addition, we advise patients who desire to use foundation as part of their makeup routine to select &quot;oil-free&quot; liquid silicone (dimethicone or cyclomethicone) matte foundations over oil-containing products, as the silicone-based products may be less likely to cause follicular occlusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H416289501\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the progressive decrease in the prevalence of acne with increasing age indicates that spontaneous resolution is likely to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postadolescent-acne-in-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], women may suffer from acne for many years.

Although the prevalence of acne vulgaris decreases with age, acne is a significant concern for many adult women. (See <a href=\"#H475461221\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The factors that contribute to acne in adult women and other populations are similar. Sebum production, keratinization abnormalities, <em>Cutibacterium</em> (formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>)<em> acnes</em> colonization, and inflammation involving the pilosebaceous follicle contribute to the development of acne vulgaris. (See <a href=\"#H159594937\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and associated factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although hyperandrogenemia promotes the occurrence of acne vulgaris, many women with acne have normal serum androgen levels. Local production of androgens within the pilosebaceous follicles or an increased sensitivity of sebaceous glands to tissue androgens may contribute to acne in these women. (See <a href=\"#H328490228\" class=\"local\">'Androgens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many women with postadolescent acne experience premenstrual flares. The reason for this observation is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H328490221\" class=\"local\">'Menstrual cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postadolescent acne most commonly occurs as a consequence of the persistence of adolescent acne. Women often present with both inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions. A subset of women with acne may present with lesions primarily distributed on the lower face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81177\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81177 \">picture 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H159594997\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of a hyperandrogenemic state should be considered in women who present with acne. If signs or symptoms of hyperandrogenism are present, laboratory evaluation is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H475461235\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and treatment principles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Hyperandrogenism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of adult women with acne involves a review of prior therapies, assessment of lesion types, and the evaluation for conditions that may influence the selection of therapy. Topical retinoids, antimicrobial agents, and hormonal drugs are often used for the management of acne. Gentle skin care practices are also recommended.
