Issues related to other coccidial organisms that can cause gastrointestinal infections in humans (<em>Cystoisospora belli</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Sarcocystis</em>, and <em>Toxoplasma</em>) are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See related topics.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are the only natural hosts of <em>C. cayetanensis</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100519\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100519 \">figure 1</a>). The role of animals as natural reservoirs is uncertain, and it is unclear whether zoonotic transmission occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p><em>Cyclospora</em> can occur as a locally acquired infection, among travelers, or in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. The initial cases were noted in the 1980s when the AIDS epidemic emerged and <em>Cryptosporidium </em>was identified as an important opportunistic infection; in some cases, <em>Cyclospora </em>oocysts observed on acid-fast stains were misidentified initially as <em>Cryptosporidia</em>.</p><p><em>Cyclospora cayetanensis</em> has a broad geographic distribution. The organism is most frequently reported in Latin America (especially Guatemala, Peru, and Mexico), the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. Risk factors for infection in endemic areas include contaminated water, food or soil, poor sanitation, and low socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Many cases reported elsewhere have been imported by international travelers or contaminated food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>].</p><p>In a United States&ndash;based review of sporadic cyclosporiasis cases, approximately one-third occurred in travelers, one-third were domestically acquired, and the travel status of the remaining one-third was unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among travelers, imported cases from Guatemala and Peru were most common; other travel areas included Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, South America, and Asia. In a review including 2902 infectious gastrointestinal disease acquired by international travellers, cyclosporiasis was diagnosed in 1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Increasing globalization of the fresh food supply and global travel have contributed to spread of <em>C. cayetanensis</em> to nonendemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. United States outbreaks in the 1990s were traced to contaminated raspberries imported from Guatemala [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Subsequently, other produce has been linked to outbreaks, including snow peas and snap peas imported from Guatemala [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. A 2013 outbreak involving 25 states (primarily Texas, Iowa, and Nebraska) and over 600 people was traced to salad mix and cilantro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Another United States outbreak in 2014 was also linked to cilantro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In 2017, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an advisory indicating that the number of cases reported as of August 2017 is higher than the number of cases reported by this date in 2016 (206 versus 88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As of September 20, 2017, there have been more than 1000 laboratory-confirmed cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus far, no specific vehicle has been identified, and it is unclear whether cases of <em>Cyclospora</em> infection in different states are related to each other <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to the same food item(s); investigations are ongoing.</p><p>In a Vietnamese study, contamination with <em>Cyclospora</em> spp oocysts was observed in 11 percent of market herb and water samples and 8 percent of farm samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A 2010 outbreak of cyclosporiasis affecting individuals on a cruise ship (73 confirmed and 241 suspected cases) occurred in Australia; the likely source was fresh produce from a Southeast Asian port [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Waterborne outbreaks have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], and soil-related transmission is also thought to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/5,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28,29</a>]. <em>Cyclospora</em> are thought to be relatively chlorine insensitive; outbreaks from water sources with acceptable chlorination levels to remove coliforms have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4844379\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. cayetanensis</em> is an obligate intracellular parasite. Both asexual and sexual stages have been observed in hosts, suggesting that only a single human host is required to complete the life cycle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100519\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100519 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Oocysts of <em>C. cayetanensis</em> passed in the stool are shed in a noninfective form and require several days before they become infectious, with sporulation occurring under environmental conditions of high temperature and humidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, direct person-to-person transmission is not likely.</p><p>Variable seasonal effects on cyclosporiasis have been observed; infection is often associated with hot <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rainy periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. The infective dose is unknown; high attack rates after foodborne infection suggest that the infectious dose is very low (ingestion of 10 to 100 organisms is probably sufficient for infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Small bowel biopsies in symptomatic patients have demonstrated several developmental forms of the parasite within epithelial cells. There is also jejunal inflammation with heightened numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes and degrees of villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/6,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,32</a>].</p><p>Nucleotide sequence variability has been described, but no virulence factors of the organism have been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Cyclospora</em> infection is characterized by anorexia, nausea, flatulence, fatigue, abdominal cramping, watery diarrhea, low-grade fever, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/1,5,6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6,14</a>]. Abrupt onset of watery diarrhea containing mucus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The median incubation period is about seven days following ingestion prior to onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/15,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37</a>]. Infected patients may have a single self-limited episode or a prolonged waxing and waning course; sustained diarrhea, anorexia, and upper gastrointestinal symptoms lasting for weeks or months can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In one series, the average duration of symptoms was more than three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Severe clinical symptoms occur most often among young children and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As children get older, infection tends to be milder, and the duration of infection is shorter. Asymptomatic infection has been described both inside and outside of endemic areas. In one series including 60 Mexican children with cyclosporiasis detected in stool samples, diarrhea occurred in 46 percent of cases, abdominal pain occurred in 40 percent of cases, and vomiting occurred in 19 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Symptoms can be more severe in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS,</span> although asymptomatic <em>Cyclospora</em> infection in the setting of HIV has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>Biliary disease has been reported in association with <em>Cyclospora</em> infection. Acalculous cholecystitis has been described in patients with HIV and resolved after initiation of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of cyclosporiasis is established via stool microscopy; detection of oocysts in the stool of a symptomatic patient is considered presumptive evidence of infection.</p><p><em>Cyclospora cayetanensis</em> oocysts (diameter 8 to 10 microns) can be detected by modified acid-fast staining of stool, in which oocysts can appear light pink to deep purple (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100527\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100527 \">picture 1</a>) or remain unstained so they appear as pale, round bodies surrounded by the blue staining background. An alternative is to use the safranin stain, which stains oocysts red to reddish-orange (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100525\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100525 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Fluorescence microscopy can also be used for detection of oocysts, which are autofluorescent.</p><p>It is important to distinguish the <em>Cyclospora </em>oocysts from those of <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, which are also acid fast but smaller (diameter 5 microns). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>A number of polymerase chain reaction assays have been developed for identification of <em>Cyclospora</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/14,45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,45-48</a>].

This was illustrated in a randomized trial including 40 adult expatriates in Nepal with <em>Cyclospora</em> infection; after seven days of therapy, <em>Cyclospora </em>was detected in stool less frequently among those treated with TMP-SMX than those treated with placebo (6 versus 88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Eradication of the organism correlated with clinical improvement, without relapse.</p><p>In the setting of immunosuppression due to HIV infection, higher doses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> longer courses of antibiotic therapy may be needed for effective treatment; effective antiretroviral therapy for immune recovery is also important. In one series including 28 patients with HIV infection and <em>Cyclospora </em>infection, all responded to treatment with oral TMP-SMX therapy; recurrent symptomatic disease within one month was observed in 43 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The optimal dose and duration of TMP-SMX for patients with cyclosporiasis and HIV infection with CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> is uncertain; a reasonable approach consists of TMP-SMX (one double-strength 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/800</span> mg tablet orally twice daily) for 14 days, followed by secondary prophylaxis with TMP-SMX (one double-strength 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/800</span> mg tablet three times weekly) to prevent relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitazoxanide</a> (500 mg twice daily for seven days) may be an acceptable alternative regimen for patients with sulfa allergy; its efficacy has been described in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/33,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,50-52</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ciprofloxacin</a> may be another alternative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclospora-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], although there is anecdotal evidence of treatment failure.
