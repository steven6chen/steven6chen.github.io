It can occur in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and type 2 DM irrespective of metabolic control or severity of diabetic retinopathy. &#160;</p><p>Specific criteria for the diagnosis of diabetic papillopathy and a clear differentiation of this entity from nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While diabetic papillopathy has a generally favorable prognosis and does not usually require treatment, it must be distinguished from more malignant processes such as papilledema, other infectious and inflammatory causes causing bilateral disc swelling, and those causing increased intracranial pressure.</p><p>This topic discusses diabetic papillopathy. NAION and other conditions causing optic disc swelling are discussed separately.

Initially described in younger patients with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>], subsequent publications have reported that DP also occurs in older individuals (up to 79 years old) with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of DP is uncertain. A diabetic microangiopathy has been proposed as an etiology, but no pathologic studies of DP have been reported to confirm or refute this theory. There is no clear association between DP and the state of metabolic control of the diabetes or with the stage of diabetic retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Most reported cases of DP occur in patients with long-standing diabetes, but duration of diabetes is not proven to be a risk factor for DP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/4,5,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,9</a>].</p><p>Most authors appear to believe that DP represents a mild form of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) with reversible ischemia of the prelaminar and inner surface layer of the optic nerve head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. The following observations support this theory:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes is a risk factor for NAION as well as DP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonarteritic-anterior-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The small optic cup or crowded optic nerve head (the so-called &quot;disc-at-risk&quot;) is frequently seen in the fellow eye in both DP and NAION [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/8,10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may develop both DP and NAION [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>]. Patients with NAION may demonstrate asymptomatic disc edema in the fellow eye either at presentation or in follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In one series, 43 percent of patients with DP had a history of NAION in the other eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with DP develop irreversible visual loss and optic disc pallor similar to NAION [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Approximately 30 percent develop NAION in the same or fellow eye in follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].</p><p/><p>One author described an entity of so-called incipient NAION (ie, disc edema without significant visual loss) in 54 patients who were seen in follow-up after a previous episode of NAION in the other eye or for unrelated conditions (eg, diabetic retinopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In this series, 63 percent of patients were diabetic and therefore met the usual clinical definition of DP. Perhaps somewhat atypical was that just 11 percent of these patients had bilateral disease. A high proportion of these patients, 45 percent, went on to develop NAION in that eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Arguments that support a pathogenesis for DP distinct from that of NAION include the observation that disc edema persists longer in DP than in NAION. While disc edema usually resolves by two to three months in NAION, a duration of 10 months or more is not unusual in DP. DP is also more frequently bilateral at presentation than NAION, and is more often described in younger age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below). Despite these qualitative differences, there is substantial overlap in the clinical features of DP and NAION [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>One author proposes that diabetes influences the course of NAION in a manner that explains the apparent clinical differences between NAION and DP. In their experience, patients with NAION and diabetes had several distinct clinical and demographic features that were distinct from patients with NAION without diabetes, including a longer duration of disc edema and a better final visual prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, it can be argued that this case series used a more inclusive definition of NAION that included patients who others might have labeled as DP and not NAION, making their argument somewhat circular.</p><p>Some hypothesize that the pathogenesis of diabetic papillopathy may be similar to the phenomena of early worsening of diabetic retinopathy sometimes observed after metabolic control ensues. In a study of 2066 patients with type 1 diabetes followed for a mean of 4.85 years (10,020 patient-years), bilateral diabetic papillopathy developed in five patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. During the year preceding this incident, all five patients had experienced a decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> at a maximum rate of &ndash;2.5 percentage points per quarter year, which was significantly different from the changes observed in the remainder of the study population. Photographs recorded before the onset of bilateral diabetic papillopathy showed that all five patients had small cup-to-disc diameter ratios in both eyes. Limitations of the study include its retrospective design and the low frequency of events.</p><p>An alternative theory for DP proposes that it is a distinct form of diabetic microangiopathy that primarily affects capillary integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, this is speculative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Visual loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with DP typically present with nonspecific visual complaints such as mild blurring or distortion of vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Alternatively, DP may be an incidental (asymptomatic) finding on routine ophthalmologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>].</p><p>Visual acuity is often normal or only mildly abnormal. When abnormal, acuity deficits are usually explained by comorbid pathology including diabetic retinopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> macular edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. Associated macular edema is usually related to diabetic retinopathy. Visual fields may be normal or demonstrate a slightly enlarged blind spot; other visual field deficits usually reflect comorbid pathology rather than DP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Funduscopic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Funduscopic examination demonstrates optic disc swelling, often with hyperemia and a striking dilation of the inner optic disc vasculature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63843\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63843 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The surface telangiectasia may be so prominent in some patients that it can be mistaken for neovascularization of the optic disc. One difference is that the vessels on the optic disc are radially distributed in DP as opposed to the random branching pattern of neovascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The abnormal-appearing vessels are limited to the disc surface and do not protrude into the vitreous cavity. This finding is also useful to distinguish DP from neovascularization of the disc.</p><p>The optic disc edema may be unilateral or bilateral; when bilateral, the involvement may be simultaneous or sequential. Various studies report that a bilateral presentation occurs in 11 to 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/5,9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,13,14</a>].</p><p>Macular edema is a frequent comorbid finding, occurring in 70 to 100 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/8,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19,20</a>]. The etiology of macular edema may be related to breakdown of blood-retinal barrier and leakage from retinal capillaries. However, serous macular detachment has been described in three patients with diabetic papillopathy occurring as a result of capillary leakage from the swollen optic nerve head in the absence of retinal capillary leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Other manifestations of diabetic retinopathy, usually nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, are seen in either the involved or unaffected eye in 35 to 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Examination of the fellow eye usually reveals a small optic disc cup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Optic disc findings resolve spontaneously in follow-up examinations; the reported mean duration of findings has varied in small studies between four and eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The optic disc then appears normal, only rarely demonstrating mild optic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluorescein angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluorescein</a> angiography usually demonstrates disc staining in patients with DP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>]. The dye leakage into the disc substance and peripapillary retina seen in DP contrasts with leakage anteriorly into the vitreous that occurs from neovascular tissue in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Fluorescein angiography also more clearly demonstrates the radial pattern of dilated vessels that is typical of DP and helps distinguish it from neovascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Capillary nonperfusion is variably seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. A less common finding in DP is a delay in filling that is similar to that seen in NAION [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic papillopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion; other entities such as papilledema, optic disc neovascularization, malignant hypertension, papillitis, and NAION need to be considered in the differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54401 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-differential-diagnosis-of-papilledema#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and differential diagnosis of papilledema&quot;, section on 'Differential Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because diabetic papillopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion, diagnostic testing is usually required. When the disc edema is bilateral, papilledema secondary to increased intracranial pressure is a potentially life-threatening cause and neuroimaging, usually with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by a lumbar puncture (LP) if the MRI is normal should proceed expeditiously. Patients with unilateral disc edema and other clinical and test features that are consistent with DP may not require MRI or LP. Ophthalmologic evaluation with visual field testing and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography can be helpful in excluding other causes and providing confirmatory evidence of DP. Patients should have ophthalmologic follow-up to monitor for vision loss and confirm the expected resolution of the disc edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-differential-diagnosis-of-papilledema#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and differential diagnosis of papilledema&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because DP produces mild or no visual loss, the prognosis is understood to be benign. However, some patients with a presentation consistent with DP develop vision loss over the next few weeks, either because of progression to NAION, worsening macular edema, or progression of diabetic retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/13,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22,23</a>]. In one series that included 19 diabetic patients with asymptomatic disc edema, NAION developed in 30 percent over a few weeks to a few months, as well as in an additional patient at 80 weeks, after the initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this series, the presence of retinopathy or a previous episode of NAION in the fellow eye did not affect the incidence of NAION. Similarly, DP does not appear to influence the progression of the underlying diabetic retinopathy, although this does occur in up to 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/5,9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, no treatment is required or recommended for patients with DP. Patients should be followed to confirm the expected resolution of the optic disc findings and to monitor for vision loss.</p><p>Some clinicians advocate the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with DP to ameliorate progression to NAION and or clinically significant macular edema. However, in one observational cohort, oral corticosteroid therapy did not influence progression to NAION [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The use of intravitreal and periocular (sub-tenon) injection of steroids has been reported in a small number of patients who developed severe optic nerve dysfunction from either the papillopathy or macular edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>]. These patients subsequently had substantial and rapid resolution of both disc and macular edema, as well as visual function after treatment. Intravitreal steroid therapy is also a treatment option for macular edema associated with diabetic retinopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment#H3693387\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Intravitreal glucocorticoids for ME'</a>.) </p><p>Intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGF), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a>, with or without steroids have been reported to cause rapid resolution of optic disc swelling and visual improvement in a number of published case reports of DP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/2,24-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24-31</a>]. Others have reported resolution of the optic disc swelling with panretinal photocoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-papillopathy/abstract/27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32</a>]. Many of these patients also had macular edema in association with optic nerve head swelling. Larger clinical studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy of these agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic papillopathy (DP) is a term that is usually used to characterize a finding of unilateral or bilateral optic disc edema with mild or no visual loss in a patient with diabetes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DP is associated with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
