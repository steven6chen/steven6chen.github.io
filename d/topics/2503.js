From the preadolescent years to the end of the second decade of life, bone size and bone mass increase rapidly. The accumulation of total bone mineral between the ages of 8 and 18 years is approximately 146 grams per year, with the greatest deposition occurring during puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Adequate calcium intake is necessary to maximize peak bone mass and to minimize both the risk of fractures in adolescence and the development of osteoporosis in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Adequate vitamin D is also important to bone health. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE GROWTH DURING PUBERTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several important associations exist between pubertal events, peak height velocity, and bone mineralization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-half of total body calcium is laid down during puberty in females and one-half to two-thirds in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]; by the end of puberty, males have nearly 30 percent more total body calcium than do females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a longitudinal study, bone width increased before mineral content, which increased before bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The changes occurred earlier in girls than in boys, with most of the changes in girls occurring in the 12 months before and after menarche. The increase in bone density during puberty is greater in African-American girls than Caucasian girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the pubertal growth spurt, bone growth outpaces bone mineralization, leading to a relative reduction in bone mineral content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a longitudinal study, the nadir of bone mineral density coincided with peak height velocity in both boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The same study reported that the incidence of distal radius fractures coincided with the same time point, suggesting that the relative paucity of bone mineral density is clinically significant.</p><p/><p>The peak bone mass attained by approximately age 30 years is the mass from which skeletal loss occurs later in life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77920 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Genetic factors influence skeletal structure and bone turnover and account for 40 to 80 percent of the differences in peak bone mass. Environmental factors are important during adolescence and are thought to account for 20 percent of the variance in peak bone mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, factors such as adequate dietary calcium and increased weight-bearing activity during adolescence help to maximize peak bone mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CALCIUM HOMEOSTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium homeostasis is a function of dietary intake, intestinal absorption, skeletal accretion and resorption, and urinary excretion. The large demand for bone minerals during adolescence is accompanied by an increase in the fractional absorption of dietary calcium during early puberty in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In girls, fractional absorption decreases from its early pubertal peak approximately two to three years after menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. </p><p>During adolescence, increased absorption and decreased excretion of calcium may partially, but not completely, compensate for low dietary intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The increase in calcium absorption during adolescence is thought to be mediated by calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, the most active metabolite of vitamin D), which also increases in concentration during the pubertal growth spurt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Vitamin D fortification of calcium-containing foods enhances intestinal absorption of calcium, whereas naturally occurring oxalate and phytate diminish it. These factors affect the absorbable calcium in foods, as shown by the examples in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52445 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>Most of the body calcium and much of the phosphate exist as hydroxyapatite, Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, the main mineral component of bone. Within the plasma, both calcium and phosphate circulate in different forms. Of the plasma calcium, for example, roughly 40 percent is bound to albumin; 10 percent is complexed with citrate, bicarbonate, or phosphate; and 50 percent exists as the physiologically important ionized (or free) calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Although only a small fraction of the total body calcium and phosphate is located in the plasma, the plasma concentrations of ionized calcium and inorganic phosphate are regulated primarily by parathyroid hormone and vitamin D metabolites, both of which affect intestinal absorption, bone formation and resorption, and urinary excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of calcium and phosphate balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the effects of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D, bone resorption of calcium is affected by certain medications. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Vitamin A</a> and synthetic retinoids increase bone resorption, whereas statins (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors), which are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, can increase bone formation and decrease bone resorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that affect bone metabolism&quot;, section on 'Statins'</a>.)</p><p>The primary function of renal excretion of calcium is the maintenance of overall calcium balance, not plasma calcium concentration, which is regulated by changes in bone resorption via the effects of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. Parathyroid hormone reduces urinary calcium excretion, an appropriate response if hypocalcemia has stimulated parathyroid hormone secretion. On the other hand, renal excretion of calcium is increased by dietary salt and protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/21,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25-27</a>]. Diuretics also affect calcium excretion, which is increased by loop diuretics and reduced by thiazide diuretics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of calcium and phosphate balance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diuretics-and-calcium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diuretics and calcium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CALCIUM REQUIREMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic studies have related bone mass or fractures in adolescents and adults to calcium intake during childhood and adolescence. The calcium requirement for adolescents is based upon the assumption that the dietary intake that leads to the greatest level of calcium retention is the intake that will lead to the greatest bone mineralization and will reduce the ultimate risk of fractures and osteoporosis.</p><p>Markers of mineral status are used to assess the consequences of differing levels of calcium intake and to determine the recommended requirement. The primary markers that have been used to evaluate various levels of calcium intake are measurement of calcium balance (net retention) and bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium balance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because virtually all of the calcium that is retained by children is used to enhance bone mineralization, calcium balance is a useful method to assess calcium requirements. Stable isotopic methods can measure calcium absorption and excretion at various levels of calcium intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Data from balance studies suggest that, for most healthy 9- to 18-year-old children, a threshold effect exists, with the maximal net calcium balance being achieved at intakes between 1200 and 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/16,17,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,28-31</a>]. The data in these studies are derived from white children; little data are available for other ethnic groups.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report measured calcium balance in 35 girls with a mean age of 12 who consumed 841 to 2173 mg of calcium per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Mean maximal calcium retention was 473 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Intake of 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> the 1989 recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium in adolescents, resulted in a mean calcium retention that was only 57 percent of the maximal value. An intake of 1300 mg per day was the lowest intake that allowed some female adolescents to achieve 100 percent of maximal calcium retention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study pooled calcium balances performed on 519 individuals from birth to 30 years of age, derived from 34 published reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For subjects of all ages, calcium balance was highly correlated with intake at lower intakes and tended to plateau at higher intakes. The threshold at which calcium balance no longer rose with intake exceeded the 1989 RDA for calcium for all the age groups.</p><p/><p>Comparing calcium balance in girls who were on very low (400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> versus higher calcium intakes (1200 to 1300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> showed a small adaptation with increased absorption and decreased excretion in girls with low intakes, but this adaptation was not adequate to account for the large gap in intakes. Net calcium balance was much lower in the girls with low intakes. This suggests that intakes &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> such as those of up to 20 percent of the United States population, may lead to large calcium deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Black girls appear to have greater skeletal calcium retention compared with white girls, which is consistent with observations of higher bone mass in adult black compared with white individuals. This was suggested by a study showing that black girls had greater mean calcium retention than did white girls (185 &plusmn; 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> difference, P &lt;0.0001) at all calcium intakes studied (760 to 1981 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">Ca/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This difference was a result of significantly greater net calcium absorption and lower calcium excretion. Despite this difference in calcium retention, the authors concluded that dietary calcium requirements did not differ with race. Accordingly, guidelines from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and others indicate that we do not yet have enough information to specify dietary requirements based on race. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempts have been made to calculate calcium requirements from measurements of the changes in bone mineral content during puberty. As an example, a cross-sectional study of bone mineral content of 228 children age 9.5 to 19.5 years using dual-energy X-ray absorption (DEXA) found that bone mineral content velocity peaked at age 11.4 in girls and 13.3 in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Peak bone mineral content velocity was greater in boys than in girls (320 versus 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/year)</span> and, based upon the assumption that bone mineral is 32 percent calcium, corresponded to a net daily calcium retention requirement of 282 mg in boys and 212 mg in girls.</p><p>More than 30 randomized placebo-controlled trials have examined whether increasing calcium intake with supplements improves bone density in healthy children and adolescents. Although many of these trials revealed increases in some measures of bone density, the increments were generally modest, as shown by the following results: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A metaanalysis included 19 of the trials, in which 2859 participants were treated with calcium supplementation (300 to 1200 mg daily) or placebo for 0.7 to 7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. There was a small effect on total body bone mineral content and upper limb bone mineral density (BMD). The treatment effect was small, with only a 1.7 percent increase in BMD in the upper limb, an increment of uncertain benefit on fracture risk in this age group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a three-year, double-blind trial, each twin of 70 pairs of twins was randomly assigned to diet alone (mean calcium intake of 908 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or a diet supplemented with 1000 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcium citrate</a> malate per day (mean calcium intake of 1612 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Among the twin pairs who were prepubertal during the study, the twins given supplements had greater increases in bone mineral density (BMD). The mean difference in the increase in bone mineral density after three years was 5.1 percent at the midshaft radius, 3.8 percent at the distal radius, and 2.8 percent in the lumbar spine. The twins receiving supplements who went through puberty during the study period or were postpubertal received no benefit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When effects of calcium supplementation are detected, there are conflicting conclusions about whether they persist after treatment is stopped. Some studies show a lasting effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], whereas others show reversal of the treatment effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In one long-term study, the treatment effect waned after four years, despite continued supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In the metaanalysis cited above, the treatment effect disappeared after cessation of therapy except in one site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review examined whether increasing calcium intake through fortified foods or other dietary changes increases measures of bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In longitudinal and cross-sectional studies and in clinical trials, most studies found little or no effect of increasing dietary calcium intake on measures of bone density. This review also concurred with the metaanalysis cited above that increasing calcium intake through supplements has minimal effect on bone density.</p><p/><p>Taken as a whole, these data do not provide strong support for calcium supplementation for healthy girls whose usual calcium intake is similar to that of most of the US population, even if that intake is well below the recommendations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several epidemiologic studies suggest a link between calcium intake, percent body fat, bone mass, and fractures in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/2,3,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,43,44</a>]. As an example, one case-control study measured bone density in 100 Caucasian girls aged 3 to 15 years with distal forearm fractures, the most common fracture in childhood. Bone density was reduced throughout the skeleton in cases compared with age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, after adjusting for weight, osteopenia was more common in cases than controls (20 versus 12 percent). In another series of 76 girls and 51 boys approximately 14 years of age, a high intake of dietary calcium was protective, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the link between calcium intake and fractures in adolescents remains tenuous, as these epidemiologic studies are small and not convincing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association may exist between postmenopausal bone density and calcium intake in childhood and adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In one study, bone density was measured with computed tomography (CT) scans in 255 postmenopausal women and correlated with a retrospective dietary history of calcium intake in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Women who reported drinking milk with every meal during childhood and adolescence had higher bone densities than did women who reported drinking milk less frequently. No correlation was found between current calcium intake and bone density. The obvious limitation of these studies is that they rely upon recall of dietary habits 30 to 40 years in the past.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538644820\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDED INTAKE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3818042987\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommended dietary allowance (RDA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium is 1300 mg for boys and girls 9 to 18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/8,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,31</a>]. This RDA was set by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, which estimated that maximum positive calcium balance is achieved at intakes between 1200 and 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> based on the results of calcium balance studies such as those reviewed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/16,17,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,28-31</a>]. This guideline is set to meet the needs of 95 percent of healthy children. The upper tolerable limit for calcium was set at 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The estimated average requirement (EAR, a measure of the intake meeting the needs of 50 percent of healthy children in this age group) was determined to be 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.

The failure of the short-term supplementation studies noted above to show a substantial long-term benefit in bone mineralization suggest that the higher calcium balance achieved with high calcium intakes may have limited or no long-term benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/34,35,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,42</a>]. However, intakes of 1200 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> calcium intake in children is safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and may have additional benefits such as decreasing body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Levels of calcium intake that are somewhat below the RDA (eg, 800 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> but taken consistently throughout growth may be adequate because of catch-up bone mineralization in later adolescence. In addition, exercise may be the most important key to long-term bone mineralization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Extremely low calcium intakes, such as less than about 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> may pose more substantial risks of inadequate mineralization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The calcium content on food labels usually is indicated as a percentage of the &quot;Daily Value&quot; in each serving. This &quot;Daily Value&quot; was set at 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> although this value was not determined based on adolescent requirements. Because only the percent daily value and not total calcium intake is on the food label, it is important to teach families about the daily value and how to interpret it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The daily value for calcium is a useful tool to compare different foods for calcium content, but the RDA is a more appropriate target when assessing adequacy of intake in individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Actual intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substantial gap exists between recommended calcium intake and the typical intake of children between the ages of 9 and 18 years.

Many children and adolescents are unaware that low-fat milk has at least as much calcium as does whole milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or that low-fat milk may actually help them lose body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Most of the calcium needs of children and adolescents can be met by milk and dairy products, which provide approximately 75 percent of the calcium in the average American diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Low-lactose and lactose-free milks are available for children with lactose intolerance.</p><p>Most vegetables contain calcium, although at low density. Thus, relatively large servings are needed to equal the total intake achieved with typical servings of dairy products. The bioavailability of calcium from vegetables generally is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An exception is spinach, which is high in oxalate, rendering the calcium virtually non-bioavailable. Some high phytate foods, such as whole bran cereals, also may have calcium that is poorly bioavailable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52445 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Numerous calcium-fortified foods are available, including soy milk, soy yogurt, and soy cheese, as well as calcium precipitated tofu and calcium-fortified cereals, breakfast bars, pastas, waffles, and juices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Calcium bioavailability in most of these sources is equivalent to that of milk, although bioavailability of calcium from some soy milks has been shown to be somewhat lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. As an example, one 8-ounce (240 mL) glass of calcium-fortified orange juice provides 300 mg of calcium, equivalent to an 8-ounce glass of milk. The fractional absorption of calcium from calcium-fortified breakfast cereal was equivalent to that of milk in a double-blind, randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Neither iron absorption nor fractional absorption of calcium from milk were affected by ingestion of the calcium-fortified cereal. In contrast, the bioavailability of calcium in soy milk is only 75 percent of that in cow's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Although foods that are rich in or fortified with calcium are preferred because they provide additional nutrients that are important for growth and development, calcium supplements can be considered for children and adolescents who have very low intakes of dietary calcium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78814 \">table 3</a>). The bioavailability of calcium supplements has not been evaluated in children and adolescents. In adults, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcium citrate</a> and calcium citrate malate are more bioavailable than is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcium carbonate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, the differences in salt-form bioavailability are relatively small for supplements and fortificants that are well solubilized, so the dose of a supplement can be selected based primarily on the content of elemental calcium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65819 \">table 4</a>). The use of supplements should be individualized based upon the dietary habits of the adolescent, risk factors for osteoporosis, and the likelihood that supplementation usage will be maintained. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of calcium stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although increased dietary calcium intake might raise the concern of calcium stone risk, the opposite effect is seen, as the incidence of stone formation appears to be reduced in both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Binding of dietary oxalate in the gut, leading to decreased oxalate absorption and excretion, may be responsible for this phenomenon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Calcium'</a>.)</p><p>A report from the Nurses' Health Study is compatible with the importance of the change in oxalate excretion and suggests the risk of stones may vary with the source of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A high dietary calcium intake was associated with a lower incidence of stone disease (relative risk 0.65 for highest versus lowest quintile of calcium intake), whereas calcium supplements were associated with a small increase in risk (relative risk 1.2 highest versus lowest quintile). The discrepancy was thought to be caused, at least in part, by the timing of calcium intake. Dietary sources are taken with meals, maximally binding dietary oxalate, whereas calcium supplements often were taken between meals, which would diminish binding of dietary oxalate, both maintaining oxalate excretion and, by keeping calcium free in the intestinal lumen, possibly increasing calcium absorption and excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER FACTORS IN BONE HEALTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of several other factors that impact bone density should be discussed when counseling adolescents and families about adequate calcium intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular exercise produces significant benefit to skeletal health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/8,50,60-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,50,60-64</a>]. In a 15-year longitudinal study of 84 males and 98 females, regular weight bearing from age 13 to 27 and a normal age-related body weight in adolescence and young adulthood were the most important factors in reaching the highest lumbar peak bone mass at the age of 27 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In another prospective study of 264 children aged 9 to 18 who were followed for 11 years, the important factors in achieving peak bone mass were non-smoking status, maintenance of normal weight, and exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, an excess of physical endurance training may interrupt menstrual function and have a detrimental effect on bone.

In a study of 460 9th- and 10th-grade girls in Australia, for example, carbonated beverage consumption was associated with an odds ratio for bone fractures of 3.14 overall and 4.94 among physically active girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The physiological basis for this is unclear and may be more related to very low mineral intake than an actual effect of any cola beverages. Furthermore, these data have not been confirmed at any other center or at any other site. Modest consumption of such beverages by adolescents, consistent with overall dietary guidelines and the primary use of low-calorie beverages, probably do not pose a risk of bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Caffeine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dietary consumption of caffeine is associated with increased renal excretion of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].

Nonetheless, a diet targeting calcium balance is safe and may yield beneficial long-term effects that are not detectable through the methods of these studies. Thus, we suggest the following multimodal approach in an effort to promote bone health:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children 9 to 18 years of age, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium is 1300 mg of calcium per day, ideally supplied by calcium-rich or calcium-fortified foods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52445 \">table 1</a>). If this target intake is not possible, an intake of 1000 mg, representing the average requirement (EAR) can be followed, but care must be taken to ensure that diets with very low calcium intakes, such as &lt;600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> are avoided. (See <a href=\"#H538644820\" class=\"local\">'Recommended intake'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium supplements can be considered for children and adolescents who have very low intakes of dietary calcium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78814 \">table 3</a>). However, it is generally preferable to achieve intake of calcium via diet, including fortified foods, because foods provide multiple nutrients that are important for bone health in addition to calcium, including phosphorus and magnesium. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Increasing intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consume adequate vitamin D to promote intestinal absorption of calcium. The recommended intake of vitamin D is 400 International Units daily in infants, and 600 International Units daily in children and adolescents.
