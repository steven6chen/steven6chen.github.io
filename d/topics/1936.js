Although safe for most patients when taken as prescribed, beta blocker toxicity is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In 2006, there were 9041 single beta blocker exposures reported to poison centers in the United States. Of these, there were 613 moderate or major adverse outcomes and four deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Complications following beta blocker overdose are related to excessive beta adrenergic blockade, and occasionally the proarrhythmic (membrane-stabilizing) activity of these agents on cardiac conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ingestion of other cardioactive agents in association with beta blockers increases mortality following overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Common and potentially dangerous coingestions include calcium channel blockers, cyclic antidepressants, and neuroleptics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>An overview of beta blocker intoxication will be presented here. A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82572 \">table 1</a>). A general approach to an adult patient with possible drug intoxication, and an overview of adverse effects of beta blockade, are discussed separately.

Activation of these receptors results in an increase in heart rate, contractility, atrioventricular (AV) conduction, and a decrease in AV node refractoriness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta 2, which are present in heart muscle but are more prominent in bronchial and peripheral vascular smooth muscle. Activation of these receptors results in vasodilation and bronchodilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta 3, which are found in adipose tissue and the heart. Activation of these receptors may mediate catecholamine-induced thermogenesis and may reduce cardiac contractility.</p><p/><p>Competitive antagonism of the beta receptor decreases cellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Beta-1 selective blockade results in depressed myocardial contractility, decreased automaticity in pacemaker cells, and decreased conduction velocity through the atrioventricular node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The lungs, peripheral blood vessels, glucose metabolism, and central nervous system are all affected by beta blockade. Nonselective beta blockade results in systemic effects including bronchoconstriction, impaired gluconeogenesis, and decreased insulin release. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of beta blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many beta blockers available for clinical use, and although they all inhibit the beta-adrenoreceptor, there are several characteristics that differ among these agents. Following overdose, manifestations of toxicity are observed in varying degrees, depending on the specific agent and dose involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In addition to beta-adrenoreceptor blockade, three properties that affect toxicity include the membrane stabilizing activity (MSA), lipophilicity, and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of the ingested agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82571 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Membrane stabilizing activity (MSA) &ndash; Membrane stabilizing agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acebutolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acebutolol</a>) inhibit myocardial fast sodium channels, which can result in a widened QRS interval and may potentiate other dysrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipophilicity &ndash; Beta blockers with high lipid solubility (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>) rapidly cross the blood brain barrier into the central nervous system, predisposing to neurologic sequelae such as seizures and delirium. Beta Blockers with this characteristic are more amenable to treatment with 20 percent lipid emulsion therapy in the setting of a clinically significant overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) &ndash; Many agents demonstrate a partial agonist effect at the beta receptor site, resulting in less bradycardia and hypotension in therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses. Bronchoconstriction is also less likely to occur with compounds that possess intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), or beta-1 selectivity. However, the protective effects of ISA do not completely prevent cardiovascular toxicity following intentional or accidental overdose.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXICITY OF SPECIFIC AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of all the variables contributing to toxicity, membrane stabilizing activity (MSA) appears to have the greatest influence on adverse cardiovascular effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82571 \">table 2</a>). Agents with significant MSA include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acebutolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acebutolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betaxolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betaxolol</a>, and oxprenolol. The effect of MSA is thought to be negligible at therapeutic doses, but in overdose can cause significant cardiovascular morbidity. In one retrospective study, 94 percent (15 out of 16) of patients with cardiovascular toxicity had a history of ingesting beta blockers with MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acebutolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acebutolol</a>, a cardioselective agent with partial agonist activity and significant MSA, is one of the most toxic beta blockers in overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Acebutolol toxicity may predispose the patient to ventricular repolarization resulting in arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sotalol</a> combines class III antidysrhythmic properties with beta adrenergic antagonism. Sotalol prolongs the action potential duration and increases the refractory period by blocking delayed potassium channels. This leads to prolongation of the QTc interval, and can contribute to the development of Torsades de Pointes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic use and major side effects of sotalol&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Carvedilol</a> has been associated with toxic epidermal necrolysis at therapeutic levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In therapeutic use, most beta blockers have half-lives ranging from two to eight hours, but kinetics can change in overdose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82571 \">table 2</a>).

The patient's pharmacy may provide valuable information regarding prescribed medications, the date of the most recent refill, and the total number of pills dispensed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who overdose on beta blockers become symptomatic within two hours following ingestion, and nearly all develop symptoms within six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. Exceptions to this general rule include ingestions of sustained release medications and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In these cases, delayed toxicity up to 24 hours after ingestion can occur. </p><p>Bradycardia and hypotension are the most common effects, and in severe overdoses can result in profound myocardial depression and cardiogenic shock. Ventricular dysrhythmias are seen more frequently following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acebutolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acebutolol</a> exposures, probably because of the increased membrane-stabilizing activity (MSA) of these agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82571 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. Other potential effects of severe toxicity include mental status change, seizure, hypoglycemia, and bronchospasm.</p><p>Mental status changes, including delirium, coma, and seizures, occur most frequently in patients with severe hypotension, but can occur in those with normal blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similarly, respiratory depression usually occurs in hypotensive, comatose patients, but has been reported in awake patients. Specific agents, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, are associated with neurologic effects in the absence of cerebral hypoperfusion. This was demonstrated in a report comparing the clinical course of patients following overdose with either propranolol or other beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the minimum pulse and systolic and diastolic ranges were not significantly different between groups, 29 percent of the propranolol group experienced seizures versus none in the non-propranolol group. This difference is probably due to the increased lipophilicity of propranolol, allowing rapid diffusion into the central nervous system.</p><p>In addition to the cardiovascular and neurologic manifestations, bronchospasm and hypoglycemia can complicate acute beta blocker intoxication. Early recognition and prompt treatment of hypoglycemia is critical. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although serum concentrations of most beta blockers can be measured, they cannot be obtained in time to be clinically useful and are generally performed only for academic or forensic purposes.</p><p>In patients with beta blocker overdose, we generally obtain the following studies: an electrocardiogram (ECG), a fingerstick glucose, serum electrolytes including calcium, and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. If calcium is administered repeatedly, levels should be measured every four to six hours. If an <span class=\"nowrap\">insulin/glucose</span> treatment regimen is used, glucose and potassium levels must be measured every 30 to 60 minutes. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Insulin and glucose'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Calcium'</a> below.)</p><p>Routine laboratory evaluation of any poisoned patient should include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and salicylate levels, to rule out these common coingestions, and a pregnancy test in women of childbearing age. </p><p>A serum lactate concentration above 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> is used to predict life-threatening overdose of some medications. However, this may be an insensitive finding with beta blocker overdose. In one retrospective study, four of nine deaths associated with beta blocker poisoning were associated with serum lactate concentrations below 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Additional tests are obtained based upon clinical findings. As an example, a plain chest radiograph is obtained in patients with signs of pulmonary edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers decrease conduction velocity across the atrioventricular (AV) node, resulting in PR prolongation; they also slow automaticity within the sinoatrial (SA) node, causing bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>QRS prolongation occurs more commonly when beta blockers with membrane stabilizing activity (MSA) are ingested. Significant QTc prolongation can develop following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> overdose as a result of its independent Class III antiarrhythmic activity. In severe poisoning, the electrocardiogram (ECG) can show <strong>ANY</strong> bradydysrhythmia, and can progress to asystole. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Asystole and pulseless electrical activity'</a>.)</p><p>A Brugada-like ECG pattern has been reported in the setting of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> poisoning, suggesting that other beta blockers that are lipophilic or possess membrane stabilizing activity might have similar effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H318752567\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of beta blocker poisoning is made clinically on the basis of the history and clinical presentation. Typically there is a history of overdose combined with findings of bradycardia and hypotension, which can be profound in severe overdose, resulting in cardiogenic shock. Other findings can include ventricular dysrhythmia, altered mental status, seizure, hypoglycemia, and bronchospasm. Although serum concentrations of most beta blockers can be measured, such measurements cannot be obtained in time to be clinically useful. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56212731\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many drugs can cause profound hypotension or bradydysrhythmia in overdose. Calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, and cholinergic agents must be considered when evaluating bradydysrhythmia potentially caused by a toxic ingestion.</p><p>Calcium channel blockers are less likely than beta blockers to produce alterations in mental status, and frequently do not do so unless the patient is in profound shock. Hyperglycemia occurs more often with calcium channel blocker toxicity, while beta blockers are associated with hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium channel blocker poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nausea and vomiting occur more often with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity than beta blocker toxicity. Digoxin may cause characteristic changes in an electrocardiogram, such as scooped ST segment depressions. Digoxin is more likely to produce rhythms of increased automaticity, such as atrial tachycardia with atrioventricular block, premature ventricular contractions, or ventricular arrhythmias.

Glucagon may be effective initially for a brief period, but prolonged treatment may become ineffective due to tachyphylaxis. Intravenous (IV) glucagon is given as a slow bolus dose followed by continuous infusion. An initial bolus of 5 mg intravenously is administered over one minute; if there is no increase in pulse or blood pressure after 10 to 15 minutes, a second bolus should be administered. The initial pediatric dose is 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span>. An effect should be observed within one to three minutes, with a peak response at five to seven minutes. If there is no observed effect after 10 minutes following a second dose, it is unlikely an infusion will provide benefit.</p><p>If there is an increase in pulse or blood pressure, an infusion is started at a rate of 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> (pediatric dose 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/hour)</span>.

One review of the available controlled trials in animal models found that glucagon increased heart rate (HR), at least transiently, but had minimal effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In 2006, a trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> in a swine model of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> overdose found no difference in survival at four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Catecholamine infusions may be added if the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, IV fluids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a>, and IV calcium salts are unsuccessful in improving cardiovascular performance, or as a temporizing measure until high dose insulin therapy starts to take effect. The vasopressor can then be titrated downward as tolerated.

High infusion rates may be necessary to overcome competitive inhibition. An arterial line may be needed to monitor blood pressure.</p><p>Catecholamines exert positive inotropic and chronotropic activity on the myocardium by stimulating adrenergic receptors and increasing the concentration of cAMP. One possible explanation for the lack of effectiveness of catecholamines in beta blocker overdose is that high doses are often required to achieve a therapeutic effect, and such doses may increase the risk of arrhythmia. In addition, some speculate that unopposed alpha constriction increases the cardiac workload, diminishing stroke volume and cardiac output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulin and glucose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose insulin is being used with greater frequency to treat beta-blocker overdose. In patients who manifest hemodynamic instability refractory to the other therapies described above, we suggest that a trial of high-dose insulin and glucose be administered, possibly in combination with other agents depending on the clinical scenario, and titrated upward until blood pressure stabilizes. (See <a href=\"#H61484287\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the selection of specific therapies'</a> above.)</p><p>The dosing regimen for high-dose insulin is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium channel blocker poisoning&quot;, section on 'Insulin and glucose'</a>.)</p><p>Of note, hypoglycemia is a possible complication of this treatment since the dose of insulin is much higher (approximately 10-fold) than that typically given for diabetic ketoacidosis. When necessary, euglycemia can be maintained by means of a continuous IV infusion of 5 to 10 percent dextrose. A hemodynamic response to high-dose insulin therapy is delayed for 30 to 60 minutes, therefore simultaneous implementation of other therapies to support the patient's pulse and blood pressure are generally required. Repletion of potassium and magnesium may be needed. </p><p>Animal studies and case reports of both isolated beta blocker overdose and combined calcium channel blocker and beta blocker overdose suggest that treatment with high dose insulin and glucose is effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/26,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30,31</a>]. However, the role for this therapy in pure beta blocker overdose remains unsettled, despite an increasing number of case reports describing successful treatment of patients with severe beta-blocker and mixed beta-blocker overdoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Often, such cases involve patients treated with multiple therapies (eg, calcium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a>, vasopressors) before treatment with high dose insulin, making it difficult to determine which therapy was most effective. High dose insulin has been well tolerated in patients, and has been administered for prolonged periods, up to 116 hours in one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>One animal study of insulin therapy in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> toxicity was terminated early when every pig in the insulin and glucose treatment group achieved the study goal of four hour survival, while those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> died within 90 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Cardiac output (CO) in animals treated with insulin and glucose increased steadily and consistently, while CO in animals treated with vasopressin and epinephrine decreased until death.</p><p>It appears that insulin exhibits a steady dose response curve, and may be titrated upwards until blood pressure improves. One study using a pig model of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> overdose, compared treatments with placebo and insulin at doses of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> per hour, 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour, and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. For each one <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> per hour increase of insulin, there was a statistically significant increase in cardiac output, and no ceiling effect was noted. </p><p>The pathophysiology of beta blocker intoxication is similar in many respects to that of calcium channel blocker (CCB) intoxication, for which high dose insulin and glucose therapy has been more extensively studied. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, both CCB and beta blocker poisoning appear to interfere with myocyte metabolism. In addition, beta blockers inhibit pancreatic insulin release further reducing available glucose and diminishing CO. Insulin appears to improve inotropy by providing substrate for aerobic metabolism within the myocyte.

Several case reports describe patients treated with both high dose insulin and ILE with good results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. ILE may be used early in the treatment of an overdose of a highly lipophilic agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>), or as an adjunct to other treatments as described above.

Patients who are asymptomatic at presentation after ingestion of a sustained release beta blocker should be observed for at least six hours to insure that symptoms do not develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Asymptomatic adults who have inadvertently ingested an amount of beta blocking agent no greater than their total daily dose (excluding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>) may be observed safely at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222).

A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82572 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxicity increases greatly when an agent has membrane stabilizing activity (MSA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82571 \">table 2</a>) or when other cardioactive agents are ingested concomitantly. Lipophilic agents cross the blood brain barrier and can cause neurologic dysfunction even in the absence of systemic hypotension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82571 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Cellular toxicology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Toxicity of specific agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sotalol</a> is a unique agent with an extended half-life that can cause QTc interval prolongation and severe ventricular arrhythmias in overdose. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acebutolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acebutolol</a> possess properties that increase their potential toxicity.

Bradycardia and hypotension are the most common effects. Cardiogenic shock and ventricular dysrhythmias can occur with severe overdose. Other potential effects of severe toxicity include mental status change, seizure, hypoglycemia, and bronchospasm. Hypoglycemia is seen more often in children. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain the following studies in patients with beta blocker poisoning: an electrocardiogram (ECG), a fingerstick glucose, serum electrolytes including calcium, and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Cardiac conduction delays can occur, most often a prolonged PR interval. In severe poisoning, <strong>ANY</strong> bradydysrhythmia can develop, and may progress to asystole. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severely symptomatic beta blocker poisoning (eg, profound persistent hypotension or bradycardia), we suggest simultaneous treatment with all of the following therapies&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Dosing is provided in the text and the rapid overview table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82572 \">table 1</a>).

Give the following treatments, in succession, based upon patient response: IV calcium salts, lipid emulsion therapy, vasopressors, and high-dose insulin and glucose. The implementation of each therapeutic option is discussed in the text.
