This typically occurs with inflammatory processes but can also result from hemorrhage into a node, immunologic stimulation, and malignancy.</p><p/><p>A complete physical examination should also be performed to look for signs of systemic disease. For example, associated splenomegaly suggests lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute leukemia, or infectious mononucleosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2571308120\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies may be helpful to evaluate or confirm suspected diagnoses based on the history and physical.

Imaging tests are helpful if it is not clear after physical examination that there is lymphadenopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to evaluate surrounding structures for abnormalities. Imaging by computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, Doppler technology, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help distinguish enlarged lymph nodes from other structures and define the pathologic process, especially cystic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

False negative results occur when the wrong node is taken.

The most abnormal node is selected if multiple node groups are involved. If no single node predominates, the choice in descending order of preference is supraclavicular, neck, axilla, and groin since the chances of a nonspecific result are greatest with axillary and inguinal nodes, and the frequency of the main complications of lymph node biopsy, infection, and damage to the neurovascular structures is higher in the groin and axilla. There are more vital structures in the neck, but they are relatively easily identified and avoided during surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The pathologist should know in advance that there will be a lymph node biopsy, so that the proper smears, stains and cultures will be done. Many of these techniques require unfixed specimens, and it may be difficult for pathologists to distinguish benign follicular hyperplasia from lymphoma without them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. As an example, when lymphoma is suspected, special studies using immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic techniques should be anticipated before obtaining the specimen.

Lack of information on tissue architecture is a specific problem with this technique when lymphoma is suspected. In one study, only 27 of 93 (27 percent) fine-needle aspiration attempts for initial diagnosis of lymphoma yielded a specific and complete histologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Core needle biopsy</strong> &ndash; Classification of lymphoma increasingly depends on immunophenotypic, genetic, and molecular features of the tumor, in addition to tissue architecture. Core needle biopsy provides tissue for special studies and some information on nodal architecture and is a relatively low-morbidity, inexpensive alternative to open biopsy in patients with suspected lymphoma in whom an intact node is not easily accessible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

When history and physical examination suggests a non-malignant cause, appropriate testing may be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis. However, some patients may not need any testing (eg, patients with cervical lymphadenopathy in the setting of a viral upper respiratory infection). Patients with specific or suspected non-malignant cause can be advised to follow up if the lymphadenopathy persists after resolution of <span class=\"nowrap\">illness/appropriate</span> treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378143632\"><span class=\"h2\">Concern for malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with lymphadenopathy, the probability of an underlying carcinoma, especially head, neck, and breast, rises rapidly with age. In one study, the risk of malignancy was 4 percent in patients older than 40 and 0.4 percent in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a population-based, case-control study of teenagers and young adults, the risks of leukemia and lymphoma in patients with lymphadenopathy were 0.15 and 0.28 percent respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>However, patients of any age in whom there is a concern for malignancy based on characteristics of the lymph node (eg, firm node, rapid increase in size of the node, or location such as supraclavicular nodes), symptoms (eg, systemic complaints of fever, night sweats, weight loss), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient characteristics (eg, firm cervical nodes in older patients who are smokers, axillary nodes in older women) should have appropriate evaluation for malignancy.</p><p>These patients should have imaging for further evaluation (specific imaging will depend on suspected malignancy) and should be referred for biopsy (of the lymph node <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other suspicious structure).

When lymphadenopathy is unexplained after the history and physical, the subsequent workup depends upon whether the adenopathy is localized or generalized. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Localized lymphadenopathy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H518522440\" class=\"local\">'Generalized lymphadenopathy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Localized lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with localized lymphadenopathy without history or physical examination findings to suggest malignancy, we check a complete blood count (CBC), as well as targeted laboratory studies based upon the patient&rsquo;s age, history, and risk factors or exposures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F109481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109481 \">table 5</a>). For example, in a young patient with recent fever, adenopathy, and sore throat, a CBC with differential, heterophile Ab, and immunoglobulin M for cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis would be ordered. An adult with adenopathy, fever, weight loss, and night sweats would be initially evaluated with a CBC with differential, chest radiograph, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a>. Adenopathy in the drainage area of an associated skin ulcer would trigger specific tests depending on the circumstances, for example, sporotrichosis in a gardener, tularemia in a hunter or hiker, or <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em> in a fisherman. If no etiology is identified, patients can be observed for three to four weeks. They should be advised to return sooner if they develop new symptoms, notice rapid changes in the lymph node, or develop other lymphadenopathy during this time.</p><p>Biopsy is appropriate if an abnormal node has not resolved after four weeks. This approach is safe and avoids unnecessary biopsies since the adenopathy will resolve or the cause will become obvious in many patients during that time. Even with &quot;can't miss&quot; diagnoses such as Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck cancer, or tuberculosis, the window of opportunity for effective treatment is likely to remain open during this period of observation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many patients with unexplained lymphadenopathy (and their clinicians) are concerned about the possibility of malignancy. Many such studies from referral centers are based on case series of node biopsies, however, and therefore overestimate the risk of malignancy in patients presenting to primary care, only a small fraction of whom are sent for biopsy. The prevalence of malignancy in lymph node biopsies performed in referral centers approaches 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. In a setting where patients were referred from primary care providers, the prevalence of malignancy was 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in a typical primary care practice, the prevalence is much lower. As an example, a retrospective study of patients presenting to a family clinician with unexplained lymphadenopathy found that only 1.1 percent of nodes were malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This Dutch study estimated the annual incidence of unexplained lymphadenopathy at 0.6 percent in the general population, of whom 10 percent were referred to a subspecialist, 3.2 percent required a biopsy, and 1.1 percent were diagnosed with a malignancy. Two case series of patients with adenopathy from primary care support this low prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518522440\"><span class=\"h3\">Generalized lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of patients with generalized lymphadenopathy without suspected diagnosis based on history and physical examination should start with a CBC, chest radiograph, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing. If these are normal, other considerations include testing for tuberculosis and syphilis, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and heterophile test, although these are often of low yield in the absence of a more specific indication. If the diagnosis is still uncertain, a biopsy of the most abnormal node should be obtained.
