Some experts have proposed dividing invasive <em>Candida</em> infections into three subgroups: candidemia without deep-seated or visceral involvement, candidemia with deep-seated or visceral <em>Candida</em> infection, and deep-seated (visceral) candidiasis without candidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In at least one study, each entity was responsible for approximately one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is made most easily in those patients with positive blood cultures, but the low sensitivity of blood cultures means that some patients with deep-seated infection may be missed. More rapid techniques for identifying yeasts in blood cultures and refinement of non&ndash;culture-based techniques are active areas of investigation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Empiric treatment of patients who are at high risk for invasive infection with <em>Candida</em> species is necessary in some situations and is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults#H230581572\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Empiric antifungal therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Candidiasis is an increasingly important nosocomial infection. Although <em>C. albicans</em> is the most common cause of candidemia, there has been increased isolation of non-albicans species of <em>Candida</em> in recent years. Patients in the intensive care unit and those who are immunocompromised are most at risk for the development of candidemia.</p><p>The epidemiology of and risk factors for candidemia are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of candidemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of candidemia vary from minimal fever to a full-blown sepsis syndrome that is indistinguishable from severe bacterial infection. Invasive candidiasis is defined by hematogenous spread to multiple viscera (eg, eye, kidney, heart valves, brain).</p><p>Clinical clues on physical examination to hematogenous spread of <em>Candida</em> include characteristic eye lesions (chorioretinitis with or without vitritis), skin lesions, and, much less commonly, muscle abscesses.</p><p>The frequency of eye lesions in patients with candidemia has been variable, ranging from 2 to 26 percent in different studies. There appears to be a decrease in cases of chorioretinitis that present with vitritis. This is due, in part, to early examination at the time when only chorioretinitis is present and to the widespread treatment of every patient who has candidemia. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis#H27883735\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Skin lesions tend to appear suddenly as clusters of painless pustules on an erythematous base; they can occur on any area of the body. The lesions vary from tiny pustules that can be easily missed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55977\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55977 \">picture 1</a>) to others that are nodular, several centimeters in diameter, and appear necrotic in the center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75717\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75717 \">picture 2</a>). In severely neutropenic patients, the lesions may be macular rather than pustular. In patients with negative blood cultures, the recognition of these lesions as a manifestation of candidemia and subsequent punch biopsy may lead to the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Less commonly, patients describe soreness in a discrete muscle group caused by <em>Candida</em> microabscesses. Examination reveals a tender muscle that may be warm and swollen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64945\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64945 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>In addition to these typical peripheral sites of involvement, signs of multiorgan system failure may be present due to involvement of the kidneys, heart, liver, spleen, lungs, eyes, and brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52139\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52139 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>Other manifestations of invasive candidiasis and approach to empiric treatment are discussed in detail separately.

In patients with focal findings (eg, skin lesions or parenchymal involvement), biopsy should be performed for staining, culture, and histopathologic evaluation. When available, we suggest sending the beta-D-glucan assay because it can be a useful adjunct to blood cultures and biopsy and can be particularly useful in patients with deep-seated invasive candidiasis (eg, intraabdominal candidiasis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13881850\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture and stain of biopsy material</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Directed biopsy of sites of involvement often leads to a definitive diagnosis. Material obtained by scraping the base of a pustule should be submitted to the microbiology laboratory for Gram stain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70812\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70812 \">picture 5</a>) and culture. More commonly, a punch biopsy is performed and the tissue is submitted for culture and for histopathologic examination using special stains for fungi.</p><p>Punch biopsies of skin or tissue biopsy will show microabscesses, and special stains will show budding yeasts and often pseudohyphae or hyphae that are characteristic of <em>Candida</em> species.</p><p>Clinicians frequently must rely upon clinical judgment about the probability of candidemia as an explanation for a patient's symptoms while awaiting the return of blood cultures. Certain findings on physical examination, especially the presence of suggestive skin or eye lesions, can alert the clinician to the possibility of <em>Candida</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most obvious method to detect candidemia is to grow the organism from the blood. Unfortunately, blood culture techniques are relatively insensitive. Studies from several decades ago showed that blood cultures were positive in only approximately 50 percent of patients who were found to have disseminated candidiasis at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Although similar autopsy-based studies have not been reported since the advent of modern blood culture techniques, there have been many studies comparing the sensitivity of different blood culture systems for the detection of yeasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The introduction of the lysis-centrifugation method (Isolator tube) improved the detection of yeasts when compared with other blood culture systems. Subsequent changes in the culture media used in the BACTEC and BactiAlert systems, allowing enhanced growth of yeasts, have made these systems as sensitive as the lysis-centrifugation technique for detecting <em>Candida</em> species in blood.</p><p>A drawback of all blood culture systems for the diagnosis of candidemia is that one to three days are required for growth and an additional one to two days for identification of the organism after subculture onto agar medium. For a seriously ill patient, more rapid and more sensitive techniques are essential.</p><p>Several techniques have been developed that decrease the time to identification of the most common <em>Candida</em> species once a blood culture bottle shows growth and yeasts are seen on the smear of the bottle contents. Using the technique of peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH), <em>C. albicans</em> and <em>C. glabrata </em>can be identified within hours of a blood culture becoming positive for yeast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Another technique is matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Using this technique, proteins released from <em>Candida</em> spp are detected in a blood culture and are compared with a large database of proteins from many species of yeast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry can be used directly on material taken from a blood culture bottle that is positive for yeast, and results can be read in as short a period as 30 minutes.</p><p>A study that compared the performance of blood cultures with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the beta-D-glucan assay is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Polymerase chain reaction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-culture methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the last several decades, substantial efforts have been directed at the development of non&ndash;culture-based method for the diagnosis of candidemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta-D-glucan and other antigen assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of circulating <em>Candida</em> antigens or metabolites has been thought to hold more promise than antibody-based methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Assays for several cell wall components, cytoplasmic antigens, and the metabolite arabinitol are not sufficiently sensitive for diagnostic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The most promising antigen assay is based upon the detection of beta-D-glucan, which is present in the cell wall of many fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Thus, this assay is not specific for <em>Candida</em>. As noted above, when available, we suggest sending the beta-D-glucan assay because it can be a useful adjunct to blood cultures and biopsy and is particularly useful in patients with deep-seated invasive candidiasis (eg, intraabdominal candidiasis).</p><p>In one multicenter study of 163 patients with proven or probable invasive fungal infections and 170 patients without invasive fungal infections, 107 patients had proven candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Depending on the cutoff value chosen as positive, between 78 and 81 percent of the 107 patients with proven candidiasis had positive results using the beta-D-glucan assay.</p><p>Researchers in Japan have a longer experience with this assay, and the commercial kits available in Japan differ from those available in the United States. In an autopsy series of 456 patients that included 54 with invasive fungal infections, 41 patients had a beta-D-glucan assay performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Using a cut-off value of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">picograms/mL,</span> the positive predictive value of the assay was found to be 70 percent, and the negative predictive value was 98 percent.</p><p>Another study showed that a combination of blood cultures with the beta-D-glucan assay or the polymerase chain reaction increases the sensitivity of diagnostic testing compared with blood cultures alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is discussed in greater detail below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Polymerase chain reaction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3499818720\"><span class=\"h3\">T2Candida</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the T2Candida panel and T2Dx instrument (T2Candida) for the detection of bloodstream infection caused by <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. tropicalis</em>, <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, <em>C. glabrata</em>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>C. krusei </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The T2Candida assay can detect these pathogens from a blood specimen within three to five hours, far more quickly than blood cultures. The assay breaks yeast cells apart, releasing DNA; copies the target DNA; and detects the amplified DNA using magnetic resonance technology.</p><p>The FDA based their approval of T2Candida on two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a study of 300 blood samples containing specific concentrations of yeast, T2Candida correctly identified the organism in 84 to 96 percent of positive specimens. In a separate study that included 1801 patients, T2Candida had an overall sensitivity of 91 percent and correctly categorized nearly 100 percent of negative specimens as negative for the presence of yeast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The clinical utility of this technique requires further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One current focus of non-culture methods is on the development of a PCR assay for candidemia and invasive candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As is true of cultures, PCR can identify <em>Candida</em> to the species level. However, to date, there is no commercially available approved PCR test to detect <em>Candida</em> species.</p><p>For the detection of candidemia, the sensitivity of PCR has been previously reported to be similar to that of blood cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>] and, in occasional cases of invasive candidiasis, PCR has assisted in establishing the diagnosis when cultures were negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A study compared the performance of a newer real-time PCR assay, the beta-D-glucan assay, and blood cultures for diagnosing invasive candidiasis in 55 patients with invasive candidiasis (17 with candidemia, 33 with deep-seated candidiasis, and 5 with both) and 73 hospitalized controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The PCR assay was more sensitive than the beta-D-glucan assay for diagnosing invasive candidiasis (80 versus 56 percent) but had comparable specificity (70 versus 73 percent). The PCR assay and the beta-D-glucan assay had similar sensitivity for candidemia, but PCR was more sensitive for deep-seated candidiasis (89 versus 53 percent). Both PCR and the beta-D-glucan assay were more sensitive than blood cultures among patients who had invasive candidiasis. In patients with invasive candidiasis, the sensitivity of blood cultures combined with PCR or the beta-D-glucan assay was 98 and 79 percent, respectively. Thus, these two non&ndash;culture-based assays, when combined with blood cultures, have the potential to increase the sensitivity of culture methods for invasive candidiasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3499818714\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibody assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To date, no sensitive and specific <em>Candida</em> antibody assay has been developed that is useful for diagnosis. Because <em>Candida</em> are part of the normal microbiota, healthy persons have antibodies against these organisms, thereby decreasing the specificity of the assay. On the other hand, an immunosuppressed host may be unable to generate a vigorous antibody response to <em>Candida</em> infection, thereby decreasing the sensitivity of the assay in this high-risk population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3296164222\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
