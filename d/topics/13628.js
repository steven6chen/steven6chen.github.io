However, patients with a serious life-threatening illness experience high levels of functional loss, with increased dependency for their activities of daily living (ADLs) and mobility. Among the factors that can contribute to loss of function are prolonged hospitalization, deconditioning, pain, fatigue, depression, undernutrition, organ failure (eg, heart failure), neurologic injury, and musculoskeletal problems. Patients with cancer can additionally experience sarcopenia from direct tumor effects and fatigue from cancer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/1,2,6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6-13</a>].</p><p>Progressive debility, decline of physical function, and the perception of being a burden to others can have a major impact on most aspects of life in a palliative care patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; for some, it may prompt the desire for a hastened death and requests for physician-assisted death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>Many of the physical and functional impairments that arise in these patients are potentially modifiable through physical therapy and rehabilitation, yet these services are typically underutilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H143385975\" class=\"local\">'Underutilization of rehabilitation'</a> below.)</p><p>The concept of rehabilitation in patients with palliative needs would seem to be a paradox, but in reality rehabilitation is highly appropriate for patients with complex, progressive illness, depending upon the patient&rsquo;s goals. However, there are clear differences between rehabilitation in palliative care and the traditional rehabilitation approach within general medical care:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without life limiting or serious illness, rehabilitation is generally performed for a disability that has occurred at one point in time, and there is an expectation that further deterioration is unlikely. The aim of traditional rehabilitation is to maximize recovery, and the emphasis is on physical needs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of geriatric rehabilitation: Program components and settings for rehabilitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, patients with life limiting or serious illness may not only have a disability but they also have a condition where further deterioration is not only likely, but inevitable. The scope of rehabilitation in this context goes beyond physical needs and emphasizes a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to management of all symptoms whether physical, spiritual, or emotional. The goals are to reach the fullest physical, psychological, social, vocational, and educational potential consistent with his or her physiological or anatomical impairment in the context of environmental limitations, preferences, and goals of care, to maintain the highest possible quality of life and enable individuals to cope and manage their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175691561\"><span class=\"h2\">Modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main rehabilitation modalities are physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and swallowing therapy, each provided by specialists in their field. However, rehabilitation of palliative care patients requires a multidimensional approach that also addresses the emotional, social, and spiritual needs of patients and their families. As a result, rehabilitation in this context includes psychologists, dieticians, nurses, chaplains, and case <span class=\"nowrap\">managers/social</span> workers as well. All members of the interdisciplinary team should work toward common goals, which are defined by the patient&rsquo;s preferences and goals of care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H658346431\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of rehabilitation depends upon the patient&rsquo;s disease stage, function, and goals.</p><p>Defined categories or &ldquo;classifications&rdquo; of rehabilitation that were initially defined for cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] can be applied to patients with other life limiting disease processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive rehabilitation &ndash; Begins after the diagnosis of the potentially life limiting illness, and attempts to mitigate functional morbidity caused by the disease or its treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restorative rehabilitation &ndash; Attempts to return patients to their premorbid functional status when little or no long-term impairment is anticipated and patients have remaining functional activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive rehabilitation &ndash; Attempts to maximize function by augmenting self-care ability and mobility for patients whose disease has been progressing, and whose functional impairments are increasing and may not be reversible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative rehabilitation &ndash; Attempts to maintain as high a level of quality of life (QOL) as is feasible in terminally-ill patients by relieving symptoms (eg, pain, dyspnea, edema) and preventing complications (eg, contractures, decubitus ulcers). Aims to reduce dependence in mobility and self-care activities in association with the provision of comfort and emotional support.</p><p/><p>The intensity of rehabilitation changes according to disease progression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F107365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107365 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Even at the very end of life as the disease advances to its terminal phase, it is still possible to perform rehabilitative interventions at the patient&rsquo;s bedside such as range of motion exercises for patients&rsquo; limbs, massage for swollen limbs, or patient positioning to relieve cough or dyspnea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143385957\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular and open communication with patients and their families regarding the goals of rehabilitation is critical in designing the rehabilitation plan. Even in the advanced phases of a disease, rehabilitation can help maintain function or slow down functional decline and improve mobility and ability to perform ADLs through such means as strengthening, ambulation, range of motion exercises, and relief of pain and other symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, deciding upon appropriate goals for rehabilitation during the advanced stage of disease (particularly for patients with advanced terminal cancer) requires interaction among patients, families, and rehabilitation staff so that realistic goals can be identified in the context of the disease trajectory and the patient&rsquo;s goals and wishes for care. The rehabilitation plan must also consider the patient&rsquo;s environment, existing functionality, and available resources. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important point is that for palliative care patients, the measure of success of a rehabilitation program should not focus on length of survival but rather on QOL, <span class=\"nowrap\">function/independence,</span> and psychosocial well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Objective outcome measures of rehabilitation in palliative care patients may involve patient-reported parameters, such as improvement in mobility, pain scores, anxiety levels, and satisfaction with care, as well as caregiver-related outcomes, such as caregiver burden and QOL.</p><p>It must also be emphasized that these are patients with serious life-threatening illnesses, and patient condition and goals of care can shift dramatically from day to day. Fluctuations in functional status are therefore expected, and therapists must maintain some flexibility allowing for respect for patient choices and for frequent interruptions in the rehabilitation treatment plan. During each session, rehabilitation therapists should reassess and reevaluate each patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">modify/adapt</span> treatment plans as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143385969\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a growing body of evidence that the application of rehabilitation in hospice and palliative care settings is feasible, safe, and provides numerous benefits, both with cancer and noncancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/13,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22,23</a>]. A systematic review of 13 studies (one randomized trial, three prospective single-armed studies of physical therapy interventions, and nine retrospective case series examining the utilization and benefits of physical therapy) examined the benefits of physical therapy interventions (mostly <span class=\"nowrap\">strengthening/therapeutic</span> exercises, education, balance and fall-prevention training, and transfer training) in patients with a variety of life-threatening illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Benefits included a decrease in patient-rated musculoskeletal pain and improvements in function and performance of activities of daily living, mobility, endurance, mood, fatigue, and lymphedema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1439259645\"><span class=\"h3\">Cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the most common indications for rehabilitation in patients with advanced cancer are refractory pain, fatigue, dyspnea, deconditioning after a prolonged hospitalization, and the need to recover from disabilities (eg, swallowing disorders) that have resulted from the effects of the cancer or its treatment. Often, cancer patients are referred to rehabilitation services in order to improve their performance status and eligibility for additional treatment. Many of these conditions are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain#H44713453\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychological, rehabilitative, and integrative therapies for cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Rehabilitation and physical medicine interventions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-treatment#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care#H935168\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary rehabilitation and respiratory therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Assessment and strategies for management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Retrospective series and a small number of uncontrolled prospective studies comparing outcomes pre and post rehabilitation intervention show that general rehabilitation can improve function and QOL, and reduce symptom burden (without worsening fatigue) in patients with cancer, even if the illness is at an advanced stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/6,8-10,25-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-10,25-33</a>]. In addition to enabling independence in ADLs despite physiologic and anatomic restrictions, and reducing the sense of being a burden to one&rsquo;s caregivers, therapeutic interventions such as physical therapy may also be perceived as giving patients hope and a feeling of relief and general well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/22,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,34,35</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A landmark 1994 study of 301 terminal cancer patients who received rehabilitative services in the hospice facility over a six-month period prior to death concluded that rehabilitation (which included therapeutic exercise, ADL training, bed exercises, bed training, chest physiotherapy, swallowing exercises, thermotherapy, intermittent pneumatic compression, acupuncture, relaxed positioning with pillows, and use of brace, sling, and splints) was associated with improved QOL, mobility, and symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, and leg edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Sixty-three percent of patients considered the rehabilitation procedures to be effective. Perhaps more importantly, with an improvement in the level of ADL, it was possible for 46 patients to be discharged to return home for a period of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2013 study evaluated the effect of an interdisciplinary palliative care oncology rehabilitation program on function, symptoms, and well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Of the 173 patients with advanced cancer who were referred to the program, 116 were eligible to participate. The patients underwent a three-hour initial assessment in which they met with each member of the team (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, dietician, nurse, and physician) for about 30 minutes. After the initial assessments, the team jointly formulated an individualized plan for each patient which included medical and nursing assessments, physical exercise, and occupational, dietary, and psychosocial interventions. Measures of physical, nutritional, social, and psychological functioning were evaluated at entry into the program and at completion. For the patients who completed eight weeks of palliative rehabilitation, there were significant improvements across multiple outcomes including nutrition, depression, overall well-being, fatigue, general activity, and functional measures, including Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group performance status, the Timed Up and Go test, functional reach test, Berg Balance test, grip strength, and walking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F107380\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107380 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H143385981\" class=\"local\">'Patient assessment for rehabilitation planning'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Few randomized trials have explored the benefit of rehabilitation in cancer patients. A systematic review including 13 randomized trials published between 2009 and 2014 (1169 participants) evaluated the benefits of general rehabilitation among patients with advanced cancer; seven were limited to physical exercise alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The authors concluded that physical exercise was associated with a significant improvement in general well-being and QOL. Rehabilitation had positive effects on fatigue, general condition, mood, and coping with cancer. Physical function was not addressed.</p><p>Two of the trials included in this review specifically evaluated the benefits of physical therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One was a small randomized controlled trial evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a mixed rehabilitation intervention for patients with advanced cancer; the trial enrolled 41 patients, and 36 completed the trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The intervention arm (services were selected according to patient need; the actual number who received physical therapy or nutrition interventions was not reported) showed significant improvements in the psychological, physical, and patient care subscales of the Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]), and self-reported health state.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second was a pilot randomized trial of massage, mobilization, and local and global exercises (six sessions of 30 to 35 minutes each over a two week period) in 24 patients with terminal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

There is emphasis on an intensive and coordinated interdisciplinary approach. Patients suitable for inpatient rehabilitation should be able to tolerate three hours of daily therapy five times per week, and need active and ongoing rehabilitation intervention from multiple disciplines, at least one of which is physical therapy or occupational therapy. Inpatient rehabilitation programs are supervised by a rehabilitation physician (a physiatrist) with face-to-face visits at least three days per week. Acute inpatient rehabilitation is generally covered by Medicare Part A, Medicaid, and private insurers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143386011\"><span class=\"h3\">Subacute rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subacute rehabilitation, which is typically carried out in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) with rehabilitation services, offers coordinated interdisciplinary services to patients who can tolerate at least one hour of therapy each day. Subacute rehabilitation may also serve as a transitional program prior to discharge from a medical or surgical unit, and for respite care.</p><p>For patients in the United States, reimbursement issues must be considered. For patients covered by Medicare Part A in the United States, there are specific criteria for eligibility for subacute rehabilitation. The beneficiary must have been a hospital inpatient with a medically necessary stay of at least three consecutive calendar days; time spent in an emergency department or hospitalized with observation status does not count toward the qualifying three days. The beneficiary must also have been transferred to a participating skilled nursing facility (SNF) within 30 days after discharge from the hospital.</p><p>Additional criteria for a skilled nursing level of care must also apply, including that the patient requires skilled services on a daily basis.

After patients pay their yearly deductible for Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance), Medicare pays its share (80 percent), and patients pay their share (20 percent) of the cost for the outpatient therapy services. Medicare will pay its share for therapy services until the total amount paid by both patient and Medicare reaches a therapy cap limit.

Home-based rehabilitation is usually offered through home care and home hospice programs, and most can provide physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, social work, and skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis to home-confined patients who are not necessarily bedridden. Rehabilitation therapies are not offered on a daily basis, and the services provided are contingent upon the skilled need of the patient and the goals to be attained. A physician must certify a skilled nursing or rehabilitation need for eligible patients to help them recover from illness, injury, or an acute condition. Medicare Part A, Medicaid, and most private insurances cover this level of service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].</p><p>Medicare hospice benefits allow for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language pathology services to be provided for purposes of symptom control or to enable the individual to maintain activities of daily living and basic functional skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Examples include upper extremity orthotics to assist with manipulation of objects, lower extremity orthotics such as splints to promote joint stability and muscle function, and truncal orthotics for osseous instability. Phantom limb pain or stump pain may be ameliorated by a well-fitting prosthesis or the use of an assistive device such as a cane or walker to help in ambulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, physical therapists can work with patients, families, and caregivers in providing strategies for safe environmental manipulation or modification to allow for a suitable living or working environment for patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Examples include placing a recliner on a platform to assist with transfer, having a high stool in the kitchen to reach a cupboard, and adjusting the height and arms of the chair to assist in transfer.

Therapeutic exercise comprises a range of techniques that can be applied in anatomical planes or as functional movement direction. The types of movement include active movement, assisted active movement, resistive movement, assisted-resistive active movement, and passive movement. Examples of therapeutic exercise techniques include relaxation, massage, muscle reeducation, floor aerobics, suspension therapy, progressive resisted exercise, breathing exercise, postural training, work simulation, work conditioning, work hardening, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation using facilitation and inhibition techniques, graded activity program, and cognitive behavioral training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Therapeutic exercise may improve body mechanics through its beneficial effects on muscle strength, joint flexibility, range of motion, and balance. Reconditioning programs for patients with advanced illness such as cancer or other serious illnesses generally include graded aerobic and stretching exercises. Examples of equipment that promote aerobic exercise are treadmills, ergometers, and rowing machines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical modalities of therapy include traction therapy, compression therapy, therapeutic taping, and continuous passive motion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143386054\"><span class=\"h3\">Occupational therapist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The occupational therapist (OT) screens for and monitors performance deficits to modify and meet the changing needs of palliative care patients.

Rehabilitation is an integral component of a holistic palliative care approach that enables people to maintain optimal levels of functioning, regardless of life expectancy. Even in the advanced phases of an illness, rehabilitation can help patients to retain mobility and independence, and improve symptoms, all of which can contribute to a reduced burden on families and caregivers, and better QOL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-therapy-and-other-rehabilitation-issues-in-the-palliative-care-setting/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H143385933\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehabilitation of palliative care patients requires a multidimensional approach to meet the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs of patients and their families. Teams are interdisciplinary and can include PT, OT, speech language pathology (SLP), as well as psychologists, dieticians, nurses, chaplains, and case <span class=\"nowrap\">managers/social</span> workers. (See <a href=\"#H143385945\" class=\"local\">'Overview of rehabilitation in palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in the palliative care setting, the goal of rehabilitation can differ, depending upon the patient&rsquo;s preferences and values, as well as physical needs and availability of social support. (See <a href=\"#H143385957\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The application of rehabilitation in the hospice and palliative care settings is feasible, safe, and provides numerous benefits, both with cancer and noncancer diagnoses. For patients with cancer, rehabilitation can help manage refractory pain, fatigue, dyspnea, deconditioning after a prolonged hospitalization, and swallowing disorders resulting from the effects of the cancer or its treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1439259645\" class=\"local\">'Cancer'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain#H44713453\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychological, rehabilitative, and integrative therapies for cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Rehabilitation and physical medicine interventions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-treatment#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care#H935168\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary rehabilitation and respiratory therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Assessment and strategies for management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with noncancer diseases, rehabilitation can help manage symptoms, improve physical performance, and maintain overall quality of life.
