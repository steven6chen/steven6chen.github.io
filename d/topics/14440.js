Prolonged infusions attain the pharmacodynamic efficacy target defined for beta-lactam antibiotics more effectively than short infusions. Thus, a prolonged infusion administration strategy may improve microbiologic and clinical cure, especially when pathogens demonstrate higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Prolonged infusion administration strategies for intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics may include either a continuous infusion (over the entire dosing interval) or an extended infusion (over 3 to 4 hours).</p><p>This article will discuss beta-lactam pharmacodynamics, clinical evidence available for prolonged infusion strategies, the benefits and risks, and recommendations for dosing of prolonged infusion beta-lactam antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812391\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta-lactam antibiotics kill sensitive bacteria by inactivating key enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis, termed penicillin-binding proteins. The specific beta-lactam agents have different half-lives, but all demonstrate time-dependent killing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This refers to the phenomenon that the duration that the pathogen is exposed to the beta-lactam drug is the most important determinant of bacterial eradication and clinical response. This is in contrast to other antibiotic classes that exhibit concentration-dependent killing and post-antibiotic effect, such as aminoglycosides. </p><p>The duration of exposure is commonly measured as the percentage of the dosing interval that the concentration of free drug remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen (%fT &gt;MIC). The maximal bactericidal effect is achieved when the free drug concentration exceeds the pathogen&rsquo;s MIC by approximately fourfold for 40 to 60 percent of the dosing interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The optimal targets for %fT &gt;MIC vary depending on the specific drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F97448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97448 \">table 1</a>). Maximizing the duration of exposure can be accomplished in three possible ways: increasing the dose, shortening the dosing interval, or prolonging the infusion time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F99342\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99342 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Prolonged infusion administration strategies for intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics may include either a continuous infusion (over the entire dosing interval) or an extended infusion (over 3 to 4 hours) as opposed to traditional, intermittent infusion times (over 30 to 60 minutes). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812454\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although high-quality, randomized controlled trials to support prolonged infusion beta-lactam strategies are not available, rationale for this practice is in part based on pharmacodynamic principles and evidence of clinical benefit from observational studies and limited trials without evidence of additional toxicity. In addition, this practice is supported by a theoretical benefit of reduced emergence of drug resistance and, in some cases, measurable economic benefits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812461\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible clinical benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical data suggest that prolonged (extended or continuous) infusions of beta-lactams are at least equally effective as and, in certain circumstances, such as critical illness, more effective than traditional intermittent infusions for gram-negative infections. These studies are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H42557215\" class=\"local\">'Clinical efficacy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186948969\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic advantage</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H431948450\"><span class=\"h3\">Less susceptible pathogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increases in pathogen resistance and rising MICs, as well as the limited number of new antibiotic agents introduced over the past 10 years, have forced clinicians to explore ways to maximize the administration of beta-lactams to achieve favorable clinical outcomes. Pharmacodynamic modeling suggests that patients with infections due to pathogens that demonstrate higher MICs but are still within the susceptible range would benefit from prolonged infusion strategies. (See <a href=\"#H95812391\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic background'</a> above.)</p><p>Predictive models of clinical response based on pharmacodynamic targets can help to identify optimal antibiotic dosing. These pharmacodynamic models allow inputs of different combinations of dose, interval, and infusion time to estimate the likelihood of attaining the targeted %fT &gt;MIC. A predictive modeling approach also allows for tailoring to certain patient population characteristics or local patterns of drug resistance, specifically the local pathogen-antibiotic MIC distribution. Several studies utilizing such models have supported prolonged infusion strategies over traditional intermittent dosing for infections due to <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and other gram-negative pathogens with higher MICs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Estimates from pharmacodynamic models are often the basis for alternative dosing strategies that are then evaluated clinically. (See <a href=\"#H42557215\" class=\"local\">'Clinical efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H431948382\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with altered pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Critically ill, young, or obese patients, typically with recent surgery or trauma, may have creatinine clearance &gt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and be infected with higher-MIC, hospital-acquired pathogens. Critical illness can also lead to variable pharmacokinetics, such as augmented drug clearance, altered volumes of distribution, abnormal fluid balance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in protein binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Achieving adequate serum levels of antibiotics in these populations can thus be extremely challenging; higher doses and prolonged infusions may be the best pharmacologic approach in such situations.</p><p>The Defining Antibiotic Levels in Intensive Care Unit Patients (DALI) study assessed whether beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients achieves drug concentrations associated with maximal activity and whether achievement of target concentrations correlate with clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This prospective, multinational, pharmacokinetic point-prevalence study included 248 patients who received various beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of an infection. The severity of illness in the study population was high (median APACHE II score 18). Thirty-three percent of infected patients received prolonged infusion dosing of beta-lactams. Patients who received prolonged infusion therapy were more likely to achieve the pharmacodynamic target (93 versus 80 percent of patients receiving intermittent infusions). Achieving an antibiotic concentration over the MIC for &gt;50 percent of the dosing interval (&gt;50%fT&gt;MIC) was associated with positive clinical outcomes for bloodstream infections but not with lung and intra-abdominal infections. This study demonstrated that critically ill patients have highly variable serum drug levels and that prolonged infusions do assist in attaining pharmacodynamic targets. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H431948801\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available data provide limited information about adverse events with prolonged infusion strategies. Prolonged infusions will maintain higher serum and tissue drug concentrations than intermittent dosing, which may raise concerns about the potential for drug toxicity. However, beta-lactam drugs are well tolerated in general, and prolonged infusion strategies appear to have no more toxicity risk than intermittent dosing. In studies that have examined adverse events, no significant differences in incidence of adverse reactions were recognized between prolonged and intermittent infusion strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>One potential exception to this is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doripenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doripenem</a> given as a prolonged infusion, which has been associated with worse outcomes compared with intermittent infusion in a single trial. (See <a href=\"#H42557378\" class=\"local\">'Carbapenems'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812468\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced selection for drug resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolonged infusions provide shorter periods of time when serum and tissue levels of the antibiotic fall lower than the MIC. Thus, there is less bacterial regrowth occurring between doses and more rapid bacterial eradication. Rapid bacterial killing, reduced organism burden, and reduced time in the presence of sub-MIC antibiotic concentrations may result in reduced opportunities for pathogens to acquire new genetic elements or de-repress chromosomal resistance genes (eg, AmpC beta-lactamases). Additionally, prolonged infusion strategies can result in lower overall exposure to the antibiotic (ie, a lower overall daily dose) without a decrease in serum concentrations (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, on a theoretical basis, prolonged infusion strategies may provide less selective pressure than short infusions and avoid the emergence of acquired drug resistance. Evidence of this theoretical benefit is an area for future study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812475\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Economic benefits of prolonged infusion strategies have been cited in several, single-center, observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/4,5,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10,11</a>]. As an example, manufacturer&rsquo;s dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> for patients with normal renal function (30-minute infusion of 3.375 to 4.5 grams every 6 hours) results in a total of 13.5 to 18 grams of drug per day. In contrast, an extended infusion strategy (4-hour infusion of 3.375 grams every 8 hours) results in a total of 10.125 grams of drug per day. The extended infusion strategy saves essentially one dose of piperacillin-tazobactam per patient day which results in drug acquisition cost savings. One study estimated that extended infusion piperacillin-tazobactam employed in a 650-bed hospital could reduce annual acquisition costs by approximately 68,750 to 137,500 US dollars per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition to acquisition costs, estimates of cost savings due to reduced length of stay and reduced complication rates may also be significant. In an analysis that integrated extended infusion <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> into a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) pathway in three ICUs, the particular dosing regimens resulted in higher per day antibiotic acquisition costs but were estimated to reduce post-VAP hospital costs by 40,000 US dollars per patient, largely because of shorter lengths of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Finally, if the prolonged infusion protocol results in longer dosing intervals (eg, every 8 hours as opposed to every 6 hours), there may be savings realized in nursing labor costs due to one less administration event per patient day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812482\"><span class=\"h2\">Ease of administration in the outpatient setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous infusions are easier to administer than intermittent infusions in the ambulatory setting with dedicated intravenous lines and portable, battery-powered infusion pumps. As an example, patients must access their line and change the cartridge on their pump only once in a 24-hour period, rather than every four hours with intermittent infusions. This is particularly convenient for patients who require prolonged durations of therapy delivered in the ambulatory setting (eg, outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy for endocarditis or osteomyelitis). Continuous infusions in the outpatient setting is typically used for penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a>. Many outpatient pumps can also be programmed to allow prolonged infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812489\"><span class=\"h1\">DRAWBACKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential drawbacks to prolonged infusion beta-lactam dosing strategies include several logistical barriers, need for continued intravenous line access, and issues of compatibility with coadministered drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812495\"><span class=\"h2\">Logistical barriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of prolonged infusions require utilization of the intravenous pump for longer periods of time, which may be problematic for patients with limited intravenous access or lower levels of nursing care. As an example, patients on a medical ward may need to ambulate to the bathroom or leave the unit for procedures, which can lead to interruptions in the infusion and impaired drug delivery. Additionally, nurses must be aware of the need to flush intravenous line tubing at the end of the infusion to allow for complete drug administration. Prolonged infusions also may result in higher intravenous catheter utilization for additional venous access. Risks of catheter-associated infections and other potential complications must be weighed with benefits of prolonged infusions for individual patients. Central catheters should not be placed for the sole reason of delivering prolonged infusions unless medical providers believe that the benefit to the individual patient outweighs the risks of central catheter placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812502\"><span class=\"h2\">Compatibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administering other intravenous medications through the same intravenous line used for a prolonged infusion of beta-lactams can be a challenge because of compatibility issues. Clinical pharmacists can assist nursing to help resolve medication scheduling and compatibility issues; however, if shifting medication administration times does not alleviate compatibility issues, reversion to intermittent infusion may be appropriate. Standard textbooks for compatibility may be used as a reference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>A common compatibility challenge occurs with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> coadministration because compatibility is dependent on the vancomycin concentration. Of note, branded piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) is formulated with EDTA, which allows for expanded compatibility with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>, and lactated Ringer&rsquo;s solution. The physical compatibility of vancomycin has been evaluated with both branded and generic piperacillin-tazobactam (which does not contain EDTA) in concentrations typical for prolonged infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Vancomycin concentrations of less than or equal to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> were compatible using simulated Y-site administration with piperacillin-tazobactam 33.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> up to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span>. Individual institutions have different practices for compounded concentrations of vancomycin and variable piperacillin-tazobactam products. Clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists should evaluate compatibility based on available products prior to attempting to Y-site these drugs together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95812509\"><span class=\"h2\">Stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If drugs are administered over a prolonged period of time, they must be stable over that time, and so not all drugs are appropriate for prolonged infusions. Stability of beta-lactams can be influenced by the type of intravenous fluid used to reconstitute the drug, the concentration of the final solution, and the storage temperature. Some beta-lactam agents, such as carbapenems, are not stable at room temperature for long durations. The product information for branded <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> (Merrem) notes that meropenem prepared for infusion in normal saline is stable for 1 hour at room temperature and up to 15 hours refrigerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, studies examining stability have shown that meropenem prepared for infusion is stable for up to 4 hours at room temperature and up to 24 hours refrigerated (at concentrations up to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL),</span> which is consistent with stability documentation on generic product information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ampicillin</a> and <span class=\"nowrap\">ampicillin/sulbactam</span> are often limited to intermittent infusions because of their short half-lives; however, individual institutions may have extended stability data to allow for safe administration of continuous ampicillin and <span class=\"nowrap\">ampicillin/sulbactam,</span> particularly for outpatient home infusion therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42557215\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical data supporting prolonged infusion beta-lactam antibiotic administration resides largely in observational or non-randomized prospective studies, predominantly in adults. A clinical benefit of prolonged infusion strategies has not been definitively demonstrated in randomized controlled trials. Possible reasons that existing randomized controlled trials have not yet demonstrated benefit include small sample size and low study quality. Other limitations have been the inclusion of heterogeneous patient populations, including patients infected with highly susceptible pathogens and low severity of illness, in whom traditional dosing strategies may not need to be improved upon. Finally, there have been variable prolonged and intermittent dosing strategies used in the available studies which make compiling data in systematic reviews and meta-analyses problematic. Well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to provide definitive evidence that prolonged infusion beta-lactam antibiotics provide clinical benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42557849\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult populations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H878664412\"><span class=\"h3\">Pooled data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The totality of the data suggests that prolonged (extended or continuous) infusions of beta-lactams are at least equally effective and, in some cases, more effective than traditional intermittent infusions for gram-negative infections in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/7,8,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,22-24</a>]. In observational data, the greatest benefit of prolonged infusions has been primarily in critically ill patients with higher severity of illness and in patients with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/3-5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,7</a>]. However, the data overall are limited by small samples sizes, heterogeneity of patient populations and dosing strategies, and other methodologic flaws. (See <a href=\"#H42557215\" class=\"local\">'Clinical efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 29 studies, including 18 randomized controlled trials, comparing infusions strategies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, pooled data demonstrated lower mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.83) with extended or continuous compared with intermittent infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis of six studies evaluating carbapenems <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> piperacillin-tazobactam for moderate to severe gram-negative infections found a lower mortality risk with prolonged compared with intermittent infusions (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.83) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Subsequent trials have had mixed results, but they demonstrate at least equivalent efficacy of continuous infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/22,23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,25,26</a>]. In a trial from 25 intensive care units across Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong, 443 patients with severe sepsis were randomly assigned to receive continuous versus intermittent infusion of the selected beta-lactam (piperacillin-tazobactam, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticarcillin-and-clavulanate-potassium-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticarcillin-clavulanate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There were no differences in ICU-free days at 28 days (18 versus 20 days) or clinical cure rates at 14 days (52 versus 50 percent) with continuous versus intermittent infusion. Approximately one quarter of each group was receiving renal replacement therapy, which may have attenuated the difference in drug levels achieved with the two-drug administration strategies. In contrast, in a trial of 140 patients with severe sepsis in two ICUs in Malaysia, none of whom were on renal replacement therapy, clinical cure rates at 14 days were higher among the patients randomly assigned to continuous versus intermittent therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>, or meropenem (56 versus 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There were no differences in ICU-free days at 28 days (20 versus 17 days).</p><p>Studies of individual beta-lactam agents are discussed below. In general, the most promising data are for extended infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>. In the meta-analysis of 29 studies discussed above, for example, a subgroup analysis suggested that the prolonged infusions of penicillins, including piperacillin-tazobactam, were associated with a mortality benefit whereas prolonged infusions of cephalosporins or carbapenems were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Nevertheless, outcomes appear at least comparable between prolonged and intermittent infusions of cephalosporins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42557237\"><span class=\"h3\">Piperacillin-tazobactam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several, mainly observational studies have demonstrated the efficacy of extended infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> for gram-negative infections and have suggested that they are associated with at least equivalent, if not superior, outcomes as with standard, intermittent infusions. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized trials and nine observational studies, prolonged infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with a higher clinical cure rate (nine studies, OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.29-2.73) and a lower mortality rate (11 studies, OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.89) compared with intermittent infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, heterogeneity between comparison groups and limitations inherent in observational studies decrease confidence in the findings of many of these studies. </p><p>The following studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single center, retrospective study of critically ill adult patients with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection, 102 patients who were treated with an extended infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> (3.375 grams infused over 4 hours every 8 hours) were compared to a historical group of 92 patients who received intermittent infusions (3.375 grams infused over 30 minutes every 6 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolonged-infusions-of-beta-lactam-antibiotics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].
