The incidence of CEP in an Icelandic registry was 0.23 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/100,000</span> population per year between 1990 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In registries of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in Europe, CEP accounted for 0 to 2.5 percent of cases of ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Women develop CEP about twice as often as men. A majority of patients are nonsmokers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265678222\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CEP typically affects patients in their 30s or 40s, although onset in childhood has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. A history of atopy is found in 60 percent. Asthma precedes, accompanies, or subsequently occurs in over 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The disease has a gradual onset, with an interval of approximately four to five months between the appearance of initial symptoms and diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Typical symptoms include a productive cough (33 to 42 percent), fever (67 percent), breathlessness (57 to 92 percent), weight loss (57 to 75 percent), and night sweats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. </p><p>On physical examination, auscultatory findings of wheezing are noted in 35 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> crackles in 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Peripheral blood eosinophilia is commonly present (differential cell count mean eosinophils 32.3 percent, range 4.4 to 79, total blood eosinophils usually <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1000/&mu;L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. The normal eosinophil count in peripheral blood ranges between 0.05 and 0.5 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> (50 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL)</span>.

Total immunoglobulin E (IgE) is elevated (mean 506 <span class=\"nowrap\">kU/L</span> or approximately 1214 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> in approximately 50 percent. A high sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, iron deficiency anemia, and thrombocytosis are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265678517\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CEP is typically suspected in a patient with progressive dyspnea over one to four months and a chest radiograph showing bilateral peripheral or pleural-based opacities. Among the first steps in the evaluation is to inquire whether the patient is taking or has recently taken any of the drugs associated with pulmonary eosinophilia or has resided in an area with an increased likelihood of exposure to endemic parasite or fungi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76875 \">table 1</a>).

However, in the evaluation of patients with dyspnea, cough, and pulmonary radiographic opacities, the usual laboratory tests include a complete blood count and differential, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hepatic function tests, and urinalysis. As noted above, most patients (88 to 95 percent) will have peripheral blood eosinophilia (&gt;6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>].</p><p>In most series, sputum eosinophilia was present in less than half the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Certain laboratory tests are helpful to evaluate for diseases in the differential diagnosis (eg, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA, Churg Strauss]), including total serum IgE, IgG antibodies to <em>Aspergillus,</em> and an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test. However, ANCA is only positive in 40 to 60 percent of patients with EGPA, so a negative test doesn't exclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)&quot;, section on 'Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265678727\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are obtained in most ambulatory adults being evaluated for CEP based on symptoms (eg, dyspnea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cough) or peripheral blood eosinophilia. As many patients with CEP have a history of asthma, PFTs should include spirometry before and after inhaled bronchodilator in addition to lung volumes and diffusing capacity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In CEP, PFTs may show an obstructive or restrictive pattern, or may be normal, and thus are more helpful in assessing the degree of respiratory impairment than in guiding the diagnosis. The initial PFTs also provide a helpful baseline for monitoring response to treatment. In a case series of 62 patients, spirometry showed an obstructive pattern in 36 percent and a restrictive pattern in 32 percent. Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was decreased in approximately half the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a separate series of 19 patients, spirometry revealed an obstructive pattern in four (21 percent), restrictive in nine (47 percent), and normal in six (32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265678285\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The finding of bilateral peripheral or pleural-based, nonsegmental, consolidative opacities described as the &quot;photographic negative&quot; of pulmonary edema is highly suggestive of CEP when seen on chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86465\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86465 \">image 1</a>)&nbsp;or high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86464\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86464 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. However, the &quot;photographic negative&quot; pattern on the chest radiograph is present in only one-fourth of patients and is not specific for CEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/2,9,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,14,16</a>]. Additional imaging features that are common in CEP include an upper lung zone location of the opacities in approximately 50 percent and migratory opacities in 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An air bronchogram may be present on HRCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Less common HRCT abnormalities include ground glass opacities, nodules, cavities, and reticulation. </p><p>While certain HRCT findings are strongly suggestive of CEP (eg, peripheral, nonsegmental opacities), substantial overlap exists between the imaging findings of the various eosinophilic lung diseases. As an example, in a series that included 40 patients with CEP, the HRCT correctly identified 78 percent of the CEP cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, in an expanded series that included these cases, considerable overlap was noted in the HRCT findings of the various eosinophilic lung diseases (EGPA, ABPA, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>A pleural effusion is uncommon and observed in less than 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265678339\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with analysis of the cellular differential is performed in the majority of patients to identify eosinophilia and to exclude infection. The BAL sample is typically obtained in an area of radiographic opacity and sent for cell count, microbiologic studies, and cytology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of bronchoalveolar lavage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage-in-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The BAL eosinophil count is almost always greater than 25 percent in CEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5,12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,19</a>]; in one study, the mean BAL eosinophil proportion was 58 percent and more than 80 percent of patients had a BAL eosinophil count &gt;40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Only rarely is eosinophilia absent in the BAL. When this happens, a lung biopsy is required for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. BAL eosinophilia may be associated with increased neutrophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Although transbronchial lung biopsy may show characteristic features of eosinophilic pneumonia, it is uncommonly performed because the small size of the specimen usually precludes making a definitive pattern diagnosis (see below). (See <a href=\"#H15860953\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of lung biopsy in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;, section on 'Transbronchial lung biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15860953\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical lung biopsy is rarely needed to secure a diagnosis of CEP. When lung histopathology is obtained, interstitial and alveolar eosinophils and histiocytes, including multinucleated giant cells, are characteristic. Organizing pneumonia is a common associated finding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77554\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77554 \">picture 2</a>); interstitial fibrosis is minimal. Eosinophilic abscesses may also be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>In a series of 62 patients with CEP, four underwent surgical lung biopsy and eight had one or more transbronchial biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Among patients who required surgical biopsy, the histopathology showed both an interstitial and an alveolar exudate with eosinophils. Two biopsies had findings of organizing pneumonia and an eosinophilic infiltrate in the walls of small blood vessels, but without necrosis. Five of the transbronchial biopsies showed interstitial eosinophilic infiltrates and three showed alveolar exudates. Among patients who had endobronchial biopsies, a submucosal eosinophilic infiltrate was noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265678228\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CEP is typically based on the combination of clinical presentation, chest imaging showing predominantly peripheral or pleural-based, mid to upper lung zone opacities, and a bronchoalveolar lavage showing eosinophilia (&ge;25 percent). Surgical lung biopsy is generally not necessary unless the BAL does not show eosinophilia, the radiographic features are atypical, or the patient does not respond promptly to systemic glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H265678285\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H265678339\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopy'</a> above.) </p><p>Other potential causes of eosinophilic pneumonia, such as infection, drugs, and vasculitis, should be excluded, as described below.

However, the radiographic opacities in ABPA are more typically those of bronchiectasis (eg, &quot;tram-tracking&quot; or more centrally located mucus plugging &quot;finger-in-glove&quot;). The diagnosis of ABPA is based on a serum IgE level &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L,</span> a positive specific IgG to <em>Aspergillus</em>, and a positive prick skin test to <em>Aspergillus</em> antigen.

EGPA is more likely to have extrapulmonary manifestations (eg, skin, heart, kidney). However, an overlap between CEP and EGPA has been noted with the suggestion that CEP may be a presenting feature of EGPA.

Thereafter, the dose is reduced to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and continued for another four weeks. If there is documented sustained improvement, the dose is tapered by 5 mg every two to three weeks to the previous dose that maintained complete control of the disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265679096\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of maintenance therapy is to control the disease with the smallest required dose of oral glucocorticoids in order to limit treatment-related side effects. Formal study is lacking regarding the optimal duration of treatment, but because relapses are common, treatment is typically maintained for at least three months, and usually for six to nine months. Occasionally, glucocorticoid therapy is continued indefinitely.</p><p>Approximately four to six weeks after starting oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and after symptoms and plain chest radiographic abnormalities have resolved, prednisone dose can be decreased by 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (or equivalent) and continued at that dose for another eight weeks.</p><p>Subsequently, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> can be reduced at 5 mg decrements every four weeks until complete cessation of therapy (in the absence of recurrent symptoms or radiographic abnormalities). An alternate&ndash;day regimen can also be used for tapering when the prednisone dose is &le;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. </p><p>Although the dose and length of therapy will vary for individual patients, an attempt to stop therapy is reasonable after six to nine months, as about one quarter of patients will tolerate glucocorticoid discontinuation at that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One study found that three-fourths of patients required prolonged glucocorticoid therapy, with a mean initial duration of 19 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other studies have also documented that the majority of patients require long-term oral glucocorticoid treatment (one or more years) and a few require lifelong therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/2,5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,26</a>]. Attempts are made to reduce the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose to the lowest amount that will control the disease; use of alternate-day oral prednisone may help reduce the adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15860787\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential alternative therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative therapies have been explored for patients with recurrent flares of CEP that are associated with radiographic opacities, including high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> (monoclonal antibody to IgE).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inhaled glucocorticoids</strong> &ndash; Inhaled glucocorticoids (1000 to 1500 mcg per 24 hours) have been reported to be effective in CEP, although studies are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-eosinophilic-pneumonia/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].

CEP is characterized by the onset of dyspnea, cough, fever, and wheezing over three weeks to several months. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H265678222\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest imaging findings of bilateral peripheral or pleural-based opacities, described as the &quot;photographic negative&quot; of pulmonary edema, are virtually pathognomonic for CEP, although not all patients manifest this pattern. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is commonly present. (See <a href=\"#H265678285\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution computed tomography of the lungs&quot;, section on 'HRCT disease distribution'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed in the majority of patients to look for eosinophilia and to exclude infection. In CEP, the BAL almost always shows eosinophilia greater than 25 percent. (See <a href=\"#H265678339\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CEP is typically based on the combination of clinical presentation, chest imaging showing predominantly peripheral or pleural-based opacities, and a bronchoalveolar lavage cell count showing eosinophilia (&ge;25 percent). Infections and drug-induced pulmonary eosinophilia need to be excluded. Lung biopsy is not necessary unless the BAL does not show eosinophilia, the chest imaging features are atypical, or the patient does not respond promptly to systemic glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H265678228\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of CEP includes acute eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia due to drug toxicity, infection (eg, fungal or parasitic), or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg Strauss), and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H265678234\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a diagnosis of CEP has been made and alternative causes of eosinophilic infiltration of the lung excluded (particularly drug-induced and infectious causes), we recommend initiation of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, as CEP rarely resolves spontaneously (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the majority of patients we initiate therapy with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, or the equivalent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with rapidly progressive CEP (especially if associated with respiratory failure), we typically use high dose intravenous glucocorticoid therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 60 to 125 mg every six hours) for three to five days prior to transitioning to oral therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subjective and radiographic improvement usually starts within 48 hours of initiating therapy. We continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for two weeks after the complete resolution of symptoms and plain chest radiographic abnormalities (usually four to six weeks into therapy). At that time, the dose can be decreased by one-half (0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) and therapy continued for another eight weeks. (See <a href=\"#H265678894\" class=\"local\">'Assessing the response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At follow-up visits, we monitor symptoms, physical examination, peripheral blood eosinophil counts, pulmonary function tests, pulse oxygen saturation, and chest radiograph. (See <a href=\"#H265678894\" class=\"local\">'Assessing the response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal duration of therapy is not known. After about 12 to 14 weeks, we usually taper <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> by 5 mg increments every four weeks as tolerated until complete cessation of therapy or a disease flare. Most patients require prolonged treatment (ie, more than six months) and up to three-fourths of patients will require ongoing therapy for several years.
