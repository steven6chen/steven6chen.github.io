People with insomnia have trouble falling or staying asleep, or they do not feel rested when they wake up. Insomnia is not about the number of hours of sleep a person gets. Everyone needs a different amount of sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17011181\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of insomnia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with insomnia often:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble falling or staying asleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel tired or sleepy during the day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forget things or have trouble thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get cranky, anxious, irritable, or depressed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have less energy or interest in doing things</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make mistakes or get into accidents more often than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worry about their lack of sleep</p><p/><p>These symptoms can be so bad that they affect a person's relationships or work life. Plus, they can happen even in people who seem to be sleeping enough hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17011190\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Most people with insomnia need no tests. Your doctor or nurse will probably be able to tell what is wrong just by talking to you. He or she might also ask you to keep a daily log for 1 to 2 weeks, where you keep track of how you sleep each night.</p><p>In some cases, people do need special sleep tests, such as &quot;polysomnography&quot; or &quot;actigraphy.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polysomnography &ndash; Polysomnography is a test that usually lasts all night and that is done in a sleep lab. During the test, monitors are attached to your body to record movement, brain activity, breathing, and other body functions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Actigraphy &ndash; Actigraphy records activity and movement with a monitor or motion detector that is usually worn on the wrist. The test is done at home, over several days and nights. It will record how much you actually sleep and when.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17011140\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to improve my insomnia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can follow good &quot;sleep hygiene.&quot; That means that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep only long enough to feel rested and then get out of bed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Go to bed and get up at the same time every day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not try to force yourself to sleep. If you can't sleep, get out of bed and try again later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have coffee, tea, and other foods that have caffeine only in the morning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol in the late afternoon, evening, and bedtime</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoking, especially in the evening</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your bedroom dark, cool, quiet, and free of reminders of work or other things that cause you stress</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solve problems you have before you go to bed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise several days a week, but not right before bed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid looking at phones or reading devices (&quot;e-books&quot;) that give off light before bed. This can make it harder to fall asleep.</p><p/><p>Other things that can improve sleep include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation therapy, in which you focus on relaxing all the muscles in your body 1 by 1</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working with a counselor or psychologist to deal with the problems that might be causing poor sleep</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17011217\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have insomnia, and it is troubling you, see your doctor or nurse. He or she might have suggestions on how to fix the problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17011147\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there medicines to help me sleep?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there are medicines to help with sleep. But you should try them only after you try the techniques described above. You also should not use sleep medicines every night for long periods of time. Otherwise, you can become dependent on them for sleep.</p><p>Insomnia is sometimes caused by mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety. If that's the case for you, you might benefit from an antidepressant rather than a sleep aid. Antidepressants often improve sleep and can help with other worries, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17011154\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I use alcohol to help me sleep?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, do not use alcohol as a sleep aid. Even though alcohol makes you sleepy at first, it disrupts sleep later in the night.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17011264\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Restless legs syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=daytime-sleepiness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Daytime sleepiness (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jet-lag-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Jet lag (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-a-sleep-study-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What is a sleep study?
