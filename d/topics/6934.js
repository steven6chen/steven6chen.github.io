Small cell carcinoma is the preferred terminology, but these tumors have also been referred to as oat cell carcinoma or sarcoma, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, small cell tumor, anaplastic cell carcinoma, microcytoma, reserve cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, Kulchitsky cell carcinoma, and carcinoma with amine precursor uptake decarboxylation (APUD) cell differentiation. These tumors are thought to originate from totipotent stem cells present in all tissues, although some small cell carcinomas may arise from more well-differentiated tumors.</p><p>Extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (ESCCs) are extremely rare; these tumors have been described most frequently in the urinary bladder, prostate, esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, gallbladder, larynx, salivary glands, cervix, and skin. In addition, small cell carcinoma will occasionally present with metastatic disease, and a primary site cannot be identified (small cell carcinoma of unknown primary).</p><p>The diverse origin of these ESCCs is illustrated by a study of 120 patients, in which the site of origin was the female genital tract (26 percent), gastrointestinal tract (23 percent), genitourinary tract (19 percent), head and neck (16 percent), unknown primary site (13 percent), and other sites (4.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similar findings have been reported by other groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Although extrapulmonary undifferentiated large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are distinct histologically, the natural history of such lesions is similar to that of ESCC, and the treatment approach is the same. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H4047701511\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>The key features and general management of ESCCs will be reviewed here, followed by a discussion of ESCCs that arise in relatively more common sites. ESCCs arising in the tubular gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas, cervix, urinary bladder, and with an unknown primary are discussed separately, as is Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin, which is included in the differential diagnosis of these tumors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small cell carcinoma of the bladder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroendocrine neoplasms of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of Merkel cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF ESCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ESCCs have an aggressive natural history that is characterized by early, widespread metastases. Although some patients who present with locoregional disease may be cured by aggressive therapy, most relapse and the overall prognosis is poor, with less than 15 percent reaching five-year survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In different studies, the median survival for limited and extensive disease ranges from 1.4 to 3.5 years and 8 to 12 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Patients may have local relapse or distant metastases at relapse. In one series of 159 patients, 22 patients (13 percent) had local recurrence, 49 (31 percent) had distant metastases, and 20 (13 percent) had both local and distant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The liver was the most common site of metastatic disease; only four patients (2.5 percent) had brain metastases at the time of first relapse.</p><p>The initial clinical manifestations are often due to locoregional disease, and the presenting symptoms may be indistinguishable from other tumors arising in the same site. ESCCs also can present with symptoms from distant metastases or with paraneoplastic syndromes, as occurs with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risk factors, pathology, and clinical manifestations of lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Paraneoplastic phenomena'</a>.)</p><p>A variety of laboratory abnormalities have been reported with ESCC. Immunohistochemistry for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) in concert with synaptophysin may help to differentiate ESCC from poorly differentiated carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, paraneoplastic syndromes can result in hyponatremia, hypokalemia, or hypercalcemia, any of which may require specific treatment. Tumor-associated neuroendocrine markers have been elevated in some cases, although it is generally not useful to measure or monitor these proteins.</p><p>ESCCs have the same histologic appearance as SCLC regardless of their site of origin. In most cases, electron microscopy can identify neurosecretory granules that establish the neuroendocrine origin of the tumor, but the absence of such granules does not rule out ESCC. ESCCs are often found in conjunction with other tumor types, and the presence of a small cell component usually determines the biologic aggressiveness of a tumor. The histopathology of SCLC is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H1176454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Neuroendocrine tumors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of a patient with ESCC should include evaluation of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes to assess the extent of locoregional disease, and computed tomography (CT) of the chest to rule out a primary SCLC.</p><p>Prior to treatment, patients should be evaluated to determine whether or not distant metastases are present. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful in the staging and treatment response of ESCC and should be considered in the initial staging of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, in one study of 33 patients with ESCC, PET scans influenced management in 19 percent of 43 imaging studies. Other imaging procedures that can be useful include abdominal and pelvic CT scans and bone scan.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is recommended if neurologic symptoms are present. Bone marrow biopsy is indicated only if there are abnormal blood counts or findings on the peripheral smear, without other evidence of disseminated disease. Based on the results of such evaluation, patients with disease confined to a primary site <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regional nodes are classified as having limited disease, while all others are considered to have extensive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of patients with locoregional disease is patterned after that for other tumor types arising in the same extrapulmonary site. In general, this includes surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy. Despite aggressive locoregional treatment, relapse is common and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is generally recommended. There are no randomized clinical trials or prospective clinical studies, and this approach is based upon case reports and extrapolation from the experience with SCLC. Most patients develop metastatic disease despite adjuvant therapy, and the prognosis is poor.</p><p>The treatment of systemic disease with chemotherapy is based upon that used in SCLC, typically a platinum-based regimen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>. Objective responses are common, but most are partial and of short duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Amrubicin monotherapy has been noted to be effective as salvage therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a> shows only modest activity in pretreated ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extensive stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory and relapsed small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prognosis for patients with disseminated disease is poor despite chemotherapy and, in general, is similar to that for patients with extensive SCLC. However, two reports noted that patients with ESCC had a worse response rate, medial survival, and prognosis compared with patients with SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This may be especially true for patients with ESCC of the hepatobiliary tract and pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and those with poor performance status and liver involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. By contrast, in another series patients with ESCC had a better three-year survival than those with SCLC (19 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Breast ESCC had the best three-year survival (60 percent) and gastrointestinal the worst (7 percent). The choice of chemotherapy regimen, duration of treatment, role of maintenance therapy, and retreatment following relapse in patients are discussed elsewhere.</p><p>In general, prophylactic cranial irradiation is not recommended because there appears to be a decreased incidence of brain metastases in ESCC compared with SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. In a review of 280 patients with ESCC treated over a 12-year period, only 18 patients (6 percent) developed brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, prostate and head and neck ESCC have been reported to have a higher frequency of brain metastases; 16 to 19 percent and 41 percent, respectively. Thus, prophylactic cranial radiation can be considered in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PROSTATE ESCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pure ESCC arising in the prostate is a rare disorder that is distinct from the far more common prostatic adenocarcinoma. Clinical, prognostic, and management considerations for high-grade, low-prostate-specific antigen (PSA) prostate cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-risk-stratification-and-choice-of-initial-treatment#H25308876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment&quot;, section on 'High-grade, low-PSA disease'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103824542\"><span class=\"h1\">GALLBLADDER ESCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ESCC accounts for between 1 and 5 percent of malignancies arising in the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The epidemiology of gallbladder ESCC is similar to that of adenocarcinoma, suggesting common etiologic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. In a series of 53 patients, small cell carcinoma was twice as common in women, the median age at diagnosis was 64 years, and two-thirds had coexisting cholelithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients typically present with a large tumor mass that is indistinguishable from other tumors arising in the gallbladder. The symptoms and findings on physical examination are secondary to the presence of a mass or obstruction of the biliary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>]. In addition, gallbladder ESCC may be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes. Laboratory features are nonspecific and reflect obstruction of the biliary tract. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The microscopic findings are similar to those of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In some cases, ESCC is found in conjunction with adenocarcinoma or other histologic types of gallbladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Tumors with mixed histology are consistent with the hypothesis that ESCC arises either from a totipotent stem cell or within foci of more differentiated tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H1176454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Neuroendocrine tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Abdominal ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for biliary tract disease. The mass may obstruct the biliary tree as well as the vessels of porta hepatis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Computed tomography (CT), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and angiography can also be useful in staging and treatment planning, although laparotomy is often required to obtain tissue for a diagnosis and define the extent of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Prior to treatment, patients should be evaluated to rule out a primary SCLC or evidence of distant metastases (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of ESCC'</a> above). There is no specific staging system for gallbladder ESCC; tumors should be staged according to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'TNM staging system'</a>.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H737132087\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all gallbladder ESCCs are either locally advanced or metastatic at diagnosis, and the prognosis is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. In a series of 53 cases from the literature, those with disseminated disease had a median survival of eight months, and one- and two-year survival rates of 28 and 0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In patients with localized disease, surgical resection may result in prolonged survival in occasional patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, the development of distant metastases in most patients has led to the use of systemic chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Chemotherapy is also used in the treatment for disseminated disease. Although there are no clinical trials of different regimens, the choice of systemic therapy is based upon the experience in SCLC.

The epidemiology and risk factors for laryngeal ESCC are similar to that for other laryngeal tumors. Most patients are between the ages of 60 and 80, and there is a slight male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Smoking, chewing tobacco, and excess alcohol intake have been associated with ESCC of the larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features of laryngeal ESCC are similar to those of other laryngeal tumors and are due to the presence of a laryngeal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Cervical lymph node metastases are often the initial site of tumor spread, and the origin of the tumor in the larynx only becomes apparent when the patient later presents with hoarseness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a review of 66 cases, cervical lymph node involvement was present in 35 (53 percent) at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, some patients have symptoms from paraneoplastic syndromes.

In addition to small cell carcinoma, large cell poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H1176454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Neuroendocrine tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Although most tumors are composed of pure ESCC, some have elements of squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. These composite tumors are thought to arise in a common totipotent stem cell that can differentiate into various cell types.</p><p>The differentiation of ESCC from other laryngeal tumors requires biopsy and histologic examination of the tumor.

Although occasional long-term survivors have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], the local recurrence rate is high, especially when disease is present in the cervical lymph nodes, and distant metastases are almost always seen.

There is no separate staging classification for ESCC of the salivary glands, and these tumors are staged according to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110657\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110657 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110617\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110617 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions regarding therapy are largely based upon experience with other salivary gland tumors and anecdotal case reports. For patients who present without evidence of metastatic disease, surgical resection of the tumor, along with regional lymph node dissection, is the preferred treatment. Postoperative radiation therapy (RT) has been used to improve local control, although there are no trials documenting its efficacy.</p><p>Despite local treatment, most patients relapse with distant disease. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy has been used with platinum-based regimens. Metastatic disease, whether present at diagnosis or developing after treatment of the primary tumor, is managed with systemic chemotherapy. Chemotherapy regimens are based upon those used for patients with SCLC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extensive stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When compared with ESCCs arising in the larynx and other sites, those originating in salivary glands appear to have a better prognosis. In a retrospective analysis of 20 patients, the two- and five-year survival rates were 70 and 46 percent, respectively, compared with 16 and 5 percent for laryngeal small cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This may be due to early recognition of salivary gland abnormalities because of their superficial location, thereby permitting earlier diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small cell carcinoma is a distinct clinicopathologic entity that usually arises in the lung but can also originate in a wide range of extrapulmonary sites. These tumors are thought to originate from totipotent stem cells present in all tissues, although some small cell carcinomas may arise from more well-differentiated tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (ESCCs) are extremely rare; these tumors have been described most frequently in the urinary bladder, prostate, esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, gallbladder, larynx, salivary glands, cervix, and skin. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of ESCC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the initial clinical manifestations are often due to locoregional disease, ESCCs have an aggressive natural history that is characterized by early, widespread metastases. Although some patients who present with locoregional disease may be cured by aggressive therapy, most relapse and the overall prognosis is poor. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of ESCC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of patients with ESCCs should include evaluation of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes to assess the extent of locoregional disease and computed tomography (CT) of the chest to rule out a primary small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Prior to treatment, patients should be evaluated to determine whether or not distant metastases are present. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of patients with locoregional disease is patterned after that for other tumor types arising in the same extrapulmonary site. Despite aggressive locoregional treatment, relapse is common and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is generally recommended, although all data are derived from case reports and no randomized clinical trials have been conducted. Despite adjuvant therapy, most patients develop metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of systemic disease with chemotherapy is patterned after the approach used in SCLC and generally utilizes a combination of a platinum compound and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>. Although objective responses are commonly observed, most are partial and of short duration.
