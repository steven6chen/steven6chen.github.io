Vestibular vertigo may arise from peripheral lesions (eg, labyrinth or vestibular nerve) or central lesions (eg, brainstem or cerebellum). Appropriate management of vertigo requires the correct diagnosis. This includes identifying the origin of dizziness as a problem with the vestibular system and then determining the site and origin of that problem.</p><p>This topic will review the management of the patient with vertigo. Distinguishing vertigo from other types of dizziness, determining the cause of vertigo, and the differential diagnosis of vertigo are discussed separately.

Benzodiazepines can be sedating and are used when antihistamines are not adequately effective. The phenothiazine antiemetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a>) are also more sedating and usually reserved for patients with severe vomiting. </p><p>Other than sedation, which can be dose-limiting, side effects are generally minimal. Extrapyramidal symptoms are a risk with phenothiazine antiemetics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> but less so with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a>, a peripheral dopaminergic antagonist that does not cross the blood brain barrier. </p><p>Symptomatic treatments should be stopped as soon as possible after severe symptoms and vomiting cease (usually within one or two days) to avoid compromising long-term adaptation to vestibular loss by the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some studies in animal models have shown that use of these medications (benzodiazepines and antiemetics, in particular) are associated with impaired central vestibular compensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">VESTIBULAR REHABILITATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456583698\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in humans and animal models have shown that clinical recovery after peripheral vestibular injury occurs in advance of improved peripheral vestibular function, suggesting that most of the early recovery and a substantial portion of the total recovery derives from central nervous system compensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. This central compensation appears to be multisensory in its scope and is the primary target of vestibular rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There is some evidence that early rehabilitation is more effective than late intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Vestibular rehabilitation (physical therapy) promotes recovery in patients with permanent unilateral or bilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. It is not known whether vestibular rehabilitation is useful for central vestibular disorders, although preliminary evidence suggests that it might have benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Referral can be arranged through most physiotherapy departments or dizzy clinics.</p><p>Most patients with vertigo prefer to lie with their head still. Vestibular rehabilitation forces them to perform challenging balance exercises with several potential benefits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activity promotes adaptation &mdash; The brain can readjust or adapt its responses to take into account reduced vestibular input, particularly if one side is still normal. This is optimally accomplished when the brain has experience with vision during head motion, to determine how much error the lesion has introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activity facilitates strategic substitution &mdash; There are other means of reducing spatial uncertainty, even if the vestibular system cannot recover. The cervico-ocular reflex can increase its input, and other eye movements can help stabilize gaze [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Alternative spatial cues from vision and proprioception can improve balance and walking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactivity has secondary negative effects &mdash; Patients may become physically deconditioned, which exacerbates the inadequacy of their postural reflexes. They may also become psychologically deconditioned, sometimes to the point where a &quot;persistent postural-perceptual dizziness&quot; (also called phobic postural vertigo, chronic subjective dizziness) becomes the greatest obstacle to their recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Fear of falling is particularly problematic in the elderly after a vestibular event, and it can limit mobility indefinitely without a rehabilitation program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456583686\"><span class=\"h2\">Cause-specific efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vestibular exercises have been used for 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, they have only more recently been studied in randomized, controlled trials. Limitations of these studies include that they are unblinded with short-term follow-up. The evidence of their benefit is most robust for unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There is not sufficient evidence to determine whether one form of rehabilitation is more effective than another.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute peripheral vertigo</strong> &mdash; The exercises commonly provided for persons with acute vestibular events include focusing on an object with a blank background and moving the head slowly to the right and left. The exercise is done in the pitch <span class=\"nowrap\">(up/down)</span> and yaw <span class=\"nowrap\">(left/right)</span> planes. Shortly after a vestibular injury the patient is encouraged to move his or her head slowly to avoid severe nausea. Then the speed is increased as the patient tolerates. Most patients are asked to perform these exercises two to three times each day for several minutes.<br/><br/>Two trials have shown that vestibular exercises begun shortly after the onset of acute unilateral vestibular hypofunction due to vestibular neuritis or vestibular surgery significantly improve balance at one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. It is not known whether the improvements persist beyond one month.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic peripheral vertigo</strong> &mdash; The exercises recommended for persons with chronic peripheral vertigo are generally much more aggressive than those for persons with acute disorders. Patients are asked to perform eye and head movements while standing, walking forward, walking backward, and while standing or walking on compliant or uneven surfaces. The focus of the program is to perform increasingly more difficult postural tasks with increasingly more eye and head movements while keeping symptoms manageable.<br/><br/>A study of patients with chronic dizziness for at least six months duration due to unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction found that dizziness improved with either vestibular therapy or drugs, but improved balance occurred only in the group receiving physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].<br/><br/>Treatment with home exercises may be as effective as supervised outpatient therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Two randomized controlled trials of patients with chronic peripheral vestibular disorders in general practice evaluated a standard home vestibular program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Treated patients had significant improvement on all primary outcome measures (dizziness, dizziness-related quality of life, and postural stability) compared with the control groups at three and six months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A limitation of these studies is that participants could not be blinded to treatment status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bilateral vestibular injury</strong> &mdash; Complete bilateral loss of vestibular function reduces the possibility of adaptation, and patients often do not improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nevertheless, exercises may promote strategic substitutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Saccadic eye exercises and exercises that attempt to optimize the efficacy of neck stretch receptors are emphasized in persons with bilateral vestibular loss. If there is a possibility that the patient has any remaining vestibular function, a trial of vestibuloocular exercises is initiated as well.<br/><br/>Education about fall prevention is critical for persons with bilateral loss, as they have a particularly high fall risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Darkness and uneven surfaces will provide additional challenges for these patients.<br/><br/>A double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that physical therapy improved balance and gait speed in eight patients with bilateral vestibular injury, despite continued impairment of vestibular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central vertigo</strong> &mdash; Persons with central vestibular abnormalities often have constant symptoms. Gait and balance activities are emphasized along with eye and head movements. Most patients are instructed to perform these exercises two to three times per week. Nausea may be limiting; the use of medications in conjunction with physical therapy may improve participation and final outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Adaptive methods to perform functional activities are often taught. Persons with central vestibular disorders take longer to improve than those with peripheral vestibular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. For central disorders, only observational, uncontrolled reports are available to support the use of vestibular rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p/><p>In summary, most agree that vestibular exercises can improve dizziness and postural confidence in the short term. Ideally, exercise regimens should begin immediately after symptom onset because of evidence of a critical period of adaptation and compensation that are seen in animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/5,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,38</a>]. We refer our patients to therapists trained in vestibular rehabilitation to develop customized exercise programs.</p><p>Further studies are needed to determine whether the gains obtained from vestibular rehabilitation are maintained in the long term, and whether such long-term gains are significant and relevant in regard to decreasing the risk of falls, improving gait, and promoting normal lifestyles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18900637\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychiatric comorbidity is common in patients with vertigo. In one cross-sectional study, psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in more than forty percent of patients with a diagnosed condition producing vertigo and were a significant contributor to disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vertigo/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity (in particular, anxiety, somatoform, affective disorders) was higher for some conditions (eg, 50 percent in vestibular migraine) than others (eg, 37 percent for vestibular neuritis). While the effects of psychiatric treatment have not been specifically studied, it is reasonable to consider psychiatric treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referral for patients with prominent psychiatric symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
