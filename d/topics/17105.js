The clinical and serologic evaluation, which allows for the transfusion of the most compatible (or &quot;least incompatible&quot;) blood, requires a joint effort between the clinician and the transfusion medicine physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>However, there are times when all available resources are exhausted and a unit of blood that is not crossmatch compatible must be issued to the patient. The most common of these clinical situations as well as suggestions on how safely to issue and transfuse the best unit of blood available will be reviewed here. General discussions of crossmatching procedures and red cell antigens are presented separately.

If negative results are obtained, the patient may be safely transfused with ABO and Rh compatible blood, since the patient has no clinically significant RBC antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion#H1449669\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of pretransfusion testing results'</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, if a positive test is found with one or more of the screening cells, an antibody identification test is indicated to evaluate the identity of the antibody. This involves testing the patient's plasma against a panel of 10 or more phenotyped RBCs. This usually results in identification of the RBC antibody in the patient's plasma. Compatible blood may then be selected that lacks the corresponding antigen(s).</p><p>At times, the patient's plasma reacts with all of the RBCs on the panel (panagglutination), resulting in incompatible crossmatches with all of the donor blood available, making antibody identification and selection of compatible blood complicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Thresholds for transfusion are discussed in detail separately. However, the use of thresholds is not appropriate in patients with active bleeding whose blood loss outpaces serial hemoglobin measurements; clinical judgment must be used regarding the urgency of transfusion in such settings.

In critical situations other options may be available. These are described separately.

If the patient has never been exposed to any foreign RBCs in the past, it is highly unlikely that an alloantibody could be present. With this vital information, transfusion can proceed more quickly with ABO matched blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The remainder of the work-up can be completed after issue of the unit of blood.</p><p>For patients who require urgent or emergent transfusion, joint decision making by the clinician and transfusion medicine physician should occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Importantly, <strong>no patient should be denied a lifesaving transfusion because of difficulties in finding compatible blood</strong>.</p><p>For patients with an urgent need for transfusion, blood can be issued under a non-standard release that is approved by a physician. Patients with a confirmed ABO type can receive uncrossmatched, type-specific blood, and patients without an available ABO type can receive type O blood.</p><p>Massive transfusion is a special case of <span class=\"nowrap\">urgent/emergency</span> transfusion in a patient with a massive hemorrhage, in which predetermined blood ordering protocols are used to provide sufficient numbers of RBC units and other blood components. Many institutions have massive transfusion protocols for specific clinical settings such as labor and delivery. This subject is discussed in detail separately.

Particular difficulty in providing compatible blood is encountered when such patients form either multiple alloantibodies or an antibody to a high frequency RBC antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Common alloantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whenever the antibody screening test is positive, the blood bank will perform studies to identify the specificity of the offending antibody or antibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53831 \">figure 1</a>). The most common alloantibodies detected are anti-E, anti-Le(a), anti-K, anti-D, and anti-Le(b) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Only antibodies that are capable of causing a hemolytic transfusion reaction or hemolytic disease of the newborn are considered clinically significant. Fortunately not all alloantibodies are clinically important. The following is a list of the common alloantibodies and their clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies that are ALWAYS considered to be potentially clinically significant include: ABO (A, B), Rh (D, C, c, E, e), Duffy (Fya, Fyb), Kidd (Jka, Jkb), Kell (K, k), SsU (S, s, U), and Lutheran (Lub)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies that are rarely or never considered to be clinically significant include: Lewis (Lea, Leb), MN, Lutheran (Lua), P1, Xga, Cartwright (Yta), Bg, York (Yka), <span class=\"nowrap\">Chido/Rodgers</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Cha/Rga),</span> Sda, and HTLA (high titer low avidity)</p><p/><p>In four series, the most frequent clinically significant alloantibodies encountered included anti-E, anti-K, anti-c, anti-Jk(a), and anti-Fy(a) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/9,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Alloantibody persistence and evanescence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of importance, the titer of some acquired alloantibodies decreases with time, often to the point of evanescence or complete disappearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This is a less common finding with antibodies directed against Rh antigens, but is frequent among those developing anti-Jk(a), consistent with the large relative number of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions mediated by anti-Jk(a). As an example, in a long-term study of the transfusion records of 304 male veterans with one or more alloantibodies and at least one follow-up alloantibody screening test, anti-D and anti-C alloantibodies were persistent in 94 and 86 percent, whereas anti-Jk(a) alloantibodies were persistent in only 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple alloantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial alloimmunization, 20 to 25 percent of non-hematology-oncology patients and 22 to 33 percent of hematology-oncology patients may develop additional red cell alloantibodies after subsequent transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18</a>].

Approximately 25 percent of adults and 10 percent of children with SCD have multiple alloantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This situation arises due to genetic differences among different ethnic populations in terms of the frequency of RBC antigens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78046\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78046 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Patients with SCD generally are African Americans, while most blood donors are Caucasians, resulting in unusually excessive exposure to certain antigens.

In order to avoid this situation, many hospital blood banks will phenotype the SCD patient's RBCs and provide blood that is matched for ABO, Rh, and Kell antigens (partially phenotypically matched RBCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

However, the mechanism of prevention of all alloantibody production by matching for only certain antigens is not well understood.</p><p>In our own experience over the past 10 years after we began providing ABO, Rh, and Kell antigen matched blood for non-alloimmunized patients with SCD, we have not seen a single new alloantibody in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Alloantibodies to high frequency antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High frequency antigens, such as U, Vel, k, Lu(b), and Yt(a) are present in more than 99.8 percent of the population.

Because these antigens are present on almost all donor RBCs, crossmatches will be positive with virtually all randomly selected units of blood. A family history of difficulty in finding compatible blood for transfusion is a valuable clue to this diagnosis.</p><p>Identification of antibodies to high frequency antigens requires rare reagent RBCs lacking these antigens. Such reagent RBCs are not available at the average hospital blood bank; a reference laboratory must be consulted in order to identify these rare antibodies.

If a patient is Type O Rh negative with anti-K, anti-Jk(b), and anti-Fy(a), in order to find one compatible unit of RBCs, the calculated theoretical chance is 0.006, or one out of 167 units (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55655 \">table 2</a>). In these situations, the hospital must work with the community blood center in order to obtain sufficient units of compatible blood for the patient.

Both tests are only available in reference laboratories. If the alloantibody is not clinically significant, multiple random units can be crossmatched with the patient's plasma. The most compatible units can be safely transfused. If the alloantibody is clinically significant, the following options are available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rare donor file may be contacted for compatible blood, usually via the regional blood center.

Importantly, no patient with autoantibodies should be denied a lifesaving transfusion because of difficulties in finding compatible blood for transfusion, because such patients are likely to tolerate serologically incompatible blood without significant complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is the most common type of AIHA. In one study, warm AIHA represented 70.3 percent of the cases of AIHA that were encountered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Warm AIHA can be idiopathic or secondary to the presence of an underlying disease, such as a lymphoproliferative, autoimmune, or immune deficiency disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, Coombs' test) will be positive in patients with AIHA, but this is a nonspecific test that can be positive in as many as 10 percent of hospitalized patients who do not have hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of autoantibodies. The incidence of true AIHA is 1 in 80,000 in most published reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The DAT is positive, due to coating of the patient's RBCs with complement components. Patients with this disorder suffer episodic anemia upon exposure to cold.

The presence of a masking autoantibody makes alloantibody detection and identification more difficult. As an example of their prevalence in this setting, one study indicated that 31 percent of subjects with a warm autoantibody also had at least one alloantibody. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Presence of alloantibodies'</a>.)</p><p>Several techniques can be used to detect an underlying alloantibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. The most powerful test is the autoadsorption method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68773\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68773 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/6,7,10,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10,31</a>]. The autoantibody coating the patient's RBCs is driven off the cells by an elution method. The patient's own eluted RBCs are then mixed with the patient's plasma. These cells will adsorb the autoantibodies from the plasma, but alloantibodies cannot be adsorbed since the patient does not have the corresponding antigen on his or her own RBCs. Mixing is continued multiple times until all of the autoantibody is removed from the plasma. If the patient has an alloantibody, it can now be detected and identified. There are, however, several drawbacks to this method:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It cannot be used in a recently transfused patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The autoantibody may be difficult to adsorb, either because the antibody titer is too high or the patient's RBCs are too fragile for any manipulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is very time consuming</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is often a requirement for more blood samples from an already anemic patient</p><p/><p>When autoadsorption is not possible, an alternate method called allogeneic adsorption is available by using allogeneic RBCs of varying phenotypes to adsorb autoantibody from the patient's plasma, leaving behind the alloantibody, if present, for subsequent identification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/6,7,31,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,31,34,35</a>]. Details of these methods are beyond the scope of this discussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of blood for transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The provision of blood for patients with cold-reacting antibodies may not present a major challenge as long as all testing and crossmatching is performed at 37&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>]. However, in warm AIHA the patient has autoantibodies which react at 37&deg;C and are panagglutinins directed against a common RBC antigen present on the patient's and virtually all RBCs. Therefore, it is impossible to provide &quot;crossmatch compatible&quot; blood for these patients. Fortunately, these patients generally tolerate transfusion of such incompatible blood without suffering serious hemolytic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/8,9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,36</a>].</p><p>Although the survival of these transfused RBCs is shortened, it is not significantly different from the survival of the patient's own RBCs. One report, for example, described 53 patients who received blood transfusions because of decompensated AIHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. No patient had a definite increase in hemolysis, even when the transfused RBCs were serologically incompatible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Presence of alloantibodies'</a>.)</p><p>In an effort to provide the greatest degree of compatibility, there are several approaches the laboratory can take:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crossmatch a number of units (10 to 20) and select the most compatible blood components (ie, among all the crossmatched units, select the units with the weakest positive reactions). This approach is especially useful in the situation where the patient is urgently in need of blood transfusion and no time is available to wait for a complete laboratory workup.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phenotype or genotype the patient's RBCs. If the patient's extended RBC phenotype is known, transfusion can be accomplished safely by providing phenotypically matched RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In most cases, this information is not available to the blood bank. If phenotyping is to be pursued, this should be done prior to the initial transfusion. Since the patient's RBCs are coated in vivo with autoantibody, techniques such as the EDTA-glycine acid method or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> method need to be employed to dissociate autoantibody from the patient's RBCs before phenotyping. If the patient's extended RBC phenotype is not known, partially phenotypically matched RBCs for Rh and Kell may be provided to reduce the risk of alloimmunization and delayed hemolytic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serologic transfusion reactions. Genotyping tests have become available in reference laboratories that can be performed on patients who have had recent transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The genotype provides an extended RBC antigen profile to select antigen-negative RBC units for transfusion. However, these techniques are not available in most hospital blood banks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform autoadsorption to remove autoantibodies from the patient's plasma and then use the adsorbed plasma to crossmatch donor RBC units. This is the best method for finding a compatible unit of blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68773\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68773 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'AIHA and concurrent alloantibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">In vivo crossmatch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vivo crossmatch procedures have been reported in the literature as a method for predicting the compatibility of individual units of blood for transfusion. Two techniques for performing an in vivo crossmatch have been reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One method involves the intravenous injection of 1.0 mL of 51Cr-labeled RBCs from the selected unit to be transfused. Radioactivity in the recipient's blood is measured at 10 and 60 minutes following the injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. If &gt;70 percent of the RBCs survive for the first 60 minutes, the unit of blood is considered to be compatible. This test is not available in most hospitals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second method involves the infusion of 20 to 30 mL of RBCs from the selected unit of blood. After waiting for approximately 30 minutes, during which time the patient is observed for signs and symptoms of a hemolytic transfusion reaction, a blood sample is obtained and examined for the presence of hemoglobinemia, signifying rapid intravascular hemolysis of the infused cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>However, our own experience suggests that in vivo crossmatch techniques are not practical in the hospital setting and can yield misleading results. We have encountered several instances where such testing suggested that a unit of blood was compatible, but following transfusion of the entire unit the patient suffered a hemolytic transfusion reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">ABO DISCREPANCIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even though ABO typing is a simple test with 100 percent accuracy being required, there are occasional difficulties in determining the patient's true ABO type. Such ABO discrepancies may cause positive crossmatches with some or all units of donor blood. Most issues can be resolved after careful laboratory investigation. If the patient is in need of urgent transfusion, type O blood can be safely transfused.</p><p>The following are the common causes of ABO discrepancies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A subgroups &ndash; Among all type A patients, 80 percent are type A1 and 20 percent are either type A2 or another subtype of A. Patients who are a subgroup of A can have anti-A1 antibodies that will result in positive crossmatches with A1 donor units. Type O blood should be provided to these patients. DNA-based red cell genotyping may be of value in such cases by providing optimally matched donations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-incompatible-crossmatch/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired B phenotype &ndash; When group A patients are infected with certain Gram negative bacteria, bacterial enzymes can remove an N-acetyl group from N-acetylgalactosamine on the red cell surface, resulting in galactosamine that is similar to the group B antigen's terminal galactose. ABO typing will show a weak B antigen on the patient's RBCs with strong anti-B in the plasma (normally type B patients should not have anti-B in their plasma). If the patient's plasma is crossmatched with type B donor units, the results will be incompatible. The patient's RBCs can be correctly typed by acidifying the anti-B typing reagent, which will not recognize this &quot;acquired B antigen&quot; and resolve the problem. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies#H2769413149\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;, section on 'ABO antigens'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have received ABO mismatched bone marrow or stem cell transplants will have a different ABO type than is indicated in their historical medical records. This causes confusion in ABO typing and can result in positive crossmatches. For example, type O patients who receive stem cell transplants from type A donors will have type A RBCs after engraftment, but may transiently continue to have anti-A in their plasma produced by their residual lymphocytes (normal type A patient should not have anti-A in the plasma). If the patient's plasma is crossmatched against a type A donor unit, a positive result will be obtained. In this case, type O blood should be provided.
