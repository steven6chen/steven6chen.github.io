Increased blood concentrations of cTn can also be seen in a variety of other diseases, such as sepsis, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure. In addition, stable chronic elevation of cardiac troponin may be detectable with high-sensitivity assays in patients with underlying structural (muscle) heart disease.</p><p>Potential causes of troponin elevation unrelated to coronary thrombosis will be reviewed here.

The troponin complex consists of three subunits: troponin T (cTnT), troponin I (cTnI), and troponin C. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=excitation-contraction-coupling-in-myocardium#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Excitation-contraction coupling in myocardium&quot;, section on 'Role of tropomyosin and troponins'</a>.)</p><p>The skeletal and cardiac isoforms of cTnT and cTnI are distinct, and skeletal isoforms are not detected by the monoclonal antibody-based assays currently in use, except for cTnT in some circumstances of significant skeletal muscle disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This high specificity for cardiac isoforms is the basis for the clinical utility of cTnT and cTnI assays. Contemporary troponin assays are quite sensitive and can detect very small amounts of myocardial necrosis (&lt;1 g). </p><p>The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires that cTn must be above the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile upper reference limit for the assay being used. The 99<sup>th</sup> percentile reference limit has also been shown to differ between men and women when measured with high-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The cell membrane degrades, followed by the gradual release of myofibril-bound cytosolic complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, it is possible that cardiac troponins can also be released into the circulation without myocyte necrosis.</p><p>There are other mechanisms not associated with cell death that could lead to troponin release into the circulation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased myocyte membrane permeability</strong> &ndash; It is thought that myocardial depressive factors (released in the setting of sepsis and other inflammatory states) cause degradation of free troponin to lower-molecular-weight fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. With increased membrane permeability, those smaller troponin fragments could be released into the systemic circulation. In this setting, troponin may be elevated, although myocyte cell death may not have occurred. This hypothesis is also supported by the clinical observation that myocardial depression during sepsis is a fully reversible process in most surviving patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Normal turnover of myocardial cells</strong> &ndash; Cell apoptosis leads to release of cardiac troponin degradation products, and the formation and release of membranous blebs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, direct proof of these phenomena is lacking, and these potential sources remain controversial. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2257772175\"><span class=\"h1\">DEMAND ISCHEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept of &quot;demand ischemia&quot; refers to a mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. The term was originally applied to patients with evidence of ischemia but no critical epicardial coronary heart disease (CHD). Although the same pathophysiologic principle may be valid in patients with significant CHD, it is often more difficult to identify the predominant mechanism of ischemia in such patients. The 2012 Joint European Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/World</span> Health Federation Third Universal Definition of myocardial infarction (MI) refers to a Type 2 MI when the event is secondary to ischemia due to either an increased oxygen demand or a decreased supply in the absence of an acute primary coronary thrombotic event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Myocardial oxygen supply is reduced and serum troponins are increased in a number of clinical settings: sepsis, septic shock, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]; hypotension or hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; noncardiac critically ill patients presented to the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; and atrial fibrillation or other tachyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H230973125\" class=\"local\">'Non-MI causes of an elevated troponin'</a> below.)</p><p>In these settings, decreased myocardial oxygen supply can be due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in cardiac loading conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increases in cardiac output to accommodate increased systemic oxygen consumption</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial depression</p><p/><p>Simultaneously, myocardial oxygen delivery may be reduced due to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced coronary perfusion due to both tachycardia, which reduces diastolic time, during which coronary flow occurs, and reduced perfusion pressure in the setting of hypotension and increased cardiac filling pressures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased oxygen delivery to the heart.</p><p/><p>Ultimately, these forces combine to create mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply and demand, resulting in ischemia and the release of troponin into the systemic circulation. However, this does not imply that all elevations in these individuals are due to supply-demand imbalance. In many patients, there are direct effects related to catecholamines or in sepsis to heat shock proteins and tissue necrosis factor. Thus, it should not be assumed that all elevations where one sees hemodynamic perturbations are due solely to supply-demand imbalance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H857780818\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the 2012 joint European Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/World</span> Health Federation task force document, which recommends that an elevated value of cardiac troponin, in the absence of clinical evidence of ischemia, should prompt a search for other causes of myocardial necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>]. </p><p>Some causes require immediate medical attention: myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, sepsis, or renal failure. </p><p>While an elevated troponin is generally associated with a worse prognosis, there is insufficient evidence at present to conclude that screening the general population (with troponin) is a useful practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4069428852\"><span class=\"h1\">ELEVATION IN THE GENERAL POPULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is now clear with high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays that most individuals have small amounts of measurable cTn in their blood and that even values within the normal range are of prognostic importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] (see <a href=\"#H8271833\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below). The precise mechanisms of release of these minor amounts of protein are not definitively established, but proposed causes are listed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Cellular mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p>Most conventional (sensitive, but not hs) assays detect cTn in very few normal subjects, whereas some hs assays detect cTn in nearly 100 percent depending on the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/20-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-27</a>]. Thus, detectable values with an hs assay should not automatically be considered abnormal. Such measurable values are generally stable within a range of expected biological variability. In addition, there is release of cTn after extreme exercise, after rapid atrial pacing in patients with coronary artery disease, in response to catecholamines and even small amounts during stress testing. Mechanisms other than necrosis are likely involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. With the exception of extreme exercise, these elevations are usually diminutive. &#160; &#160;</p><p>With hs assays, most individuals will have detectable values and those that are higher are at greater risk whether they have known cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as heart failure or no appreciable CVD. It is likely that these individuals release increased amounts of cTn compared with others because of comorbidities. Because cTn, and especially hs-cTn, is so sensitive, it may pick up subtle abnormalities in many individuals who are unaware of any cardiovascular comorbidities. This concept is supported by data that using more extensive screening to eliminate comorbidities that can be detected by biomarkers such as NTproBNP, HBA1C, and eGFR, and even imaging, progressively lower the upper value of a normal reference range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p>In addition, some individuals with known structural heart disease may manifest chronic (stable) elevations above the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile upper reference limit (URL) in the absence of any acute process.

Baseline hs troponin, which was within the normal range (less than the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile URL) for the vast majority of patients, was an independent predictor of coronary heart disease death, or first myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.7) over five years for the highest versus the lowest quartile of troponin. In addition, among individuals treated with statin therapy, the greatest absolute benefit was seen in those whose troponin values declined significantly compared with those whose troponin did not.

The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of elevated cTn was 12 to 85 percent, with a median of 43 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In six studies in which adjusted analyses were performed, elevated cardiac troponin was associated with a significantly increased risk of death (odds ratio 2.5; 95% CI 1.9-3.4).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tachycardia alone has been implicated as a cause of troponin elevations in small case series. In one series of 21 patients with elevated cTnI levels and normal coronary angiograms, tachycardia was determined to be the explanation of the troponin elevation in six patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A second series described four patients with troponin elevations after episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, who had no evidence of CHD. These reports illustrate that myocardial troponin can be released as a consequence of tachycardia alone in the absence of myodepressive factors, inflammatory mediators, and CHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular hypertrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>cTn elevation has been described in the context of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In a series of 74 consecutive patients without clinical evidence of active myocardial ischemia referred for routine echocardiography, 7 of 25 patients in the tertile with the greatest LV mass had an elevated cTnI. In contrast, one patient in the intermediate range, and none of the patients in the lowest tertile had an elevated troponin level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>It is well recognized that LVH can lead to occult subendocardial ischemia via increased oxygen demand from increased muscle mass, coupled with decreased flow reserve due to remodeled coronary microcirculation (see <a href=\"#H2257772175\" class=\"local\">'Demand ischemia'</a> above). Similar observations have been made in the setting of aortic valve disease, in which elevated troponin level was associated with greater LV wall thickness and higher pulmonary artery systolic pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary vasospasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocardial ischemia caused by coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal angina) can lead to troponin elevations.

In these reports, cTnI elevations correlated with both the severity of neurologic injury and cardiovascular abnormalities including LV dysfunction, pulmonary edema, and hypotension requiring pressors. In one of the studies, elevations in cTnI also predicted a higher likelihood of in-hospital death or severe disability at discharge, although this relationship was no longer significant at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Thus, it is not clear to what extent the LV dysfunction and hemodynamic compromise reported in these case series is due to acute myocardial injury in the setting of the stroke, or reflects new myocardial and hemodynamic stress in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease.</p><p>In addition, since follow-up echocardiograms were not routinely obtained, it is not known how many of these patients may have had improvement in LV function after recovering from the acute stroke. Reversible LV dysfunction in the setting of acute noncardiac illness is an increasingly reported phenomenon, and autonomic imbalance with catecholamine excess is proposed to play a role in both stroke-related myocardial injury and stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

Comparing patients with abnormal troponin T concentrations at baseline with those with normal concentrations, the five-year rate of the composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke was significantly increased (27.1 versus 12.9 percent; adjusted hazard ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.48-2.32). This adverse prognosis was not altered by those who received an invasive strategy as part of the BARI trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

While troponin is highly specific for myocardial cell release, it is not specific for acute coronary syndrome as the cause. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased blood concentrations of cTn can also be seen in a variety of non-thrombotic diseases, such as sepsis, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure. In addition, stable chronic elevation of cardiac troponin may be detectable with high-sensitivity assays in patients with underlying structural (myocardial) heart disease, including those with stable coronary artery disease. (See <a href=\"#H230973125\" class=\"local\">'Non-MI causes of an elevated troponin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated troponin is associated with a worse prognosis across the spectrum, from healthy individuals to those with life-threatening disease. (See <a href=\"#H8271833\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We search for the cause of the elevated value of cTn in patients who are not diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction. (See <a href=\"#H857780818\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While an elevated troponin is associated with a worse prognosis in both secondary and primary prevention studies, the difference of the values between those at risk and those who are not is small and may not allow for clinical distinctions to be made. In addition, what should be done in response to the increased risk remains to be defined. Accordingly, there is insufficient evidence at present to conclude that screening the general population (with troponin) is a useful practice. (See <a href=\"#H857780818\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8271833\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jaffe AS, Vasile VC, Milone M, et al.
