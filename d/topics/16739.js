Increases in syphilis among women is often followed by increases in congenital syphilis cases as most cases are in reproductive-aged women.</p><p>After a steady decline, the rate of congenital syphilis has also increased 86.9 percent between 2012 and 2016, with 15.7 cases per 100,000 live births reported in 2016. Congenital syphilis rates (cases per 100,000 live births) among infants by maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> were: black (43.1), American <span class=\"nowrap\">Indian/Alaska</span> Native (31.6), Hispanic (20.5), <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islander (9.2), and white (5.3).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1239743989\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Syphilis occurs with equal frequency in men and women worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but men are more commonly infected in the United States. It is more common among pregnant women who are poor, young (age &lt;29 years), African American, and lack health insurance and prenatal care. Other risk factors include use of illicit drugs, infection with other sexually transmitted diseases, residence in an area of high syphilis prevalence, and being a sex worker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MATERNAL ACQUISITION OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually all new maternal syphilis infections are sexually acquired. Sexual transmission requires exposure to open lesions in which organisms are present. The spirochetes pass from the lesion across intact mucous membranes or abraded skin into the new host. The efficiency of sexual (horizontal) transmission is estimated to be approximately 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The incubation period varies from 10 to 90 days (average approximately three weeks); larger inocula shorten this incubation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The cost and morbidity associated with screening for syphilis are low and the benefit of detecting and treating the disease is high for both mother and child. Universal screening for syphilis has the advantage of removing the stigma of testing since all pregnant women are screened, not just those considered to be at higher risk. The major harm of screening is the anxiety associated with a false-positive result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Routinely rescreening all women in the third trimester <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delivery is not cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For women who are at high risk for acquiring syphilis (eg, diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease during pregnancy; exchanging sex for drugs or money; having unprotected sex with more than one partner [or monogamous sex with a partner who is not monogamous], especially with residence in an area of high syphilis prevalence), the CDC recommends repeating screening during the third trimester at 28 to 32 weeks and again at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3479864598\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening outside of traditional prenatal care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for syphilis should be considered when a pregnancy is diagnosed in a nonobstetric setting, such as a drug treatment center, prison, emergency medicine department, or outreach program, given that many women infected with syphilis do not receive prenatal care until they present for delivery.</p><p>Rapid point of care tests are less accurate than standard nontreponemal and treponemal tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but can be helpful in guiding initial treatment decisions in women who are unlikely to return for follow-up.

HIV testing is strongly recommended for those known to have a sexually transmitted disease, such as syphilis, due to the high risk of coexistent disease. Universal screening removes stigma and facilitates more widespread acceptance of HIV testing. HIV test is repeated whenever syphilis screening is repeated.

Methods that detect the organism directly (eg, darkfield microscopy) are not generally available.</p><p>Serologic testing to diagnose syphilis should include the use of both nontreponemal and treponemal tests. Either test can be used as the initial screening test, depending on the preference of the laboratory doing the test. A diagnosis of syphilis is made when both nontreponemal and treponemal tests are reactive. Confirmatory testing is necessary due to the potential for a false-positive screening test result.</p><p>Nontreponemal tests include: Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and Toluidine Red Unheated Serum Test (TRUST). Specific treponemal tests include: Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS), Microhemagglutination test for antibodies to <em>Treponema pallidum</em> (MHA-TP), <em>T. pallidum</em> particle agglutination assay (TPPA), <em>T. pallidum</em> enzyme immunoassay (TP-EIA), and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA).</p><p>The diagnostic interpretation of syphilis serology is the same as in nonpregnant individuals.

False-positive nontreponemal test results can also be related to an acute event, such as an acute febrile illness or recent immunization. Test abnormalities attributed to these conditions are usually transitory and typically last for six months or less. Follow-up testing is not required during pregnancy, but some clinicians may choose to repeat the nontreponemal and treponemal tests at 28 to 32 weeks in this setting.</p><p>All women with biologic false positives attributed to pregnancy or another transient event should undergo follow-up testing four to six weeks after delivery. If the nontreponemal test continues to be positive with a negative treponemal test, then additional work-up to determine the etiology of the positive test is needed.

A synopsis is provided below and in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79946 \">table 1</a>). A detailed discussion of staging, including photographs of lesions, can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H3638352602\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Stages of disease'</a>.)</p><p>The stage of syphilis is clinically important because it impacts the treatment regimen and the risk of vertical transmission. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Vertical transmission'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2541003098\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary syphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first manifestation of syphilis is a papule, which is typically painless, at the site of inoculation. This soon ulcerates to produce the classic chancre(s) of primary syphilis, a 1 to 2 centimeter painless ulcer with a raised, indurated margin that may be genital or extragenital. The ulcer is associated with mild to moderate regional lymphadenopathy that is often bilateral. Chancres heal spontaneously within three to six weeks, even in the absence of treatment. The primary stage of syphilis is often missed in women because the lesion is on vaginal or cervical mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3706887244\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary syphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary syphilis is a disseminated systemic process that begins six weeks to six months after the appearance of the chancre in approximately 25 percent of untreated patients. A generalized maculopapular skin rash involving the palms and soles and mucous membranes, but usually sparing the face, is characteristic of this stage of the infection. Generalized lymphadenopathy accompanies the skin rash. Additional clinical features include fever, pharyngitis, weight loss, and large genital lesions called condylomata lata. Although spirochetes can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of around 40 to 50 percent of patients with early syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], neurologic manifestations are rare. The rash of secondary syphilis typically resolves spontaneously within two to six weeks. Secondary syphilis is commonly the stage when women present to a health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1293785137\"><span class=\"h2\">Latent syphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Latent syphilis is by definition asymptomatic. If untreated, a proportion of patients will develop signs and symptoms of secondary or late syphilis, but many will remain asymptomatic. Women with latent syphilis may transmit the infection to the fetus. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Vertical transmission'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients with latent syphilis may actually have early syphilis, but the signs and symptoms are not noticed by the patient because they are subtle or located in places on the body not frequently examined. For this reason, when a serologic test for syphilis is reactive, the clinician should do a thorough examination to look for signs of early syphilis.</p><p>Patients with &quot;latent&quot; syphilis who do not recognize the signs and symptoms of primary or mild secondary syphilis can transmit the infection to sexual partners, or the fetus.</p><p>In the United States, latent syphilis is defined as &quot;early latent&quot; when it is possible to document a nonreactive syphilis serology within the past year or a history of symptoms of early syphilis within the past year. Otherwise, the disease is considered &quot;late latent&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1634202336\"><span class=\"h2\">Tertiary (late) syphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tertiary syphilis occurs in approximately one-third of untreated patients, but is now rarely seen since most patients are treated either deliberately or inadvertently when receiving penicillin for other indications. Tertiary syphilis is characterized by slowly progressive signs and symptoms. Clinical manifestations include gumma formation and cardiovascular disease. Such manifestations usually develop 5 to 20 years after the disease has become latent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4088164617\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurosyphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early in the course of syphilis, the most common forms of neurosyphilis involve the cerebrospinal fluid, meninges, and vasculature (asymptomatic meningitis, symptomatic meningitis, and meningovascular disease). A sometimes underappreciated manifestation of early neurosyphilis is eye involvement (eg, uveitis), which may be more common among persons who are infected with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Late in disease, the most common forms involve the brain and spinal cord parenchyma (general paresis and tabes dorsalis).

(See <a href=\"#H2268642049\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization'</a> below.)</p><p>The authors administer treatment for syphilis in an outpatient setting, and counsel patients about potential side effects and when to contact their provider. Others may choose to administer the first dose&nbsp;of penicillin in a labor and delivery unit with continuous fetal monitoring for at least 24 hours in viable pregnancies in case of Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction and its potential sequelae (eg, preterm labor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

No clinically relevant penicillin-resistant strains of <em>T. pallidum </em>have been identified to date. Penicillin therapy in pregnancy is effective for treating maternal disease, preventing transmission to the fetus, and treating established fetal disease. Because penicillin is considered the only appropriate treatment of syphilis during pregnancy, pregnant women with penicillin allergy should be desensitized and treated with penicillin. (See <a href=\"#H2214075712\" class=\"local\">'Patients with immediate type allergic reactions to penicillin'</a> below.).</p><p>The appropriate penicillin regimen depends on the stage of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79645 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1984504721\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary, secondary, or early latent disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> 2.4 million units intramuscularly is only appropriate for women with primary, secondary, or early latent disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79645 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2541003098\" class=\"local\">'Primary syphilis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3706887244\" class=\"local\">'Secondary syphilis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1293785137\" class=\"local\">'Latent syphilis'</a> above). Some clinicians administer an additional dose of penicillin G benzathine 2.4 million units one week after the first dose to these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], based in part of evidence of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>] and on pharmacokinetic data of penicillin levels in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. There is no harm to giving a second dose, but it has not been recommended in guidelines from national organizations because the value of a second dose has not been evaluated in a randomized trial and there have been shortages of penicillin G benzathine in some countries. A second dose of penicillin is not administered to nonpregnant patients with primary, secondary, or early latent disease.

As discussed above, alternative regimens are either not as safe for the mother or fetus or not as effective for prevention of congenital infection; therefore, they should only be used in very exceptional circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H262042555\" class=\"local\">'Use of non-penicillin regimens'</a> below.)</p><p>Penicillin allergy is reported by 5 to 10 percent of pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; however, serious allergic reactions to penicillin are rare. It is important to verify the history of &quot;allergy,&quot; since the patient may incorrectly assume a nonallergic side effect (eg, nausea or vomiting) to be allergic in origin. The major symptoms of concern are immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated (immediate) responses, such as urticaria, angioedema or anaphylaxis with airway obstruction, bronchospasm or hypotension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71375 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3259546530\"><span class=\"h3\">Referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who report symptoms suggestive of a past immediate allergy to a penicillin should be evaluated with penicillin skin testing, if possible.

In addition, allergists can perform rapid drug desensitization protocols if appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H2268642049\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization'</a> below.)</p><p>Many patients will give a vague history of a mild reaction, such as rash, which is difficult to classify with any precision.

Failure to detect or adequately treat maternal disease often results in serious sequelae for the fetus and neonate. Penicillin remains the gold standard for the treatment of syphilis in both pregnant and nonpregnant patients. Penicillin desensitization is indicated for infected pregnant women with documented penicillin allergy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each stage of syphilis has characteristic clinical features that are not altered by pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79946 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1968244829\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic evaluation for syphilis is the same in pregnant and nonpregnant women. A diagnosis of syphilis is made when both nontreponemal and treponemal tests are reactive. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend screening pregnant women for syphilis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest the following schedule (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Maternal screening'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All pregnant women: screen at the first prenatal encounter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women at high risk of infection: repeat screening at 28 to 32 weeks and at delivery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women who have not been screened in pregnancy or who deliver a stillborn after 20 weeks of gestation: screen at delivery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive (reactive) low titer nontreponemal screening test can be considered a transient biologic false positive result due to pregnancy if the follow-up treponemal test is negative and the patient is asymptomatic and at low risk of acute syphilis. (See <a href=\"#H604692657\" class=\"local\">'Biologic false positive nontreponemal test due to pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penicillin therapy is effective for treating maternal disease, preventing transmission to the fetus, and treating established fetal disease. (See <a href=\"#H909586315\" class=\"local\">'Maternal treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appropriate penicillin regimen depends on the stage of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79645 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary, secondary, or early latent disease: a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> 2.4 million units intramuscularly. Some clinicians administer an additional dose of penicillin G benzathine 2.4 million units one week after the first dose. (See <a href=\"#H1984504721\" class=\"local\">'Primary, secondary, or early latent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Late latent, tertiary, and disease of unknown duration: three doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> 2.4 million unit intramuscularly at weekly intervals. If a dose is missed for more than 14 days, the full three dose course of therapy should be started again. (See <a href=\"#H2251843760\" class=\"local\">'Late latent, tertiary, and disease of unknown duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If an asymptomatic patient with what could be latent syphilis was previously treated for syphilis but receipt of an appropriate treatment regimen cannot be verified, the full three-dose penicillin regimen recommended for late latent syphilis should be administered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend desensitization for penicillin-allergic pregnant patients followed by penicillin therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Alternative drugs are not as safe for the pregnant woman or fetus or not as effective for prevention of congenital syphilis. (See <a href=\"#H2214075712\" class=\"local\">'Patients with immediate type allergic reactions to penicillin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H262042555\" class=\"local\">'Use of non-penicillin regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of syphilis may precipitate the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which may precipitate uterine contractions, preterm labor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing in pregnant women treated in the second half of pregnancy. We provide supportive care of maternal discomfort and standard obstetrical management of pregnancy complications. (See <a href=\"#H2644832185\" class=\"local\">'Potential complications of treatment: Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women treated for early syphilis should have a titer checked just before treatment, since it is not uncommon for this titer to be higher than that of the initial diagnostic titer due to elapsed time between diagnosis and therapy. Serologic titers are checked monthly in pregnant women at high risk for reinfection or in geographic areas in which the prevalence of syphilis is high. For pregnant women at low risk of reinfection, serologic titers can be checked between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation and at delivery. When monitoring non-treponemal titers, the same test, preferably the rapid plasmin regain (RPR), should be performed each time and at the same laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H3898138373\" class=\"local\">'Frequency and interpretation of nontreponemal titers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fourfold increase in the nontreponemal titer after treatment is always abnormal. A fourfold decline in the titer, equivalent to a change of two dilutions (eg, from 1:16 to 1:4 or from 1:32 to 1:8), is considered to be an acceptable response to syphilis therapy; however, this can take months to achieve. A fall in maternal titers does not guarantee that fetal treatment has been adequate. (See <a href=\"#H624046807\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of treatment failure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2738116912\" class=\"local\">'Antepartum fetal monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of vertical transmission is higher with early stage than late stage syphilis. Among women who acquire syphilis during pregnancy, the risk of vertical transmission increases with increasing gestational age at acquisition of maternal infection. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Vertical transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal infection should be suspected if there are characteristic findings on ultrasound examination after 20 weeks of gestation in a woman with untreated or inadequately treated syphilis. Hepatomegaly and placentomegaly are early sonographic findings suggestive of congenital syphilis. Anemia, ascites, and hydrops occur later in the course of fetal infection. An abnormal ultrasound is not diagnostic of fetal infection and a normal ultrasound does not exclude fetal infection. (See <a href=\"#H1537935544\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal penicillin treatment is curative for fetal infection in most cases. Maternal treatment &le;30 days before delivery is a risk factor for congenital infection. (See <a href=\"#H3464215100\" class=\"local\">'Fetal treatment and treatment failure'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
