(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to other skin cancers (eg, squamous and basal cell carcinomas), melanomas are aggressive neoplasms that may spread in an unpredictable manner to involve virtually any organ of the body. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to minimizing morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of basal cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma-scc\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic and prognostic information provided by pathologic review of the surgical specimen influences the selection of treatment for patients with melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, accurate pathologic diagnosis can be challenging, even to the most experienced pathologist, due to variability in cytomorphology and architecture, and the similarity of some melanomas to benign nevomelanocytic lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GROWTH PHASES OF MELANOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During embryogenesis, the neural crest-derived melanocytes migrate into the epidermis and hair follicles to reside in the basal layer of the epidermis. These melanocytes, which are spaced at approximately every tenth cell along the basal layer, possess dendritic processes that transfer melanosomes to neighboring keratinocytes and hair matrices.</p><p>Nevi (both congenital and acquired) are composed of nevus cells, which are melanocytes that have lost their dendritic processes and typically proliferate clonally to form nests of cells. The more common acquired nevus begins as a flat lesion (junctional nevus) and over time progresses to an elevated lesion (compound nevus). Historically, the concept of abtropfung, or &quot;dropping off&quot; of nevus cells into the dermis, has been used to explain progression from a junctional to a compound nevus. However, this concept has been challenged. The alternative melanocyte differentiation pathway postulates that the upward migration of melanocytes into the epidermis forms the basis of nevus formation.</p><p>Most malignant melanomas arise as superficial indolent tumors that are confined to the epidermis, where they remain for several years. During this stage, known as the horizontal or &quot;radial&quot; growth phase, the melanoma is almost always curable by surgical excision alone. At some point, probably in response to the stepwise accumulation of genetic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], the melanoma is transformed into an expansile nodule that extends beyond the biologic boundary of the basement membrane and invades the dermis. Although the molecular changes that accompany melanocytic tumor progression are not yet elucidated, the technique of comparative genomic hybridization has yielded important insights into the progression of these neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Gene amplifications at specific loci, especially those encoding proteins involved in cell-cycle progression, have been associated with the acquisition of metastatic potential early in the progression of some melanomas, such as acral melanomas. By contrast, these gene amplifications are found less frequently in other histologic subtypes of melanomas, and if present, they arise in later stages of tumor progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Some superficially invasive malignant melanomas (termed &quot;microinvasive radial growth phase&quot; melanomas) remain highly curable with surgery alone, but those that infiltrate deep into the dermis are considered to be in a &quot;vertical&quot; growth phase, and have metastatic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Biologically, vertical growth phase melanomas have different cell surface antigen expression, cytogenetic profiles, and growth characteristics that enhance their metastatic propensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Radial growth phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radial growth phase melanomas are thin, primarily confined to the epidermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51802\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51802 \">picture 1</a>), and behave in an indolent fashion. These melanomas are represented by two histopathologic patterns &ndash; in situ melanomas and microinvasive melanomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">In situ melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant melanoma in situ (MMIS) is a form of radial growth phase melanoma in which the proliferation of malignant melanocytes is restricted to the epidermis. Of the four major subtypes of melanoma, an in situ form exists for superficial spreading, acral lentiginous, and lentigo maligna melanomas, but not nodular melanomas. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Major subtypes of invasive melanoma'</a> below.)</p><p>In the superficial spreading variant of MMIS, the malignant melanocytes extend away from their normal position along the basal layer throughout the epidermis, and even into the stratum corneum, a phenomenon termed &quot;pagetoid spread&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61083\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61083 \">picture 2</a>). Acral lentiginous MMIS is characterized by uniformly atypical dendritic melanocytes that are aligned in a contiguous array along the dermal-epidermal junction.</p><p>There is confusion in the literature and a lack of consensus regarding the definition of MMIS of the lentigo maligna type. We define MMIS-lentigo maligna type as an in situ melanoma that is characterized by continuous lentiginous proliferation of atypical cells with pagetoid spread that involves the full thickness of the epidermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53790 \">picture 3</a>). In contrast, the term lentigo maligna refers to a premalignant lesion that is characterized by less continuous lentiginous proliferation, lower cellularity, and less than full thickness pagetoid spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Once the tumor becomes invasive, the lesion is considered lentigo maligna melanoma. Thus, lentigo maligna, MMIS-lentigo maligna type, and lentigo maligna melanoma should be considered as stages along a spectrum of malignant progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Microinvasive radial growth phase melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to epidermal involvement, microinvasive melanomas are characterized by microscopic papillary dermal extension, and they tend to behave in an indolent fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71855\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71855 \">picture 4</a>). By definition, the largest dermal &quot;nest&quot; can be no larger than the largest epidermal nest, and dermal mitoses are not allowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast to more invasive melanomas that involve the dermis, the morphology of the dermal nevomelanocytes is similar to that of the epidermal component. Frequently, a predominantly lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate is present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vertical growth phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most vertical growth phase melanomas are clearly invasive, extending deeply into the dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54748%7EONC%2F75460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54748 graphicRef75460 \">picture 5A-B</a>). Included in the term &quot;vertical growth phase melanoma&quot; are lesions that are associated with an expansile nodule filling the papillary dermis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasion of reticular dermis or fat. These features correspond to the histologic level of invasion (Clark level) III, IV, and V [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some Clark level II lesions can qualify as vertical growth phase lesions if a dermal nest is larger than the largest epidermal nest, or there is a mitosis in the dermis.</p><p>Once a melanoma enters a vertical growth phase, it possesses the potential for metastasis. By definition, a vertical growth phase melanoma has at least one dermal mitosis or one dermal nest larger than the largest epidermal nest. These features represent the earliest histologic evidence of progression from a nonmetastatic to a potentially metastatic lesion.</p><p>Vertical growth phase melanomas can arise de novo or from a radial growth phase melanoma. It may take decades for some melanomas to reach vertical growth phase, while others develop an early vertical growth phase. Nodular melanomas have no identifiable radial growth phase, and enter the vertical growth phase almost from their inception. The probability of metastases with invasive, vertical growth phase melanoma may be predicted by measuring in millimeters the depth of invasion of the vertical growth phase nodule below the granular cell layer of the overlying epidermis, as described originally by Breslow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;, section on 'Eighth edition AJCC TNM staging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR SUBTYPES OF INVASIVE MELANOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melanomas are characterized by significant morphologic diversity, and four distinct histologic patterns are described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In descending order of frequency, these are superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, and acral lentiginous melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although histologic subtype does not directly correlate with clinical behavior, subclassification is important for histopathologic recognition and diagnosis. The table presents a comparison of histologic features among the four major subtypes of malignant melanoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57168 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial spreading melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common subtype, comprising approximately 75 percent of all malignant melanomas. Approximately 30 percent of superficial spreading melanomas are found in association with a preexisting nevus, such as a dysplastic or congenital nevus, while the majority appear to arise de novo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These melanomas derive their name from histologic evidence of lateral (radial) growth for a period of time before vertical (invasive) growth occurs. Although superficial spreading melanoma has a predilection for the back in men and lower extremities in women, it can occur in any anatomic location, and at any age.</p><p>Clinically, the superficial spreading type of melanoma appears as a variably pigmented plaque with an irregular border, ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57466\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57466 \">picture 6</a>). In fully evolved lesions, multiple shades of red, tan, brown, blue, black, gray, and white can be appreciated. The red zones are thought to represent areas of vessel ectasia and inflammation, and the white and gray regions reflect amelanotic or regressed foci. An asymmetric flare at the lesion periphery represents the advancing border of proliferating, neoplastic melanocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Melanoma: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Histologically, superficial spreading melanomas are asymmetric, poorly circumscribed, and lack cellular maturation (ie, the nests and cells do not become smaller as they descend into the reticular dermis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62540 \">picture 7</a>). Typically, the intraepidermal component extends laterally for more than three rete ridges past the confines of the dermal component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In the radial phase of growth, there is haphazard growth of neoplastic melanocytes with single-cell spread throughout the layers of the epidermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62540 \">picture 7</a>). This pagetoid spread of neoplastic melanocytes confers an appearance that resembles buckshot scatter. Cytologically, the melanocytes are often epithelioid in morphology, with large round-to-oval nuclei, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, and ample eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm that is filled with fine melanin granules. Where neoplastic melanocytes form nests, the nests are often poorly formed and not cohesive.</p><p>A lymphocytic infiltrate is sometimes observed in the underlying papillary dermis; the presence of such an infiltrate in the earliest stages may signal incipient transformation to a microinvasive tumor. In the microinvasive radial growth phase of superficial spreading melanoma, both single-cell dispersal and nests of neoplastic melanocytes can be seen in the papillary dermis. The cytomorphology of these cells is similar to that seen with entirely intraepidermal growth, although the cytoplasm is characteristically more abundant and eosinophilic in the microinvasive radial growth phase. The largest nest in the dermis should not exceed the largest epidermal nest in size, and dermal mitoses should be absent.</p><p>Transition to vertical growth phase occurs when the largest nest in the dermis exceeds that in the epidermis, or if mitoses become evident within the dermis. Superficial spreading melanomas in vertical growth phase may be confused with nodular malignant melanoma. The presence of an epidermal component extending three rete ridges beyond the dermal component distinguishes vertical growth phase superficial spreading melanoma from nodular malignant melanoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Lentigo maligna melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lentigo maligna melanoma most commonly arises in sun-damaged areas of the skin in older individuals, and begins as a freckle-like tan-brown macule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The lesion gradually enlarges and develops darker, asymmetric foci (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62105 \">picture 8</a>). When the lesion is confined to the epidermis (MMIS-lentigo maligna type), it presents as a nonpalpable macule. Approximately 5 percent of intraepidermal lesions evolve to become clinically palpable, signaling dermal invasion and transformation into lentigo maligna melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Transformation is slow, and the lesion may be present for 10 to 50 years before a vertical growth phase becomes apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Partial regression is not uncommon during evolution, a phenomenon that is represented by foci of blue-gray or light gray coloration. Once a lentigo maligna melanoma is fully evolved, color variegation can be striking.</p><p>Histologically, neoplastic melanocytes are arrayed along the dermal-epidermal junction in a lentiginous pattern against a background of epidermal atrophy and solar elastosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73737\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73737 \">picture 9</a>). During the radial growth phase, the atypical melanocytes are usually polygonal in shape with hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei, and they are dispersed along the dermal-epidermal junction as well as along eccrine ducts and the outer root sheath epithelium of hair follicles. Multinucleated giant melanocytes (&quot;star-burst giant cells&quot;) may be present at the basal layer of the epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These multinucleated giant cells can contain up to 30 nuclei, and their atypical morphology is similar to those in the lentiginous array.</p><p>As the lesion progresses, poorly cohesive or dyshesive nests are seen along the dermal-epidermal junction, and they are aligned parallel to the long axis of the epidermis, forming the &quot;swallow's nest&quot; sign. Pagetoid spread, the confluence of melanocytes along the basal layer, and nesting all herald an incipient invasive phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The hallmark of the vertical growth phase is the formation of dermal nodules and fascicles that are larger than the epidermal component. The melanocytes are often pleomorphic with variably hyperchromatic nuclei. The cytoplasm of the tumor cells is shrunken and surrounds a pale nucleus with small nucleoli. Numerous mitoses and exuberant pagetoid spread are frequently observed. The lentiginous proliferation extends down the external root sheath of hair follicles, a feature that accounts for the high recurrence rates when these lesions are superficially ablated. Other accompanying features include a lymphocytic infiltrate and the presence of melanophages. The invasive dermal component of lentigo maligna melanoma may assume a spindle cell appearance with background desmoplastic stroma. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Desmoplastic melanoma'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acral lentiginous melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acral lentiginous melanomas are the least common variant of radial growth phase melanomas, comprising fewer than 5 percent of all melanomas. They arise most commonly on palmar, plantar, subungual, and occasionally, mucosal surfaces. The acral lentiginous subtype is the most common type of malignant melanoma among Asians and dark-skinned individuals, with a particular predilection for the soles of the feet. </p><p>Subungual melanoma arises from the nail matrix and usually presents as a longitudinal brown or black band, with or without nail dystrophy. The involvement of the proximal nail fold (Hutchinson&rsquo;s sign) is considered a clue to the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Sometimes the presentation is that of a subungual mass (with or without pigmentation) with various degrees of ulceration and nail plate destruction (onychodystrophy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Not all melanomas arising in acral sites are acral lentiginous melanomas. Four histologic patterns may be seen in melanomas arising on the acral surfaces: acral lentiginous melanoma, nodular melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, and an unclassified type. In a histologic study of 62 cases of plantar melanoma from Japan, 14 percent were classified as nodular melanoma and 3 percent as superficial spreading melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Clinically, an acral lentiginous melanoma appears as a dark brown to black, unevenly pigmented patch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78826\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78826 \">picture 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Areas of regression manifest as foci of gray-white discoloration. If a lesion becomes raised or develops ulceration, the likelihood of invasion should be considered. However, some tumors that invade along the peri-eccrine adventitial dermis may appear flat clinically even if they have encroached upon subcutaneous adipose tissue.</p><p>Histologically, early acral lentiginous melanomas are characterized by a lentiginous array of atypical melanocytes along the dermal-epidermal junction, with foci of confluent melanocytic growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82287\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82287 \">picture 11</a>). With progression, large junctional nests that are composed of atypical melanocytes form, and atypical single cells extend into the epidermis (pagetoid spread) independently of the junctional nests. Confluence of junctional nests frequently heralds microinvasion of single cells into the papillary dermis during the radial growth phase. Invasive lesions are characterized by the presence of neoplastic single cells or nests in the dermis.</p><p>Cytologically, the lentiginous array of atypical cells is composed of large, hyperchromatic, angulated melanocytes with scant cytoplasm. Prominent dendritic processes highlighted by fine melanin granules extend into the stratum spinosum. Single cells that spread upward into the epidermis in a pagetoid fashion appear epithelioid, like those seen in superficial spreading melanomas. The junctional nests are large with marked loss of cohesiveness, and they contain cells of epithelioid or spindle shape, and severe nuclear atypia.</p><p>In invasive lesions, the morphology of neoplastic single cells or nests is similar to that of the epidermal component, except their cytoplasm is more abundant with fine pigmentation. Two useful histologic features can help with the distinction of acral lentiginous melanomas from benign acral nevi:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predominance of a single-cell over a nested pattern; the converse is observed for benign acral nevi</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a lichenoid inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes admixed with melanophages, a feature that is virtually absent in benign acral nevi</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Nodular melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, nodular melanomas are vertical growth phase melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. They constitute 15 to 30 percent of all melanomas. Clinically, a nodular melanoma appears as a darkly pigmented, pedunculated or polypoid nodule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80955\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80955 \">picture 12</a>), although amelanotic variants are infrequently seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Histologically, dermal growth occurs in isolation or, occasionally, in association with an epidermal component (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57679\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57679 \">picture 13</a>). When an epidermal component is present, it must not extend beyond three rete ridges of the dermal component. The neoplastic cells within the dermal growth may appear epithelioid or spindled. Mitoses are frequent and often atypical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">RARE VARIANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The challenge of correctly diagnosing certain types of melanoma is due, in part, to their mimicry of benign lesions. As many as seventeen rare variants of malignant melanoma have been described in the last few decades, and new variants continue to emerge. In this section, we will emphasize nevoid melanoma and desmoplastic melanoma, variants that can escape the attention of even the most skilled pathologist because of their resemblance to nonpathologic conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Nevoid melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nevoid melanomas are frequently mistaken for benign dermal nevi because of their superficial resemblance to this lesion, both clinically and histologically. However, nevoid melanoma behaves as a variant of malignant melanoma with metastatic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Clinically, these lesions appear as verrucous or dome-shaped nodules frequently present on the trunk or proximal limbs of young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Histologically, nevoid melanoma resembles a dermal nevus in that it lacks a prominent intraepidermal component and has a rather bland dermal component (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67103\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67103 \">picture 14A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, careful inspection reveals that the dermal component has properties of frank vertical growth phase melanoma. On medium power view, it can be seen that the dermal component has striking hypercellularity and hyperchromasia, and the neoplastic nevoid cells lack true maturation, but instead display a phenomenon termed &quot;pseudomaturation&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77882\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77882 \">picture 14B</a>). With higher power magnification, the nevoid cells appear to become smaller in the deeper dermis (as is observed with true maturation of melanocytes in benign nevi), but the cells are very hyperchromatic and are malignant appearing, with readily observed mitoses. Immunohistochemical studies using proliferation antigens and HMB-45 can aid in diagnosis of nevoid melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Fluorescent in situ hybridization may also be useful for distinguishing between this variant of melanoma and benign nevi. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Fluorescence in situ hybridization'</a> below.)</p><p>Two variants of nevoid melanoma are recognized; one is composed of large, epithelioid cells resembling the cells of a Spitz nevus (a red-pink, isolated, dome-shaped papule or nodule that usually occurs in young children and is composed of large plump cells with pink-blue cytoplasm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Spitzoid melanoma should be distinguished from melanocytic tumors associated with BAP-1 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), or &quot;melanoma of soft parts&quot;, was initially described in 1965 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. For many years, due to the occasional presence of melanin pigment and melanosomes, CCS was thought to be histogenetically related to melanoma. However, CCS bears only a phenotypic resemblance to malignant melanoma. Subsequent genetic studies have demonstrated a characteristic translocation [t(12;22)(q13;q13)], which results in a unique fusion gene that is not found in cutaneous or uveal malignant melanomas, but instead related to those found in some sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Although a potentially aggressive tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], its clinical course is usually more indolent than most malignant melanomas.</p><p>Grossly, CCS often appears fleshy and white, bearing more resemblance to a soft tissue sarcoma than a melanoma. Histologic examination reveals large, polygonal cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. The cells frequently have an eccentrically located nucleus, conferring a &quot;plasmacytoid&quot; appearance; binucleation is also observed.</p><p>Although the presence of melanin can be demonstrated by special stains in most cases of CCS, melanin is rarely seen on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Confirmation of the presence of melanin is helpful in distinguishing CCS from other soft tissue sarcomas, especially fibrosarcoma and synovial sarcoma.
