The degree of myelosuppression and the time to hematopoietic recovery differ with multiple factors including the preparative regimen and graft source. Blood product transfusions and hematopoietic growth factors are essential components of transplant care. </p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous PBPC transplantation).</p><p>Hematopoietic support after HCT will be discussed here. Other supportive care issues surrounding HCT are presented separately, as is quality of life following HCT and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the hematopoietic cell transplant recipient in the immediate post-transplant period&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quality of life following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary, renal, and infectious complications following HCT are also presented separately.

In addition, blood product support, with resulting iron overload, is commonly seen in those patients undergoing HCT for a hematologic disorder. Such iron overload (eg, serum ferritin &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> may adversely affect overall survival post-HCT, increasing the likelihood of acute graft-versus-host disease, as well as the incidence of blood stream infections and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Virtually all patients undergoing transplantation require blood product support in the form of red blood cell and platelet transfusions until the transplanted marrow cells engraft sufficiently to support hematopoiesis. This generally requires 14 to 21 days or more with bone marrow but is accelerated with peripheral blood progenitor cells with engraftment typically requiring 10 to 14 days.</p><p>All cytomegalovirus (CMV)-negative patients who receive bone marrow cells from a CMV-negative donor should receive seronegative blood products. In addition, it is highly recommended to use irradiated blood products with or without leukodepletion methods to avoid the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease and other transfusion-related complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transfusional needs may be significantly reduced in patients undergoing nonmyeloablative preparative regimens. As an example, in a comparative retrospective analysis, platelet transfusions were required in 23 versus 100 percent, and red cell transfusions in 63 versus 96 percent of those undergoing nonmyeloablative or myeloablative transplants, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876308\"><span class=\"h2\">Red blood cell transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for transfusion of blood products vary from center to center. With respect to transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), many centers use a threshold of 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> of hemoglobin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters#H904532\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, specialized modifications, and infusion parameters&quot;, section on 'Packed RBCs versus whole blood'</a>.)</p><p>This threshold may be influenced by a number of factors including the number of days from the transplant, the clinical condition of the patient, and evidence of engraftment of other cell types including reticulocytes. Patients with graft-versus-host disease or those being treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> may have continued blood product requirements from bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microangiopathic hemolysis.</p><p>Typically, type O blood is utilized if there is a major ABO mismatch between donor and recipient until engraftment of donor RBCs is confirmed. Cases of delayed hemolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pure red cell aplasia have been described in patients with pre-existing alloantibodies against Rh or ABO antigens, despite the presence of 100 percent donor chimerism of the circulating lymphocytes. This is discussed in more detail separately.

In comparison, the role of prophylactic platelet transfusions remains controversial. We generally transfuse for platelet counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> or for higher values if clinical bleeding is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115892 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H323107\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic versus prophylactic transfusion'</a>.)</p><p>Many transplant centers have relied upon threshold values of platelet numbers to determine the timing of platelet transfusions. This has been questioned because of the risk of accelerating alloimmunization against future platelet transfusions, the relatively short half-life of transfused platelets, and expense. Several multicenter studies of platelet recovery have addressed this issue in the setting of HCT: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial, 400 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; patients with APL were excluded) and patients undergoing autologous HCT for hematologic malignancies were assigned to receive platelet transfusions when morning platelet counts were <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span> or only for active bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients transfused only for active bleeding received fewer platelet transfusions during the 14-day period after induction or consolidation chemotherapy (1.63 versus 2.44 per patient). Patients undergoing HCT experienced more bleeding episodes when transfused only for active bleeding, but most of these were minor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another randomized trial, 600 patients with hematologic malignancies receiving chemotherapy, autologous, or allogeneic HCT were assigned to receive platelet transfusion for a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span> or only for active bleeding (the Trial of Prophylactic Platelets [TOPPS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Compared with those who received prophylactic transfusions, patients transfused only for active bleeding received fewer platelet transfusions during the 30-day period after randomization, but had a higher incidence of major bleeding (50 versus 43 percent) and a shorter time to first bleed (1.2 versus 1.7 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There were no differences in the duration of hospitalization, and no deaths due to bleeding. In a predefined subgroup analysis, patients undergoing autologous HCT had similar rates of major bleeding whether they were transfused for a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span> or only for active bleeding (45 and 47 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter observational study which included 789 patients transplanted in 1995 at 18 centers in the United States and Canada, 11 percent of all patients had a significant hemorrhagic event during the first 60 days following the transplant, contributing to death in 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most hemorrhagic events (66 percent) occurred when the morning platelet count was <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;20,000/microL</span>. Variables associated with accelerated platelet recovery included a higher CD34+ cell count of the infused hematopoietic stem cell product, a higher platelet count at the start of myeloablative therapy, and a graft from an HLA-identical sibling donor. Variables associated with delayed platelet recovery included prior radiation therapy, post-transplant fever, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, the presence of graft-versus-host disease, CMV infection, cell dose, and the use of post-transplant growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>These results suggest that prophylactic transfusion for patients with platelets <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span> is reasonable. Further enhancing platelet recovery is not likely to have a significant impact on 60-day mortality but could significantly decrease health care costs and potentially improve patient quality of life. Similar conclusions have been reached in studies of patients who became thrombocytopenic after allogeneic HCT or following chemotherapy for acute leukemia; reducing the platelet transfusion threshold from 20,000 or <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> led to decreased use of platelet transfusions without any significant effect on morbidity and only a small adverse effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] or no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] on bleeding. The choice of stem cell source also impacts platelet recovery with a more rapid recovery following peripheral blood progenitor cells than with bone marrow transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Currently, there are very few if any clinical indications for granulocyte transfusions outside of a clinical trial setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=granulocyte-transfusions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Granulocyte transfusions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GROWTH FACTOR SUPPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cloned hematopoietic growth factors that have been explored in the transplant setting include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), erythropoietin (EPO), and thrombopoietin (TPO).

Therapy is usually begun one to five days after transplantation and continued until the absolute neutrophil count reaches <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL;</span> however, a shorter duration until clinically adequate neutrophil recovery is achieved is a reasonable alternative. Subcutaneous injection is preferred to intravenous injection when either agent is used due to improved pharmacokinetics and the suggestion of improved efficacy in one small randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Given the limited general utility of colony-stimulating factors following allogeneic transplantation, and the fact that their use may have been deleterious in some allogeneic settings, there appears to be little reason to routinely treat allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients with these growth factors as post-treatment prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Exceptions include those patients with delayed neutrophil engraftment, a reduction in white blood cells due to infection or drug treatment, or those being treated with umbilical cord blood as a stem cell source.

In this study, which included both patients receiving BM and PBPCs, G-CSF shortened the neutropenic period following transplantation but did not affect treatment-related mortality, acute or chronic GVHD, or leukemia-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythropoietin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythropoietin (EPO) has been used in an effort to accelerate the recovery of red blood cells. The rationale for this approach was provided in part by the observation that EPO levels were lower than predicted for the degree of anemia following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Instead, EPO is generally reserved for those patients with prolonged anemia (eg, transfusion requirements after day 28) and those who develop recurrent anemia after an initial hemoglobin recovery. &#160; </p><p>Initial small trials suggested that EPO administration produced more rapid recovery of red blood cells and reduced transfusional requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. Randomized trials that used variable doses and schedules of EPO have had mixed results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One such trial randomly assigned 215 patients receiving allogeneic HCT recipients to receive placebo or EPO (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per day as a continuous infusion) from bone marrow infusion until stable hemoglobin levels were achieved for seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The median time to transfusion independence was reduced from 27 to 19 days, but transfusion requirements for the two groups as a whole were similar. There were, however, subsets at high risk for transfusion (eg, GVHD III and IV) in which EPO reduced transfusion requirements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another trial from Australia evaluated 91 patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation followed by randomization to placebo or EPO (300 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> three times weekly) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. There was no reduction in transfusion requirements, although EPO therapy was associated with increases in the reticulocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, and bone marrow erythropoiesis on day 14.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third trial, 131 patients undergoing allogeneic HCT were randomly assigned to receive placebo or EPO (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> weekly) as part of one of three cohorts: myeloablative HCT with placebo or EPO starting on day 28; nonmyeloablative HCT with placebo or EPO starting on day 28; or nonmyeloablative HCT with placebo or EPO starting on day 0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. EPO was associated with a lower percentage of patients requiring transfusion (42 verus 77 percent) and fewer units transfused per patient (4.1 versus 6.9 units). Patients who received EPO were also more likely to have attained a hemoglobin &ge;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> by day 126 (63 versus 8 percent, median 90 days versus not reached). Among those undergoing nonmyeloablative HCT, there was no additional benefit to starting the EPO at day 0 when compared with day 28.</p><p/><p>Post-transplant anemia may be multifactorial and impacted by transplant complications (eg, GVHD) and medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>).

The development of antibodies, resulting in significant thrombocytopenia, has limited the development of these products.

Hematopoiesis can be derived entirely from the donor (ie, complete chimerism), can contain a variable ratio of donor- to recipient-derived cells (ie, mixed chimerism), or be derived entirely from the recipient (ie, engraftment failure). Studies can be performed on the blood or bone marrow and can evaluate total chimerism and chimerism in subsets including granulocytes, and T, B, NK, and CD34+ cells, where clinically appropriate. Chimerism studies help to assess engraftment, potential graft failure, and early relapse, and drive major therapeutic decisions including modifications to immunosuppression post-HCT.</p><p>Several methods have been used to assess chimerism after HCT, including determination of short tandem repeats (STR) by quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), and, in the setting of gender-mismatched transplants, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the Y chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Chimerism studies rely on the identification of unique DNA fragments in both the donor and the recipient using pre-transplant samples. The post-transplant sample is then assessed for the presence of these unique identifiers. Graft rejection or graft failure is identified when the post-transplant sample lacks the donor-specific DNA fragment. The recipient-specific DNA fragment provides a measurement of residual recipient-derived hematopoiesis. &#160;</p><p>Chimerism is usually expressed as a percent with 100 percent chimerism reflecting &quot;complete chimerism&quot; with all hematopoiesis being of donor origin. Acceptable levels depend on the underlying condition <span class=\"nowrap\">(inherited/acquired</span> benign condition versus malignant), the type of transplantation (myeloablative versus reduced <span class=\"nowrap\">intensity/nonmyeloablative),</span> timing of the study, the clinical situation (eg, suspected disease relapse), and results from prior studies. Stable mixed chimerism of 10 to 20 percent may be sufficient for certain marrow failure disorders. In contrast, increasing levels of mixed chimerism may precede overt relapse in patients with hematopoietic malignancy. Currently, there are no reliable strategies to enhance donor specific chimerism in the setting of mixed chimerism. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H875843\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virtually all patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) require blood product support in the form of red blood cell and platelet transfusions until the transplanted marrow cells engraft sufficiently to support hematopoiesis.
