But the pain is not as bad and might happen only during a bowel movement. Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red, itchy skin near the anus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pus draining from the anus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16325852\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for anal abscesses or fistulas?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for an anal abscess or a fistula, your doctor or nurse will look at your anus and do a &quot;digital rectal exam.&quot; During a digital rectal exam, your doctor or nurse will put a gloved finger into your anus and rectum to feel for lumps or anything abnormal.</p><p>He or she might also order an &quot;imaging test,&quot; such as an MRI or a CT scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16325869\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people feel better if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take &quot;sitz&quot; baths &ndash; This is a shallow, warm bath that helps clean and heal the anal area. Take them twice a day for 30 minutes each.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a hand-held shower to gently spray the anal area</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16325884\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an anal abscess treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To treat an abscess, your doctor will cut a small hole to drain out the pus. Often, this can be done in a doctor's office. If you have a large or deep abscess, you might need to be treated in a hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16325899\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an anal fistula treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To treat a fistula, your doctor will cut open the tunnel to take out the pus and help it heal.
