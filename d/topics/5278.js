DSL complements the preoperative assessment of radiographic imaging, which has limitations for identifying regional extension of the primary tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metastatic disease, such as peritoneal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The general principles and approach for performing a DSL for patients with a primary digestive malignancy are reviewed here.

DSL is cost effective if unresectable disease is identified and the patient is spared a laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, DSL performed routinely increases the overall cost of the operative procedure. Patient selection is based on primary tumor site and is discussed below.

It is not performed unless the treatment plan will be altered. Other contraindications include inability to tolerate laparoscopy and previously confirmed metastatic or unresectable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971261\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section reviews the basic surgical principles for performing a diagnostic staging laparoscopy (DSL). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971269\"><span class=\"h2\">Incision placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The access point for the initial trocar placement should be remote from prior surgical incisions or suspected metastatic disease. Open techniques, Veress needle insufflation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> optical ports can be utilized at the discretion of the surgeon. An overview of the techniques for laparoscopic surgery is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971277\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging procedure</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91039794\"><span class=\"h3\">One- versus two-stage approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two approaches to utilizing DSL. The first is to perform DSL as the sole intended procedure. The advantage of this approach includes identifying patients who may be more appropriately treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy as the first cancer treatment. The disadvantage is that a second procedure will be required for the definitive cancer operation.</p><p>The second approach involves performing DSL first, in the same setting where the definitive cancer operation will be performed if no unresectable <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distant disease is identified. The advantage of this approach includes one operative setting with one anesthetic administration. The disadvantages include the possible uncertainty of a frozen section report on a biopsy, need for final pathology to confirm a suspicious finding, and operating room time scheduling.</p><p>For any patient with a suspicion for metastatic or otherwise unresectable disease that cannot be confirmed with laparoscopy, conversion to an open laparotomy should be performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971285\"><span class=\"h3\">Collection of fluid for cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with ascites, fluid is sampled for cytologic analysis. Peritoneal washing in patients with primary digestive malignancy without ascites is typically not performed, except for patients with esophagogastric junction cancers. (See <a href=\"#H4972548\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971299\"><span class=\"h3\">Exploratory principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic exploration should be performed in an orderly fashion, evaluating for distant, regional, and local disease as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After obtaining access into the peritoneal cavity, a generalized exploration of the peritoneal surfaces of the abdominal cavity is performed. An angled 30 or 45&deg; laparoscope will aid in evaluation of surfaces in the pelvis, colic gutters, and the initial survey of the surface of the liver. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging studies after bariatric surgery&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough assessment of the local and regional sites should be performed next. For example, the gastrocolic ligament is divided in order to obtain entry into the lesser sac for evaluation of primary pancreatic and gastric malignancies. Abnormal lymphadenopathy should be adequately sampled via the laparoscope. A single suspicious lymph node should be resected in its entirety if technically possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finally, a complete evaluation of the liver surface is performed using a combination of altered patient positioning and offsetting the angled laparoscope. Intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound of the liver can be performed expeditiously to aid in identification of metastatic disease (see <a href=\"#H22894891\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopic ultrasound'</a> below). Alteration in patient positioning and port placement will assist with the ultrasound evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging studies after bariatric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971337\"><span class=\"h3\">Biopsies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsies are performed on suspicious lesions. If DSL is performed immediately before the planned definitive resection, a frozen section is obtained. Otherwise, the biopsy tissue is submitted for a final histologic evaluation. </p><p>Minimizing the use of electrocautery at the time of the biopsy will minimize thermal artifact effect. Laparoscopic graspers, cup biopsy forceps, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scissors can be used to aid in sampling of tissue. If metastatic disease is confirmed on the frozen section and no palliative procedure is indicated, the operation is concluded. </p><p>If the frozen section results are uncertain, ideally, histologic confirmation with permanent hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of tissue or other special stains will be obtained, as needed, before proceeding with a definitive operative procedure. For those patients with inconclusive results from laparoscopic biopsies, several options are available, including a second pathologist evaluation, repeat laparoscopy, or proceeding to an open laparotomy with the intent for treatment if no metastatic disease is subsequently identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971366\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few additional risks associated with DSL, other than the general risks of laparoscopy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H922054\"><span class=\"h3\">Morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall morbidity and mortality rates of DSL for patients with primary digestive cancers are low in comparison to an open laparotomy. The morbidity associated with DSL for esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer patients ranges from 0 to 2.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>], while no mortality was related to DSL. In comparison, the operative morbidity and mortality rates of a diagnostic laparotomy for patients with unresectable gastric cancer range from 13 to 23 percent and 10 to 21 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Therefore, DSL can be performed safely to identify patients who are candidates for a primary resection versus other modalities of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971374\"><span class=\"h3\">Port site tumor implantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Port site tumor implantation following laparoscopic intervention for upper gastrointestinal malignancy is less than 1 percent, with a median time to occurrence of eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a review of 1650 procedures, almost all patients who developed a port site recurrence also had developed a local recurrence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distant disease. The contemporary risk of port site implantation is comparable to that of a laparotomy incision as the site of tumor implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Approaches suggested to reduce the risk of port site implantation include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place trocars perpendicular to the peritoneum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent carbon dioxide leakage around trocars</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize handling of tumor tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protect extraction sites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bag specimens intra-abdominally to avoid spillage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove entire lesion rather than an excisional biopsy if possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drain the peritoneal cavity before deflating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deflate the abdomen with trocars in place</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close the fascia of the trocar port site while avoiding liquid spillage into the wound</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971382\"><span class=\"h3\">False negative explorations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DSL is associated with a false negative rate ranging from approximately 6 to 40 percent, depending on the size and location of the primary cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The utility of LUS may be in identifying patients who are not candidates for a primary resection because of misdiagnosis or misinterpretation of radiographic imaging. No randomized trials or large reviews have been performed to determine if LUS offers a significant advantage over laparoscopy alone for detecting of unresectable disease.</p><p>In our institution, we use LUS for planning a resection of primary and metastatic liver cancer. We also use LUS to plan the appropriate tissue margins of resection and evaluate for occult disease prior to performing a laparoscopic resection of gastric and pancreatic cancers.</p><p>The following studies illustrate the utility of LUS in staging pancreatic and hepatobiliary cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 53 patients with pancreatic cancer, LUS altered management in 28 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The positive predictive value of LUS for determining resectability was 91 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 50 consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], there was no significant difference for sensitivity, specificity, or overall accuracy between preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan and LUS, and the false negative rate for the DSL component of the study was 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of 75 patients with presumed pancreatic cancer and no evidence of regional or distant disease by good-quality preoperative imaging, LUS found three patients to have no pancreatic mass,; two patients with chronic pancreatitis; and five patients with sarcomas, lymphoma, or ampullary cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Only 53 percent were confirmed to be suitable for resection, and only 15 of 36 patients (42 percent) who underwent a laparotomy were resected. Overall, 44 percent of patients were spared an open laparotomy based on the LUS findings.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7185906\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY AND YIELD FOR SPECIFIC DISEASE SITES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional imaging studies (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computed tomography [CT] scan) often understage the intra-abdominal extent of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the setting of a negative high-quality radiographic preoperative evaluation, diagnostic staging laparoscopy (DSL) performed prior to a planned major resection may spare the patient an unnecessary laparotomy and decrease the time to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. </p><p>Accuracy of DSL is defined as the number of unresectable patients detected by DSL divided by the total number of unresectable cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Yield is defined as the number of unresectable patients detected by DSL divided by the total number of patients undergoing DSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The yield <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accuracy of DSL for primary digestive cancers are illustrated by the following disease specific examples.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4972548\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to limit aggressive treatment to patients with locally advanced disease, diagnostic laparoscopy is sometimes performed to detect occult intraperitoneal metastases in patients with distal esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Patients with adenocarcinoma arising from the intra-abdominal segment (ie, Siewert type II or III) are particularly prone to developing intraperitoneal metastasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101001\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101001 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Intraperitoneal metastases are notoriously difficult to diagnose noninvasively by either CT or positron emission tomography (PET). </p><p>A review of 195 patients with esophageal cancer, including proximal, middle, middle and distal, and distal esophageal cancer locations, found that the DSL altered treatment plans in 29 patients (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. No patient with a proximal or middle esophageal cancer had unresectable or treatment-altering disease identified. However, 17 percent of patients with a distal esophageal cancer had regional or metastatic disease identified, which altered the initial treatment plan. </p><p>In our institution, DSL is performed in patients with equivocal radiographic imaging with suspicion for metastatic disease but a nondiagnostic fine needle aspiration. In addition, patients with esophagogastric junction cancers, but not proximal and mid-esophageal cancer, routinely undergo DSL. Our practice is consistent with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which considers DSL useful in select patients, especially those with Siewert II or III tumors, for detecting radiographically occult metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Patients who have a positive peritoneal cytology or biopsy should <strong>not</strong> proceed to an esophagectomy with a curative intent, as the prognosis of such patients is dismal with or without surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis, staging, and treatment of esophageal cancer are further discussed elsewhere.

When large tumors (T3 or T4) only are considered, the diagnostic accuracy increases. A prospective study of 100 patients undergoing DSL found peritoneal spread <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver metastases in 21 patients, all of whom had T3 or T4 locally advanced cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The positive and negative predictive values for resectability were 96 and 50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Laparoscopy, while more invasive than CT or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), has the advantage of directly visualizing the liver surface, the peritoneum, and local lymph nodes. Between 20 and 30 percent of patients who have disease that is beyond T1 stage on EUS will be found to have peritoneal metastases despite having a negative CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. The risk of finding occult peritoneal dissemination is even higher for certain subsets of patients, including those with advanced (T4) primary tumors, or a linitis plastica appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In such cases, performance of a diagnostic laparoscopy may alter management (typically by avoiding an unnecessary laparotomy) in up to one-half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. As noted previously, the sensitivity of PET scans for the detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis is only approximately 50 percent.

In most (but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]) series this is a poor prognostic sign, even in the absence of overt peritoneal dissemination, and predicts for early peritoneal relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. The majority of patients who are found to have peritoneal disease on laparoscopy will never require a laparotomy or resection. However, at some institutions (including our own), positive peritoneal cytology in the absence of other evidence of intra-abdominal disease is an indication for neoadjuvant therapy. </p><p>At our institution, we routinely obtain peritoneal washings during laparoscopy in patients who lack visible peritoneal disease and refer patients with positive cytology in the absence of other evidence of metastatic disease for neoadjuvant approaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy'</a>.) </p><p>Some experts suggest that all patients with EUS stage <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/4</span> disease should undergo staging laparoscopy, but not those with earlier-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, we believe it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate T2 and T3 lesions on EUS. In keeping with consensus-based guidelines from the NCCN, our practice is to use preoperative staging laparoscopy for any medically fit patient who appears to have more than a T1 lesion on EUS, no histologic confirmation of stage IV disease, and who would not otherwise require a palliative gastrectomy because of symptoms. Diagnostic laparoscopy is especially important for patients who are being considered for neoadjuvant therapy trials. </p><p>Many patients with gastric cancer present with bleeding or obstruction and require, at the minimum, a palliative procedure. For those with obstructive symptoms only, endoscopic stenting in conjunction with DSL can be used to provide appropriate palliation and diagnosis and spare patients an unnecessary laparotomy, unless image-guided percutaneous biopsy can be performed in lieu of DSL to establish a cancer diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enteral stents for the palliation of malignant gastroduodenal obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis, staging, and accuracy of radiographic imaging are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer&quot;</a>).

Periampullary (peripancreatic) cancers include the ducts of the head and uncinate process of the pancreas, the ampulla of Vater, the distal common bile duct, and the area of the ductal insertion site in the duodenum. Many studies evaluating the yield of DSL have not differentiated pancreatic from nonpancreatic periampullary cancers.</p><p>Assessment of the regional extent of retroperitoneal disease by conventional radiographic imaging is limited. However, DSL may not be beneficial for every patient with a suspected pancreatic or periampullary malignancy staged with high-quality radiographic imaging. The accuracy of CT imaging ranges from 84 to 100 percent for predicting unresectability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>] but is limited in its ability to predict resectability of pancreatic cancers, with failures occurring in 11 to 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/39,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43-46</a>]. DSL has a greater than 90 percent accuracy for predicting resectability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/5,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,38,39</a>].</p><p>Meta-analysis of mostly low-quality studies of patients with pancreatic cancer found that 4 to 21 percent could have avoided an open laparotomy if they had undergone a DSL following CT imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Standard DSL offered limited information regarding involvement of major blood vessels (eg, portal vein, superior mesenteric artery) in retroperitoneal tumors. When DSL was extensive and opened all surgical resection planes, 13 percent (14 of 108) of patients had unresectable vascular encasement and thus were not resectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Despite the extensive approach, DSL failed to identify metastatic lesions to the liver in five patients and portal vein encasement in another patient in the remaining 61 patients who had a laparotomy in preparation for a resection.</p><p>Other studies suggest that patients with cancers of the body or tail of the pancreas are more likely to benefit from DSL than those with a pancreatic head cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/2,39,47,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,39,47,49,50</a>]. DSL identified occult disease twice as frequently with cancers in the pancreatic body or tail compared with cancers in the pancreatic head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Reasons for this difference may be related to the larger tumor size of cancers in the pancreatic body and tail and spread to the peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>There appears to be little advantage of performing DSL for periampullary cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/39,40,46,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,46,51-54</a>]. Unnecessary laparotomy was avoided in only 2.3 percent of patients with nonpancreatic periampullary cancer compared with 35 percent for patients with cancer in the body and tail of the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The reasons for this finding are unclear.</p><p>In our institution, we perform a DSL for all patients with a pancreatic body or tail cancer and for other patients when radiographic imaging is suspicious and a fine needle aspiration performed under radiographic guidance is inconclusive. We do not routinely perform DSL for patients with periampullary cancers or for cancers in the head of the pancreas.
