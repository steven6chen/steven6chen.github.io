(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Activation of eosinophils and other mononuclear white cells plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of AIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], and case series describe the presence of eosinophils in the renal interstitium on histologic examination along with macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The demonstration of urinary eosinophils has been proposed as a noninvasive test to aid in the diagnosis of AIN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DETECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eosinophils can be detected in the urine by applying stains that attach to their cytoplasmic granules. The three most commonly used stains are the Wright's, Giemsa, and Hansel's stains, and the last is the most effective at staining eosinophils in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The presence of more than 1 percent eosinophils of the total white cells in the urine is considered a positive test by any of these three stains.</p><p>However, the available data suggest that the presence of urinary eosinophils lacks the necessary test characteristics to definitively confirm or exclude a diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eosinophiluria can be found in a variety of conditions other than acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), including transplant rejection, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, cystitis, atheroembolic disease, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. As an example, eosinophiluria was demonstrated to be present in 4 percent of 148 consecutive hospitalized patients with pyuria (&gt;5 white blood cells per high-power field), none of whom was clinically suspected to have AIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among 51 patients who were suspected to have AIN, eosinophiluria was present in 6 of 15 (40 percent) patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AIN and 10 of 36 (30 percent) with another renal diagnosis. Another report suggests that eosinophiluria is found in 90 percent of individuals with an ileal conduit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The reported sensitivity and specificity of urinary eosinophils vary widely, probably related in part to differences in the definition of AIN since most reports lack the &quot;gold standard&quot; test (eg, kidney biopsy) against which to compare urinary eosinophils. In fact, many studies have used the clinical impression of consulting nephrologists as the gold standard.</p><p>However, in one study that utilized registry data from a single center, 566 patients with both urine eosinophils (measured by Hansel's stain) and native kidney biopsy performed within one week of each test were analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Ninety-one of the 566 patients had biopsy-proven AIN. The performance characteristics of urine eosinophils for AIN remained poor, with a sensitivity of 30.8 percent and specificity of 68.2 percent when using the definition of &ge;1 percent as a positive test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In addition, the available series use stains with varying efficacy at identifying the cytoplasmic granules in eosinophils (eg, Hansel's stain, Wright's stain, or both). Using a definition of &ge;1 percent urinary eosinophils, the sensitivity and specificity eosinophiluria for the identification of AIN vary depending on the type of stain used. Eosinophiluria for the identification of AIN has a sensitivity and specificity of 63 to 91 percent and 85 to 93 percent, respectively, using Hansel's stain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/6,7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,14</a>], and a sensitivity and specificity of 11 to 89 percent and 52 to 93 percent, respectively, using Wright's stain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other clinical conditions that have eosinophiluria can usually be distinguished from AIN by the clinical history, including the absence of drugs associated with AIN and the presence of urine sediment findings typical for the other conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is typically associated with red cells and red cell casts in the urine sediment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with prostatitis complain of dysuria and have normal renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal atheroemboli occur in patients with severe atheromatous disease, usually after aortic manipulation. Signs of other systemic emboli are also frequently present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of renal atheroemboli&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic accuracy of urinary eosinophils is limited. Although eosinophiluria may help suggest a diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in patients, a positive finding may be seen with other conditions, and a negative finding does not exclude the diagnosis.</p><p>Thus, it would be a mistake to overemphasize this finding, and the interpretation of a finding of urinary eosinophils must be made in conjunction with the other historical and laboratory clues. A kidney biopsy remains the definitive diagnostic test for AIN and should be strongly considered when contemplating treatment for AIN with immunosuppressive medications.
