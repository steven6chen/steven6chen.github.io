A finger fracture is when a person breaks a finger bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69018\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69018 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are different types of fractures. The type of fracture depends on how the bone breaks and whether the broken bone sticks out of the skin or not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362436\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a finger fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a finger fracture include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness of the hand</p><p/><p>A finger fracture can also make the finger bent in an abnormal position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362451\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and do an X-ray.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362466\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to reduce swelling?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. For the first 1 to 2 days after your injury, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to keep your finger raised above the level of your heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362481\"><span class=\"h1\">How are finger fractures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of finger fracture you have and how severe it is.</p><p>If you have a lot of pain or a severe fracture, your doctor will prescribe a strong pain medicine. If your fracture is mild, your doctor might recommend that you take an over-the-counter medicine for your pain. Over-the-counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p>Finger fractures are usually treated with a splint, &quot;buddy taping,&quot; or both. Buddy taping involves taping your injured finger to the finger next to it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82595\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82595 \">picture 1</a>). Before your doctor puts on a splint, he or she will make sure that your finger bones are in the correct position. If your bones are not in the correct position, he or she might need to do a procedure to put your bones in the correct position.</p><p>Severe fractures or fractures that involve the bone sticking out of the skin are usually treated by a specialist called a hand surgeon. Treatment for these types of fractures usually involves surgery. Your doctor might also prescribe an antibiotic medicine to prevent an infection if your bone is sticking out of your skin.</p><p>After your splint comes off, your doctor might recommend that you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert). He or she can show you exercises and stretches to strengthen your finger muscles and keep your fingers from getting stiff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362496\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do finger fractures take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures can take weeks to months to heal, depending on the type of fracture.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal very quickly. Older adults or adults with other medical problems can take much longer to heal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362511\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your fracture is healing. He or she will probably recommend that you eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>). He or she will also probably recommend that you avoid doing certain things. For example, he or she might recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid doing certain activities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoking. A fracture can take longer to heal if you smoke.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid damaging your cast or getting it wet, if you have a cast that shouldn't get wet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362526\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain, or your pain or swelling gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have numbness or tingling in your fingers, or your fingers look blue or purple.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You damage your cast or get it wet, and it's not supposed to get wet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25362541\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-finger-injuries-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common finger injuries (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-dislocation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Finger dislocation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
