Approximately 25 percent of breast cancers diagnosed in the United States (US) are DCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and over 60,000 women will be diagnosed in the US alone in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This increase is attributed primarily to the utilization of breast cancer screening by mammography. </p><p>DCIS is less common than invasive breast cancer, but, like with invasive breast cancer, the risk increases with age. DCIS is uncommon in women younger than 30. The rate of DCIS increases with age from 0.6 per 1000 screening examinations in women aged 40 to 49 years to 1.3 per 1000 screening examinations in women aged 70 to 84 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].

DCIS is also a component of the inherited breast-ovarian cancer syndrome defined by deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes; mutation rates are similar to those for invasive breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Similar to invasive breast cancer, DCIS tends to occur at a younger age in women with inherited BRCA mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Linear branching or segmental types of pleomorphic microcalcifications are frequently associated with high nuclear grade, comedo-type lesions, while fine, granular calcifications are primarily associated with low-grade, micropapillary, or cribriform lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, most patients diagnosed with DCIS have microcalcifications of indeterminate morphology. The advent of digital mammography has led to improved detection of microcalcifications and thus increased the number of women diagnosed with DCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
