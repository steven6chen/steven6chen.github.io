These infections can cause redness, pain, and swelling. The difference between them is that erysipelas tends to affect the upper layers of skin, and cellulitis tends to affect deep layers of skin and sometimes the fat under the skin.</p><p>Cellulitis and erysipelas can happen when germs get into the skin. Normally, different types of germs live on a person's skin. Most of the time, these germs do not cause any problems. But if a person gets a cut or a break in the skin, the germs can get into the skin and cause an infection.</p><p>Certain conditions can increase a person's chance of getting cellulitis or erysipelas. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a cut (even a tiny one)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having another type of skin infection or a long-term skin condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having swelling of the skin or swelling in the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being overweight</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1477091715\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cellulitis and erysipelas?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both types of infection cause very similar symptoms. Either infection can cause the infected area to be painful, red, swollen, or warm. Some people with cellulitis or erysipelas can sometimes also have fever or chills. And sometimes, people with these infections have no symptoms or only some of these symptoms.</p><p>Most of the time, cellulitis and erysipelas happen on the legs or arms. But people can get these infections in other places, such as the belly, the face, in the mouth, or around the anus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1477091722\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do not need any tests. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and look at your skin.</p><p>It's important for a doctor or nurse to do an exam to figure out what kind of infection you have. The right treatment for a skin infection depends on the type of infection it is and which germs are causing it. Your doctor or nurse might need to do tests to figure out the cause of your infection.</p><p>If you have cellulitis or erysipelas, it's important to get treated. These infections can spread to the whole body and become serious if not treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1477091729\"><span class=\"h1\">How are cellulitis and erysipelas treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These infections are treated with antibiotic pills. If your doctor prescribes medicine for you to take at home, it is important to follow the directions exactly. Take all of the pills you are given, even if you feel better before you finish them. If you do not take all the pills, the infection can come back worse.</p><p>People who have severe infections might be treated in the hospital and given antibiotics through a thin tube that goes into the vein, called an &quot;IV&quot;.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1477091736\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to help treat my infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise your arm or leg (if your infection is on your arm or leg) to reduce swelling &ndash; Raise the arm or leg up above the level of your heart 3 or 4 times a day, for 30 minutes each time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the infected area clean and dry &ndash; You can take a shower or bath, but be sure to pat the area dry with a towel afterward. Do not put any antibiotic ointments or creams on the area.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1477091743\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should call your doctor or nurse if your symptoms do not get better within 3 days of starting treatment. You should also call if the red area gets:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bigger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More swollen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More painful</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse might do another exam or tests to see if you need different medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1477091750\"><span class=\"h1\">Can skin infections be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. If you cut your skin, make sure to wash the area well with soap and water. This can help prevent the area from getting infected. If you have a long-term skin condition, ask your doctor or nurse what you can do to help prevent infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1477091757\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-and-soft-tissue-infection-cellulitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Skin and soft tissue infection (cellulitis) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
