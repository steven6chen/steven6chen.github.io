The system can be divided into two components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Natural immunity, which refers to the nonspecific immune response</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adaptive immunity, which refers to the response to a specific antigen</p><p/><p>In organ transplantation, the principal target of the immune response to the graft are the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells (allo-MHC); this feature is a form of adaptive immunity.</p><p>The immunobiology of solid transplantation will be reviewed here. The immunobiology of bone marrow or stem transplantation, which primarily involves graft-versus-host (GVH) and graft-versus-tumor effects, is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of the graft-versus-tumor effect following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To adequately understand the immune response to transplanted tissue, it is helpful to also review the general immune response; there will be an emphasis upon those elements involved in the response to donor antigens. More detailed discussions concerning various aspects of the immune system are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Natural or innate immunity refers to the older, nonspecific immune system that involves the recruitment and involvement of macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, cytokines, certain cellular receptors, and complement components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Physical damage and infective agents recruit a variety of inflammatory processes that do not involve recognition of specific antigens. However, they induce a robust inflammatory response due to the induction, presence, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> absence of specific features, such as the absence of complement inhibitory receptors on most foreign organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A detailed review of the innate immune system is provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, adaptive immunity involves recognition of specific antigen and confers both <strong>specificity</strong> and a <strong>memory</strong> effect by T and B lymphocytes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cells recognize antigen in the form of peptide bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B cells have immunoglobulin receptors that can recognize the antigenic portions of intact molecules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The natural and adaptive immune systems are closely interrelated. Antigen-specific T-cell activation leads to the production and secretion of cytokines and chemokines, which recruit components of the &quot;natural immune&quot; system as well as the specific mechanisms of alloantibody production and CD8-positive cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, local tissue production of complement components appears essential for full T-cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>An example of adaptive immunity involving B cells and its manipulation to permit transplantation involves ABO antigens. Previously, a classic contraindication to transplantation was the presence of ABO incompatibility between donor and possible recipient, a setting in which the presence of preformed donor-specific antibodies rapidly destroy an allograft. The principal method of circumventing this difficulty involves desensitization protocols, in which plasmapheresis, (possibly) splenectomy, and aggressive immunosuppressive regimens result in the removal of these antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and ABO sensitization and desensitization in renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, transplantation of such incompatible organs to infants, in whom humoral immunity has not yet developed, may also result in tolerance. This was reported in infants who have received and accepted ABO-incompatible hearts for several years, with evidence suggesting tolerance due to the deletion of donor-specific B-cell clones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The role of antibodies that target non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) endothelial cell antigens has long been suspected in solid organ transplantation. One study explored the relationship between antiendothelial cell antibodies and rejection in 226 kidney allograft recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although pre-existing antibodies were not associated with increased rejection or decreased <span class=\"nowrap\">recipient/graft</span> survival, de novo antibodies were associated with an increased risk of early acute rejection. Acute rejections were generally more severe and associated with glomerulitis and peritubular capillary inflammation. More patients with de novo antiendothelial antibodies developed graft dysfunction. A test to evaluate the presence of these antibodies is being developed (XM-ONE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">T-cell activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T-cell recognition of antigen is the primary event that initiates the effector mechanisms of the immune response. This key step requires the following two discrete signals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72231\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72231 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signal 1 is provided by the interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with antigen presented as a peptide by the antigen-presenting cell (APC).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signal 2 is provided by a costimulatory <span class=\"nowrap\">receptor/ligand</span> interaction on the <span class=\"nowrap\">T-cell/APC</span> cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>Once activated, T cells undergo clonal expansion under the influence of mitogenic growth and differentiation factors, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2).

The protein products of the MHC are expressed on the surfaces of a variety of cells. The human system is called human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and is analogous to the H-2 and RT1 systems in mice and rats, respectively.</p><p>These cell surface proteins are the principal antigenic determinants of graft rejection. Thus, organs transplanted between MHC-identical individuals are readily accepted, whereas organs transplanted between MHC antigen-mismatched individuals are inevitably rejected in the absence of immunosuppressive agents.</p><p>The normal biological role of these proteins was elucidated during the 1970s. It was discovered that antigen-specific T cells do not recognize antigen in free or soluble form or as intact protein. Instead, T cells recognize portions of protein antigens that have been fragmented into peptides bound to MHC molecules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, MHC molecules are a major component of the immune system as they provide the means for displaying antigenic peptides to T cells. T cells are exquisitely selected during development in the thymus to have moderate affinity with self-MHC molecules so that they may bind to antigenic peptides in the context of MHC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The protein products of the MHC have been classified into two major groups (class I and II). The structures of antigen-presenting MHC class-I and II molecules are similar. They each contain a beta-pleated sheet that provides a platform supporting two alpha-helical regions, thus forming a groove in which rests a peptide antigen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56966\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56966 \">figure 3</a>). The beta-pleated regions are relatively conserved as there is a great deal of sequence homology between individuals with different MHC genes. By comparison, the alpha-helical regions are more variable or polymorphic. All the polymorphisms contribute to the variable shapes of the peptide-binding groove and determine the motifs for peptide selection.</p><p>Immunogens are defined as foreign proteins that induce an immune response, with antigens being the targets of that response. In general, immunogens are also antigens. Such proteins tend to have defined regions of immunogenic amino acid sequences, termed epitopes, that may incite an immune response, as well as sequences that do not incite an immune response. The ability of an MHC molecule to bind antigen is determined by the amino acid side chain structure of both the MHC molecule and the peptide that binds to it. The physiochemical structure of the peptide-binding groove determines the type of peptides that may be bound.</p><p>MHC polymorphism exists as a consequence of the vertebrate evolutionary response to microbial invasion and ensures the continuity of species in the presence of pandemic infection. Thus, a few individuals within a species will survive a pandemic (such as plague) because of the protective effect of MHC gene polymorphisms, thereby ensuring the survival of the species even if the majority of individuals succumb to the illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Major histocompatibility complex class I and II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MHC class I and II molecules differ in structure, expression, and the cellular compartment from which they obtain antigenic peptides to present to T cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70970\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70970 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Class I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Class I MHC molecules contain two separate polypeptide chains:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MHC-encoded alpha chain, which is divided into three domains (a1, a2, and a3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-MHC-encoded beta chain, beta2 microglobulin</p><p/><p>The portion of the MHC class-I molecule that interacts with peptide antigen consists of the a1 and a2 domains, which comprise approximately 180 amino acids starting at the amino terminus. Structurally, this region is comprised of a platform of beta-pleated sheet that supports two parallel strands of alpha-helix, which together form the peptide-binding groove.</p><p>Class-I MHC molecules present cytoplasm-derived peptides that are representative of the normal components of the same cell or of intracellular parasites, principally viruses. Such proteins are degraded in the proteosome within the cytoplasm; the resultant peptide residues are transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum by <strong>T</strong>ransporters associated with <strong>A</strong>ntigen <strong>P</strong>resentation (TAP transporters). The final <span class=\"nowrap\">MHC/antigen</span> complex assembly then occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum before transportation to the cell surface.</p><p>Once on the cell surface, class-I MHC molecules present peptide antigens to <strong>CD8-positive T cells</strong>. The CD8-positive T cells subsequently induce cell lysis by either activating the cell's self-destruct cycle (inducing apoptosis) or actively killing the infected cell via the release of a number of cytotoxic proteins. As viral infection can occur in most nucleated mammalian cells, MHC class-I molecules are found on almost all cell types (except red blood cells), although the level of expression varies. Particularly high levels of class-I MHC expression are expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APC), including dendritic cells, macrophages, B lymphocytes, and vascular endothelial cells.</p><p>The nomenclature of MHC class-I proteins in different species is the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Humans &ndash; HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mouse &ndash; H-2 K, H-2 D, and H-2 L</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rat &ndash; RT1.A and RT1.E</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Class II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Class-II MHC molecules are alpha-beta heterodimers composed of noncovalently associated polypeptide chains. The two chains are similar in overall structure. Each chain contains a relatively conserved beta-pleated sheet region as well as a more polymorphic alpha-helical region.</p><p>The antigen-binding region of the class-II molecule is formed by an eight-stranded, pleated-sheet platform supporting two alpha-helices that make up the walls of the antigen-binding cleft, thereby resulting in an overall structure that is similar to that of class-I MHC. As with class-I molecules, genetic polymorphisms of class-II MHC molecules determine the chemical surface of the cleft and are the principal determinants of the specificity and affinity of peptide binding and T-cell recognition.</p><p>MHC class-II molecules bind peptides derived from <strong>extracellular</strong> (exogenous) proteins. Within the endocytoplasmic reticulum, the alpha and beta chains are associated, although the antigen-binding groove is initially filled and protected by an invariant chain. The invariant chain is degraded once proper folding has occurred, resulting in the release of a class-II associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP). Meanwhile, exogenous proteins that have been endocytosed and fragmented are transferred to the &quot;compartment for peptide loading&quot; (CPL), where they displace the CLIP from the MHC antigen-binding groove. The tripartite structure (MHC alpha and beta chain with peptide) is then brought to the cell surface, where it is presented to <strong>CD4-positive T cells</strong>.</p><p>Class-II MHC molecules are expressed constitutively only on the surface of interstitial dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Epithelial cell and vascular endothelial cell MHC class-II expression is strongly upregulated after exposure to a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, which include interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-g).</p><p>The nomenclature used to describe MHC class-II proteins in different species is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Humans &ndash; HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rat &ndash; RT1.H, RT1.B, and RT1.D</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mouse &ndash; I-A and I-E</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MINOR TRANSPLANTATION ANTIGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immune response that develops in response to donor tissue is primarily directed against the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. In contrast, <strong>minor</strong> histocompatibility antigens were initially described in the mouse as non-MHC-encoded histocompatibility differences that led to allograft rejection. The tempo of rejection in mice that are mismatched for minor, but not major, antigens is slower compared with that observed with MHC incompatibility.</p><p>Minor antigens are derived from polymorphic cellular proteins bound to MHC class I of the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Such antigens, for example, may be encoded by the Y chromosome in males (H-Y) and may thus induce an alloimmune response if male tissue is transplanted into a female recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another possibility is that the peptide antigen may be autosomally derived and represent polymorphisms among autosomal proteins or enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>These minor antigens are generally peptides recognized by T cells in the context of self-MHC and are most often recognized by CD8-positive T cells that are cytotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a mouse model, slight modification of such a minor antigen resulted in the manufacture of regulatory T cells that aided tolerance induction, suggesting that chronic low-level stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) may promote tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Minor antigens do not induce alloantibody responses.</p><p>In bone marrow transplantation, minor antigens play an important role in graft-versus-host (GVH) disease in six-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched individuals. In this setting, donor MHC that is identical to that of the recipient presents minor antigen in the context of &quot;self-MHC,&quot; thereby enhancing the GVH response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ALLORECOGNITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T-cell recognition of alloantigen is the primary and central event that leads to the cascade of events that result in rejection of a transplanted organ. Individual T cells (or colonies of identical T-cell clones) are monospecific as they recognize only a single peptide antigen presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Such clones are further defined on the basis of the identity of their TCR, their phenotype (CD4 or CD8 positive), and the pattern of cytokines produced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are at least two distinct, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, pathways of allorecognition, the direct and indirect pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64598 \">figure 4</a>). Each leads to the generation of different sets of allospecific T-cell clones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the direct pathway, host T cells recognize intact allo-MHC molecules on the surface of the <strong>donor</strong> or stimulator cell. Since MHC molecules that lack bound peptide are unstable and are therefore unrecognizable by T cells, peptides derived from endogenous proteins that are bound into the groove of the donor MHC play a role in this mode of allorecognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Direct allorecognition by T cells of intact surface MHC molecules has <strong>not</strong> been demonstrated outside of alloimmunity, so it is this phenomenon that uniquely distinguishes alloimmunity from ordinary immunity to micro-organisms. This pathway is thought to be the <strong>dominant</strong> pathway involved in the early alloimmune response as the relative number of T cells that proliferate on contact with allogeneic or donor cells is extraordinarily high compared with the number of clones that target antigen presented by self-antigen-presenting cell (APC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Thus, direct allorecognition is of major importance in acute allorejection. The transplanted organ carries a variable number of passenger APCs in the form of interstitial dendritic cells. Such APCs have a high density of allo-MHC molecules and are capable of directly stimulating the recipient's T cells.</p><p>&quot;Professional APCs&quot; also provide the necessary costimulatory signals for full T-cell activation. Parenchymal cells, which may express donor MHC antigens, are frequently deficient in costimulatory molecules and are less able to fully activate T cells (&quot;nonprofessional APCs&quot;). However, evidence in transgenic animals suggests that some nonprofessional APCs, particularly vascular endothelial cells, may be sufficient to activate T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Overall, the corollary of this hypothesis is that, as donor-origin APCs are depleted over time after engraftment, the relative contribution provided by the direct pathway to the alloimmune response may dwindle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Indirect pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the indirect pathway, T cells recognize processed alloantigen presented as peptides by <strong>self</strong>-APCs (host-APCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The basic premise for indirect allorecognition as a mechanism involved in allograft rejection is that donor MHC molecules are shed from the graft, taken up by recipient APCs, and then presented to T cells.</p><p>Despite the misleading name, this pathway corresponds to the normal system of antigen recognition whereby the host's immune system recognizes foreign or exogenously derived peptide as presented by self-MHC (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>). Numerous experimental studies have indicated that, in general, the dominant epitopes are mostly confined to the hypervariable regions that encode the peptide-binding regions of the MHC molecule (see above). By comparison, the nonpolymorphic regions (structural regions) are relatively silent immunologically.</p><p>In the setting of organ transplantation, peptides corresponding to polymorphic regions of the MHC induce a strong alloimmune response, whereas nonpolymorphic peptides fail to induce such a response. Whether a given section of MHC is immunogenic depends upon its amino acid sequence and on the structure of the MHC molecules in which it is itself presented. There is increasing interest in this &quot;indirect&quot; pathway as peptide antigens are relatively simple structures that can be readily synthesized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>This novel experimental approach permits the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of allograft rejection, which has led to several important findings. Allopeptide-reactive T cells are present during both acute and chronic rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Although primary immune responses are characterized by T-cell-proliferative responses to a limited number of immunogenic MHC allopeptides, secondary responses such as those that occur in <strong>chronic or late acute rejection</strong> are associated with T-cell-proliferative responses to a more variable repertoire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This repertoire includes responses to peptides that were previously immunologically silent.</p><p>Such a change in the pattern of T-cell responses has been termed epitope switching or spreading and can occur to peptides representing alternative regions within a given MHC hypervariable region (intramolecular spreading) or to peptides representing different MHC chains (intermolecular spreading) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The precursor frequency of such MHC allopeptide reactive T cells is typically low, as evidenced by studies in humans with chronic renal allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, such a finding is not unexpected given the indolent nature of chronic rejection. Since it is possible to assay donor-specific MHC allopeptide-specific T-cell activity, it may be possible to translate such information to clinical usefulness to predict rejection.</p><p>Studies have also provided a link between MHC allopeptide-primed T cells and the development of acute vascular-type rejection mediated in part by accelerated alloantibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Such studies also suggest that chronic allograft vasculopathy, the <em>sine qua non</em> of experimental chronic rejection, may be mediated by T cells primed by the indirect pathway.</p><p>In addition to the data that cast light on the molecular mechanisms underlying T-cell activation, MHC peptides may also be used therapeutically.

The largest families are the alpha and beta chemokines. The alpha-chemokine family is characterized by cysteine residues that are separated by a single amino acid (CXC), while the cysteine residues in beta chemokines are adjacent (CC). By comparison, lymphotoxin, a member of a third group, has only a single pair of cysteines. Chemokines are tethered to the cell membrane by highly sulphated anionic structures on glycosaminoglycans, particularly heparin and chondroitin-sulfates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Chemokines provide the signals that convert the low-affinity selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling into the integrin-mediated leukocyte-endothelial adhesion that presages transmigration.

In the resting cell, this molecule is found in a heterodimeric form in the cytoplasm bound to inhibitors of kB (IkBs).

Nonspecific inflammation also promotes the shedding of intact, soluble human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which may prime the indirect allorecognition pathway. Once activated, CD4-positive T cells initiate macrophage-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and provide help to B cells for alloantibody production.</p><p>CD8-positive T cells that mediate cell-mediated cytotoxicity reactions kill either by delivering a &quot;lethal hit&quot; or alternatively by inducing apoptosis. After encountering a class-I MHC molecule that is presenting antigen, the T cell secretes perforin, an inducer of pore formation, and granzyme B, a serine protease that activates the interleukin-1-beta converting enzyme (ICE) protease pathway, that together induce cell death. This pathway is probably dominant during microbial infections. Alternatively, the T cell may utilize the FAS pathway, which induces &quot;activation-induced cell death.&quot; The FAS pathway is of importance in limiting T-cell proliferation in response to antigenic stimulation. Cell-mediated cytotoxicity has been shown to play an important role in acute, although not chronic, allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>Detailed sequential immunohistologic as well as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies of chronically rejected allografts reveal gene upregulation of T cells and T-cell-derived cytokines (including interleukin-2 [IL-2] and interferon-gamma [IFN-g]) early after transplantation. Other, somewhat later events include expression of the beta-chemokines regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which precedes and promotes intense macrophage infiltration of the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. The potent smooth muscle and mesangial cell mitogen interleukin-6 (IL-6), the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, platelet-derived growth factor, and endothelin, are also expressed at approximately the same time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].</p><p>Endothelial cells that are activated by T-cell-derived cytokines and macrophages express class-II MHC, adhesion molecules, and costimulatory molecules, and they can present antigen and activate more T cells. Growth factors, including TGF-beta and endothelin, lead to smooth muscle cell proliferation, neointimal thickening, interstitial fibrosis, and, in the case of the kidney, glomerulosclerosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24500229\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immune response involved in organ transplantation is a form of adaptive immunity, or one in which the response is to a specific antigen. The principal targets of the immune are the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells (allo-MHC). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T-cell recognition of antigen is the primary event that initiates the immune response. This key step requires the interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with antigen presented as a peptide by the antigen-presenting cell (APC) and a costimulatory <span class=\"nowrap\">receptor/ligand</span> interaction on the <span class=\"nowrap\">T-cell/APC</span> cell surface. Activated T cells are directly cytotoxic and provide help for B-cell antibody production and macrophage-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'T-cell activation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteins encoded by the MHC are the principal antigenic determinants of graft rejection. Organs transplanted between MHC-identical individuals are readily accepted, whereas organs transplanted between MHC antigen-mismatched individuals are inevitably rejected in the absence of immunosuppressive agents. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Major histocompatibility complex structure and function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antigen-presenting protein products of the MHC have been classified into class I and II groups that are characterized by structure, expression, and the cellular compartment from which they obtain antigenic peptides to present to T cells. Class-I MHC molecules include human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B and HLA-C molecules and are found on all cell types except red blood cells. Class-I molecules present cytoplasm-derived peptide antigens to CD8-positive T cells, which induce cell lysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Class-II MHC molecules include HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR molecules. Class-II MHC molecules are constitutively expressed on interstitial dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, but expression may be upregulated on epithelial cell and vascular endothelial cell after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines. Class-II molecules present peptides derived from extracellular proteins to CD4-positive T cells. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Major histocompatibility complex class I and II'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The activation of costimulatory pathways is required for T-cell entry into the cell cycle. Multiple costimulatory molecules have been identified including CD28 and CD40. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of allorecognition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'T-cell costimulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocyte migration from the circulation to a site of inflammation involves four steps including selectin-mediated rolling, chemokine-mediated triggering, integrin-mediated firm adhesion, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)- and chemokine-mediated transmigration. Chemokine-regulated attraction of leukocytes to sites of tissue injury, infection, or allotransplantation is essential for the induction of the acute inflammatory response. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Leukocyte migration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T helper cells are divided into two distinct populations, type 1 (Th1) and type 2 (Th2) cells. Th1 cells produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-g) and induce macrophage activation, leading to DTH responses. Acute allograft rejection is predominantly mediated by a Th1 immune response. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Cytokines and T helper cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T-cell activation results in intracellular signalling that activates cytokine DNA promoter regions permitting transcription of mRNA. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Molecular mechanisms of T-cell activation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alloantigen-dependent and alloantigen-independent factors contribute to the effecter mechanisms underlying allograft rejection. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Effector mechanisms associated with allograft rejection'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transplantation-immunobiology/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wyburn KR, Jose MD, Wu H, et al.
