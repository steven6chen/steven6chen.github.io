They also have a role in the palliation of obstruction in other segments of the gastrointestinal tract such as the stomach, proximal small bowel, and colon (enteral stents).</p><p>In the Western world, malignant gastric outlet obstruction occurs most commonly from obstruction of the duodenum by pancreatic cancer. Other causes at the level of the duodenum include cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic disease. Malignant gastric obstruction at the level of the stomach due to gastric cancer (primary or postsurgical recurrence) is seen more commonly in Asian countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Patients being considered for stent placement should have a short life expectancy (less than two to six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Surgical palliation with a gastrojejunal anastomosis should be considered for patients with longer life expectancies (predicted by a WHO performance status of 0 to 2) because it offers better long-term relief compared with stent placement.</p><p>The goals of stent placement are to provide relief from obstructive symptoms, to allow the patient to resume a normal diet, and to improve the patient's quality of life. As such, stent placement is not indicated for patients with a gastric outlet obstruction who are asymptomatic and are tolerating a normal diet. Other contraindications to stent placement are the presence of multiple sites of small bowel obstruction (since stenting the proximal stricture is unlikely to provide symptom relief) and the presence of free perforation.</p><p>Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis are at high risk for incomplete palliation following stent placement given the risk of multiple sites of luminal obstruction. Despite this anecdotal experience, some data suggest that stents can work in such patients. In a retrospective study of 215 patients undergoing stent placement for malignant gastric outlet obstruction, 116 patients (60 percent) had carcinomatosis and 76 (40 percent) did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Outcomes were similar for those with and without carcinomatosis with regard to clinical success (81 versus 84 percent, respectively), need for reintervention (18 versus 27 percent, respectively), and major complications (4 percent for both groups).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRE-PROCEDURE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining a radiographic contrast study (computed tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance imaging with oral contrast or upper gastrointestinal series) to assess the anatomy, length of the stricture, and degree of obstruction may be helpful, especially in cases where it is unclear if the obstruction is clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the majority of patients will have had imaging (such as a CT scan) showing the extent of the lesion, thereby mitigating the need for additional imaging.</p><p>Prior to gastroduodenal stent placement, one should evaluate the status of the biliary tree. Coexistent biliary obstruction is commonly present since it typically develops earlier than gastric outlet obstruction (eg, patients with pancreatic cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. If there is known or impending biliary obstruction, a self-expandable metal biliary stent should be placed prior to placing the duodenal stent because it is difficult to obtain biliary tree access once a duodenal stent has been placed across the papilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. A percutaneous transhepatic or endoscopic ultrasound-guided approach may be required to treat a biliary obstruction that develops after duodenal stent placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF STENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duodenal self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) are used for the palliation of malignant gastroduodenal obstruction. SEMS may be covered or uncovered. Covered stents offer the advantage of less tumor ingrowth, but are more prone to migration than uncovered stents and are less flexible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Because of this, uncovered stents are generally used for the treatment of malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Uncovered stents are less prone to migration and are more flexible. In addition, uncovered stents allow for bile flow through the stent interstices in patients with previously placed biliary stents. Tumor ingrowth is more common with uncovered stents; thus, luminal obstruction may recur in patients who survive for more than six months after stent placement. Partially covered stents (with uncovered proximal and distal ends to decrease migration and with a covered middle portion to decrease tumor ingrowth) are in development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-expandable-stents-in-the-esophagus#H4130516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of expandable stents in the esophagus&quot;, section on 'Self-expandable metal stents'</a>.)</p><p>Duodenal stents available in the United States are all uncovered, have delivery systems of small diameter that can be passed through the working channel of a therapeutic endoscope, are long enough to be passed through a colonoscope, and are reconstrainable up to a certain point during deployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. These include the Wallstent Colonic and Duodenal Endoprosthesis, the WallFlex Duodenal Stent (Boston Scientific), and the Evolution Duodenal Stent (Cook Medical). The Wallstent Colonic and Duodenal Endoprosthesis is made from a composite material, Elgiloy, and is unflanged. It is available in diameters from 20 to 22 mm and in lengths of 6 and 9 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The WallFlex Duodenal Stent is composed of nitinol, which is more flexible than the alloy metals used in the Wallstent. The WallFlex stent has a diameter of 22 mm through its body, with a 27 mm proximal flare. It is available in lengths of 6, 9, and 12cm. </p><p>The Evolution Duodenal Stent is available in the United States. It is composed of nitinol and has lengths of 6, 9, and 12 cm. It is unique in that it has both proximal and distal flanges of 27 mm and has a midbody diameter of 22 mm. There are many other stents available outside the United States, some of which are covered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PLACEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H781465877\"><span class=\"h2\">Personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duodenal stents should be placed by experienced therapeutic endoscopists in a procedure room equipped with fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It is imperative to have a procedural assistant who is familiar with complex, therapeutic endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and self-expandable metal biliary stent placement.</p><p>The duration of the procedure is highly variable and depends upon the degree of difficulty encountered when traversing or accessing the stricture. At least 60 minutes should be allotted for the procedure after adequate sedation has been achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146133473\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedural sedation and patient preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moderate procedural sedation with an opiate (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>) and benzodiazepine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) is usually sufficient. The majority of patients can be discharged following the procedure without the need for hospitalization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients who are not endotracheally intubated, the patient should be placed in the left lateral decubitus or prone position to minimize the risk of aspiration due to retained gastric contents. Similarly, the supine position should be avoided unless the patient is endotracheally intubated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the gastric contents have been completely evacuated because of the high risk of aspiration. A prone position allows for a better anatomic view under fluoroscopy compared with the left lateral position. </p><p>Patients should take nothing by mouth for at least six hours prior to the procedure, and should not eat solid foods for at least eight hours prior to the procedure. However, since these patients have gastric outlet obstruction, gastric clearance times are prolonged. We initiate a clear liquid diet one or two days before the procedure to allow emptying of retained solids. Some authors suggest insertion of a nasogastric tube 24 to 48 hours prior to the procedure to decompress the stomach and remove gastric contents in the presence of complete gastric outlet obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Decompression of the stomach is important as placement of a duodenal stent can be significantly more challenging in the setting of a very dilated stomach. The nasogastric tube can be removed immediately prior to endoscopy and should not be required after stent placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146133437\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-deployment evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the endoscope is passed to the site of obstruction, a gentle attempt should be made to advance it through the obstruction. Excessive force or aggressive dilation of the stricture increases the risk of perforation and should be avoided in most cases, since stent placement can usually be performed without the endoscope traversing the obstruction. If the endoscope can traverse the obstruction, it should be used to measure the length of the obstruction, so that an appropriate stent can be chosen. If the endoscope is unable to pass through the lesion, the length of the obstruction can be determined fluoroscopically by simple contrast injection. Alternatively, an occlusion balloon catheter can be utilized. Using this accessory, the endoscope is positioned immediately proximal to the obstruction and the catheter is advanced beyond the obstruction. The balloon is inflated and retracted to the distal extent of the obstruction. The length of the obstruction can then be measured with fluoroscopy, or by measuring the length of catheter after retracting the deflated balloon. In cases where the goal is to reach the papilla for the treatment of concomitant biliary obstruction, the duodenal obstruction may need to be traversed. In such cases, dilation may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146133430\"><span class=\"h2\">Stent deployment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the endoscope passes easily through the lesion, a 0.035 inch guidewire with a floppy tip is placed through the endoscope channel and passed at least 20 cm distal to the obstruction and coiled in the small bowel. If the diameter of the endoscope channel is large enough to allow the stent delivery system to pass (ie, typically 3.7 mm or greater), the stent is placed over the guidewire and then advanced through the endoscope. It is then placed across the obstruction under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p>If the stent delivery system is too large to pass through the endoscope channel (eg, non-dedicated duodenal stents such as esophageal stents), a much stiffer 0.035 or 0.038 inch guidewire is placed and the endoscope is withdrawn, leaving the guidewire in place. The stent is then loaded onto the guidewire and advanced fluoroscopically to the obstruction. The endoscope can then be reinserted alongside the stent delivery system to allow direct endoscopic visualization during deployment.</p><p>If the endoscope cannot be passed easily through the lesion, a hydrophilic biliary guidewire preloaded through standard biliary accessories can be used to traverse the stricture, as is done during ERCP. Once the wire has passed through the stricture as demonstrated fluoroscopically (which can be recognized by the anatomically correct position of the wire passing into an air-filled distal bowel loop <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> injection of contrast), the catheter is advanced over the guidewire through the obstructing lesion. Water-soluble radiographic contrast is then injected to confirm proper position. The pre-deployed stent is passed over the guidewire and the procedure is continued as described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146133444\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-deployment evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the stent is fully deployed, the ends of the stent should be carefully inspected fluoroscopically. If either end of the stent is not flared or expanded to produce a &quot;waist&quot; within the obstructing lesion, the endoscopist should be suspicious that the chosen stent may be too short to completely traverse the length of the stricture. At this point, contrast can be injected into the stent to assess complete patency. If needed, a second (and rarely a third) overlapping stent can be placed to adequately treat the stricture. In general, if the endoscope does not need to be passed through the stent immediately after deployment (which may be required if the papilla needs to be accessed for management of the biliary tree), passage of the endoscope through the stent should be avoided. Passage of the endoscope through the stent before the stent has fully expanded may lead to stent displacement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34234103\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTPROCEDURE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete stent expansion usually occurs in 24 to 48 hours, although with very tight strictures, expansion may take longer or the stent may not fully expand. Patients are allowed to ingest liquids following the procedure and to then cautiously advance their diet to a low-residue diet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51448 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, there are limited data for guiding the optimal dietary approach and some patients can tolerate a normal diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with complete, prolonged obstruction may have a delay in return of normal gastric motility. In addition, factors such as neural involvement by tumor, prior gastric resection, and placement of the proximal end of the stent within the antrum rather than entirely in the duodenum may determine which diet can be tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stents can be placed successfully in over 90 percent of patients, with clinical success rates of typically 80 percent or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. Technical failure is usually due to the inability to pass a guidewire through the stricture, anatomic difficulties such as excessive looping within the dilated stomach, or complicated postsurgical anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Published experience with enteral stenting for gastroduodenal obstruction is derived mostly from observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/19,21-23,25-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21-23,25-35</a>], although small randomized trials have compared stent placement with surgical bypass for palliation of malignant gastric outlet obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/2,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of two trials of endoscopic stenting versus palliative gastrojejunostomy, six comparative studies, and 36 retrospective series, there were no statistically significant differences between the two procedures in terms of efficacy or complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

By comparison, the median time to stent dysfunction in patients who did not undergo duodenal stent placement was 170 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2717304446\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternatives to enteral stent placement for alleviation of symptoms include palliative surgical resection, surgical bypass (gastrojejunostomy) and radiation therapy, and these options are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Local palliation for advanced gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic options for local palliation'</a>.)</p><p>An endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastrojejunostomy has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This procedural technique allows endosonographic placement of a lumen-apposing metal stent (ie, Axios, Boston Scientific) to create a gastrojejunal anastomosis, which bypasses the gastroduodenal obstruction. In a study of 26 patients with gastric outlet obstruction (from both benign and malignant causes), technical success was achieved in 24 patients (92 percent) and clinical success was achieved in 22 patients (85 percent). Adverse events occurred in three patients (12 percent). While the data are promising, further studies comparing this approach to luminal stent placement are warranted prior to widespread adoption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant gastroduodenal obstruction can cause significant morbidity, including nausea, intractable vomiting, esophagitis, electrolyte imbalances, poor nutrition, and severe dehydration. Enteral stent placement can provide palliation without the morbidity associated with palliative surgery and may provide a better quality of life compared with other alternatives. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for stent placement include patients who have a short life expectancy (ie, less than two to six months). The goals of stent placement are to provide relief from obstructive symptoms, to allow the patient to resume a normal diet, and to improve the patient's quality of life. As such, stent placement is not indicated for patients who are asymptomatic and are tolerating a normal diet. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteral stents for the treatment of malignant gastroduodenal obstruction can be placed successfully in over 90 percent of patients, with clinical success rates of 80 percent or higher. Enteral stents for palliation are associated with less morbidity, procedure-related mortality, and cost compared with surgical palliation. However, 15 to 40 percent of patients require reintervention following stent placement for recurrent symptoms or biliary obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications can occur during or after stent placement. Intraprocedural adverse events include complications related to sedation, pulmonary aspiration, stent malposition, perforation, and bleeding. Late complications include distal stent migration, stent occlusion, bleeding, perforation, and fistula formation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-palliation-of-malignant-gastroduodenal-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Shone DN, Nikoomanesh P, Smith-Meek MM, Bender JS.
