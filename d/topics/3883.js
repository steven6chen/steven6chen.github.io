Myocellular damage results in myocardial dysfunction leading to heart failure. The clinical presentation can be acute or chronic. However, in contrast to adults, the majority of children with myocarditis present with acute or fulminant disease.</p><p>The incidence, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of myocarditis in children are reviewed here. The treatment and prognosis of myocarditis are discussed separately.

Infectious etiologies, particularly viral, are most common in children. The most common causes of viral myocarditis are enterovirus (coxsackie group B), adenovirus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes 6 (HHV-6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Rarely, pediatric myocarditis may be associated with autoimmune disorders and drug hypersensitivity. The etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis are presented in greater detail separately.

In a retrospective study from a single tertiary pediatric center, the estimated prevalence of myocarditis among children presenting to their emergency department was 0.5 cases per 10,000 visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In addition, the diagnosis can be difficult to establish given the nonspecific symptoms and lack of a sufficiently sensitive and specific diagnostic test for myocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H261467779\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A higher incidence of myocarditis is noted in autopsy studies of infants and children who died suddenly and unexpectedly; evidence of myocarditis was noted in approximately 10 to 20 percent of such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>].

Patients typically have a prodrome of fever, myalgia, and malaise several days prior to the onset of symptoms of heart dysfunction. At presentation, infants and children usually have signs and symptoms of heart failure that include dyspnea at rest, exercise intolerance, syncope, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hepatomegaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60553\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60553 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/1,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16-19</a>].

However, there was overlap between the two groups of patients, so a target level could not be ascertained to differentiate between the two conditions.

However, cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsy are not universally available to confirm a clinical diagnosis of myocarditis.

Previously we performed EMB on the majority of children with new symptoms of heart failure unrelated to structural heart disease (which is generally ruled out by echocardiography) with a history suggestive of myocarditis. If EMB is performed, it should be done early in the course of the disease and multiple samples are obtained to optimize diagnostic accuracy and reduce sampling errors.

During EMB, cardiac catheterization also provides important hemodynamic data that may help guide heart failure therapy.</p><p>We also perform cardiac MRI on the majority of patients with new onset of heart failure in the absence of structural heart disease. However, we have not yet moved to relying on cardiac MRI alone as a diagnostic modality, given that large pediatric studies are not yet available to determine sensitivity and specificity of this testing modality.</p><p>At our centers, the decision to perform these diagnostic tests is individually assessed for each patient based on the risk and benefit of the procedure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For EMB, the hemodynamic stability of the patient is evaluated including the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation during the procedure, and the size and thickness of the ventricular wall to assess the risk of cardiac perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although MRI is considered a noninvasive test, infants, small children, and those who are severely affected still require intubation and mechanical ventilation to facilitate required breath-holding sequences and reduce motion to improve imaging quality.

Chest radiography findings are nonspecific and include cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and, less commonly, pleural effusions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111231\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111231 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111232\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111232 \">image 2</a>); however, about half of affected patients have normal chest radiographs. In patients with suggestive findings, it is desirable to perform further testing (eg, endomyocardial biopsy [EMB] and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) that may confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis. However, these tests may not be readily available or may be inconclusive, in which case management decisions are made based on a clinical diagnosis that encompasses these findings.
