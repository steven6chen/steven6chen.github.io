Performance and interpretation of the urinalysis are practical skills for clinicians in both the ambulatory and hospital settings. In conjunction with the history, physical examination, and serum chemistries, the urinalysis plays a central role in evaluating acute and chronic kidney disease. In addition, abnormal findings on a routine urinalysis, often in an otherwise asymptomatic patient, may be the first evidence of underlying kidney disease. The urinalysis can also be used in some patients to monitor the course of kidney diseases. </p><p>Interpretation of the urinalysis in patients with established or suspected kidney disease will be presented in this topic. Assessment of kidney function, a general approach to the patient with kidney disease, an overview of the indications for kidney biopsy, and the differential diagnosis and evaluation of glomerular disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for and complications of renal biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO PERFORM A COMPLETE URINALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete urinalysis consists of three components: gross evaluation, dipstick analysis, and microscopic examination of the urine sediment. These components are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Gross assessment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4221132\" class=\"local\">'Urine dipstick'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Urine sediment'</a> below.)</p><p>A complete urinalysis should be performed in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with evidence of kidney disease, such as someone with albuminuria or an acute or chronic reduction in the glomerular filtration rate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with suspected kidney disease. Kidney disease may be suspected on the basis of clinical findings (eg, edema) or because of a concurrent illness or condition that is commonly associated with kidney disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, small-vessel vasculitis, newly identified hypertension). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with known or suspected kidney stones. A complete urinalysis may identify crystals that suggest the etiology of the stone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an otherwise asymptomatic patient in order to clarify the significance of incidental findings noted on urine dipstick analyses (eg, microscopic hematuria) when the dipstick was part of a workup for another condition (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4220647\"><span class=\"h1\">OBTAINING THE SPECIMEN FOR ANALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urine specimen must be properly collected in order to reliably interpret the findings and thus maximize diagnostic utility. The following technique should be followed whenever feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specimen should be collected into a clean dry container. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be asked to clean the external genitalia and provide a midstream specimen for analysis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with indwelling urinary catheters, a recently produced urine sample should be obtained (ie, directly from the catheter tubing), if feasible, rather than a sample from the urometer or drainage bag. This will ensure that the sample represents recently produced urine and to avoid contamination of the sample by debris in the collection bag. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specimen should be examined at room temperature within two hours of retrieval. If this is not feasible, the sample should be refrigerated at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and then re-warmed to room temperature prior to assessment. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GROSS ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal urine is clear and light yellow in color. Urine turbidity and color may be altered in a number of settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24158999\"><span class=\"h2\">Turbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Turbid urine may be seen in the setting of infection, or as a result of precipitated crystals or chyluria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24158992\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine color</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The yellow color of urine is lighter when urine is dilute and darker when concentrated, such as after an overnight water restriction. The urine may also have a variety of other colors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Red to brown urine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The excretion of red to brown urine is observed in a variety of clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The initial step in the evaluation of this abnormality is centrifugation of the urine to see whether the red color is in the urine sediment or the supernatant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55923\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55923 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the red color is seen only in the sediment (and the supernatant is not red), the patient has hematuria. (See <a href=\"#H88671922\" class=\"local\">'Detection of heme'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If, on the other hand, the supernatant is red, then the supernatant should be tested for heme with a urine dipstick: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a urine dipstick of the red supernatant is positive for heme, the patient has either hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria. (See <a href=\"#H2861842\" class=\"local\">'Hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a urine dipstick of the red supernatant is negative for heme, the patient may have one of a variety of unusual conditions. (See <a href=\"#H4221030\" class=\"local\">'Other causes of red urine'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2861842\"><span class=\"h4\">Hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria can produce a red or red to brown urine. Rarely, hemoglobinuria is associated with black urine.</p><p>Hemoglobin and myoglobin can be distinguished on a centrifuged blood sample by their effects on the color of the plasma and on the plasma haptoglobin concentration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin is relatively poorly filtered, due both to its large size (molecular weight 69,000 of the tetramer and 34,000 of the dimer) and protein binding to haptoglobin. Only the unbound dimer is filtered. Hemoglobinuria will not occur until haptoglobin is fully saturated and the filtered load of free hemoglobin exceeds proximal reabsorptive capacity. Although this does not require a high plasma concentration of the free dimer, the total hemoglobin concentration (protein-bound + tetramer + dimer) at this time generally exceeds 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> resulting in a red to brown color of the plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Haptoglobin levels typically fall due to hepatic removal of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex.<br/><br/>Hemoglobinuria is often associated with red urine. However, the combination of prolonged transit time through the nephron with glomerular bleeding and an acid urine pH may result in the formation of methemoglobin, which has a smoky brown or &quot;Coca cola&quot; color [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Glomerular versus nonglomerular bleeding'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myoglobin, by comparison, is a monomer (molecular weight 17,000) and is not protein bound. As a result, it is rapidly filtered and excreted, thereby allowing the plasma to retain its normal color unless renal failure limits myoglobin excretion. In addition, although myoglobin can bind to haptoglobin, the binding affinity is low, and thus excess plasma myoglobin does not lower the plasma haptoglobin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The source of the excess myoglobin is skeletal muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), which is also associated with a marked elevation in the serum creatine kinase concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis#H25326281\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;, section on 'Urine findings and myoglobinuria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury#H11512183\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Urinalysis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4221030\"><span class=\"h4\">Other causes of red urine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A red urine supernatant that is negative for heme can be seen in several conditions.

Increased intestinal absorption appears to be the primary abnormality in beeturia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Other urine colors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, the urine has other colors.

The black urine in ochronosis, which usually results from alkaptonuria (also called &quot;black urine disease&quot;), is caused by the urinary excretion of homogentisic acid. The black color may only be apparent after the urine stands for some time, permitting the oxidation of homogentisic acid.

Most dipsticks permit the analysis of the following core urine parameters: heme, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, albumin, hydrogen ions, specific gravity, and glucose. Dipsticks from different manufacturers vary as to the other urine parameters that are analyzed. Users should be familiar with the specific characteristics of the reagent strips they are using and adhere to manufacturer instructions regarding the amount of urine required and the time that needs to elapse before interpreting the color on any given test pad. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88671922\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of heme</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heme acts as a pseudoperoxidase, and when heme-containing urine is exposed to peroxide and a chromogen on the test pad, a color change takes place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, a positive dipstick for heme may result not only from urinary red blood cells (RBCs), but also from free hemoglobin or free myoglobin. In addition, the dipstick may be falsely positive if there is semen present in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, a positive dipstick does not establish the presence of RBCs in the urine, and the diagnosis of hematuria requires confirmation with microscopy. (See <a href=\"#H2861842\" class=\"local\">'Hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The urine dipstick is thought of as a highly sensitive test for the presence of heme in the urine, with the ability to detect minimal hematuria (eg, one to two RBCs per high-powered field) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. False-negative results are said to be unusual and, as a result, a dipstick that is negative for heme theoretically excludes hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, urinary ascorbic acid can interfere with the peroxidase reaction, thereby yielding false-negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As an example, one study showed that, in the presence of urinary ascorbic acid, the urine dipstick was negative for heme in 70 percent of patients with documented microscopic hematuria. Given the frequency of vitamin C ingestion, this may limit the value of the urine dipstick as a screening test for hematuria. Manufacturers have attempted to allay such concerns through the production of dipsticks that oxidize ascorbic acid, thereby minimizing the risk of false negatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4221400\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of leukocyte esterase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukocyte esterase released by lysed neutrophils and macrophages is a marker for the presence of white blood cells (WBCs). Excessively dilute urine may favor cell lysis and lower the threshold for test positivity. By contrast, a concentrated urine may impede cell lysis and therefore produce a false-negative result. Proteinuria and glucosuria may also lead to a false-negative test for leukocyte esterase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4221431\"><span class=\"h2\">Nitrite</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many<strong> </strong>enterobacteriaceae species, the most common microorganisms causing urinary tract infections, elaborate the enzyme nitrate reductase, which confers the ability to convert urinary nitrate to nitrite. Thus, nitrite-positive urine may indicate underlying bacteriuria. However, bacteriuria or frank infection may still be present in the absence of nitrite positivity. This would occur with organisms expressing low levels of nitrate reductase (eg, enterococcus), or when urine dwell time in the bladder is short [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urine dipstick test for protein is most sensitive to albumin and provides a semiquantitative means of assessing albuminuria. There are several important limitations of dipstick testing for the urine concentration of albumin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, moderately increased albuminuria in the range of 30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) cannot be detected with dipstick testing. This is important in some patients at high risk for kidney disease, such as those with diabetes, since therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) would be considered in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease#H220350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) and cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with severely increased albuminuria that is normally detectable by the dipstick (more than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;) may still have a negative dipstick if the urine is very dilute. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even if the urine dipstick is positive, the semiquantitative categories of albuminuria that are reported (trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+) are <strong>not</strong> necessarily reliable.

The urine pH ranges from 4.5 to 8, depending upon the systemic acid-base balance. The urine pH is most often used clinically in patients with metabolic acidosis. The appropriate renal response to acidemia is to increase urinary acid excretion, with the urine pH falling below 5.3 and usually below 5. A higher value may indicate the presence of renal tubular acidosis. A discussion of the urine pH in the diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-pathophysiology-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-and-the-effect-on-potassium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis and the effect on potassium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some settings, the urine pH is not indicative of urinary acidification. As an example, infection with any pathogen that produces urease, such as Proteus mirabilis, can result in a urine pH above 7 to 7.5, even if urinary acidification by the kidney is normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H418670915\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific gravity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The osmolality of the urine can be inferred by measuring the urine specific gravity, which is defined as the weight of the solution compared with the weight of an equal volume of distilled water. Many urine dipsticks have the capacity to provide an estimate of specific gravity. The urine specific gravity generally varies with the osmolality, rising by approximately 0.001 for every 35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> increase in urine osmolality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75070\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75070 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, a urine osmolality of 280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (which is isosmotic to normal plasma) is usually associated with a urine specific gravity of 1.008 or 1.009.</p><p>However, there is an important difference between these measures: the urine osmolality is determined by the number of particles in the urine (eg, urea, sodium, potassium), while the specific gravity is determined by both the number and size of the particles in the urine. This becomes important clinically when there are large molecules in the urine, such as glucose or radiocontrast media. In these settings, the specific gravity can reach 1.03 to 1.05 (suggesting a highly concentrated urine) despite a urine osmolality that may be dilute to plasma.</p><p>By contrast, there are no causes of a falsely low urine specific gravity. As an example, a specific gravity &le;1.003 is indicative of a maximally dilute urine (&le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H413987\"><span class=\"h3\">Urine osmolality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urine specific gravity provides an estimate of the urine osmolality, which most accurately measures the solute concentration of the urine (a function of the number of solute particles per unit volume). The plasma osmolality is maintained within a narrow range (normal is 275 to 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg),</span> principally because the kidney is able to excrete urine with an osmolality markedly different from that of plasma. This effect is mediated by antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which promotes water reabsorption in the collecting tubules, thereby raising the urine osmolality. After a water load, for example, the plasma sodium concentration and plasma osmolality fall, leading to reductions in ADH release and urine osmolality that permits an appropriate increase in water excretion. On the other hand, unreplaced water losses due, for example, to exercise-associated perspiration on a hot day result in an increase in plasma sodium and osmolality. This leads to an increase in ADH release and an increase in urine osmolality with appropriate reduction in urinary water losses.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hematuria may be grossly visible or microscopic. Microscopic hematuria is commonly defined as the presence of two or more RBCs per high-powered field in a spun urine sediment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80282\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80282 \">picture 7</a>). The urine color change in gross hematuria does not necessarily reflect a large degree of blood loss, since as little as 1 mL of blood per liter of urine can induce a visible color change. As previously mentioned, red to brown urine can be observed in patients without actual hematuria. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Red to brown urine'</a> above.)</p><p>Hematuria may be transient or persistent. Transient hematuria is relatively common in young patients and may occur following exercise or sexual intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Menstruation may confound the evaluation of hematuria, and the urinalysis should be repeated when the patient is not menstruating. However, even transient hematuria can represent underlying malignancy, especially in patients over the age of 50 years. Transient hematuria can also occur with urinary tract infection (eg, cystitis or prostatitis). This is typically accompanied by pyuria and bacteriuria, and patients may often complain of dysuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Persistent hematuria should always be evaluated. Among the more common pathologic causes are kidney stones, malignancy, and glomerular disease. A study of Israeli army recruits showed that, even in asymptomatic individuals, those with isolated persistent hematuria were 18 times more likely to develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) over a follow-up period that exceeded 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Distinguishing between glomerular and nonglomerular causes is the first key step in the evaluation of unexplained hematuria. Isomorphic RBCs have an appearance similar to erythrocytes in the circulation (small, anucleated cells shaped as biconcave discs) and can be seen with any cause of hematuria. By contrast, dysmorphic RBCs (which have an altered morphology) are suggestive of glomerular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. There are no uniform criteria for defining dysmorphic RBCs, and defining a clinically relevant proportion of dysmorphic cells is debatable; therefore, the practical utility of describing dysmorphic RBCs in the diagnosis of glomerular disease has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, RBCs that have membrane protrusions (ie, acanthocytes) are a readily definable subset of dysmorphic RBCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79440%7ENEPH%2F62064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79440 graphicRef62064 \">picture 8A-B</a>) that have a sensitivity of 52 percent and specificity of 98 percent for the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The concomitant presence of RBC casts <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> albuminuria in a patient with hematuria may also increase the likelihood that the observed hematuria is of a glomerular origin.

The initial step is the filtration of lipoprotein-bound cholesterol, particularly HDL-cholesterol. Filtration of lipoproteins is minimal in normal individuals but is markedly enhanced when glomerular permeability to macromolecules is increased in the nephrotic syndrome. Some of the filtered lipoprotein is taken up by the proximal tubular cells. The cholesterol will be seen in the urine sediment as an oval fat body when the cell is desquamated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> as free droplets or in fatty casts if the lipid is extruded from the cells.</p><p>Because of the apparent requirement for increased glomerular permeability, lipiduria is almost always diagnostic of some form of glomerular disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>).

The extent of granular or renal tubular casts may also have prognostic significance; in a study of patients with ATN who were diagnosed based upon clinical criteria, a semiquantitative assessment of the burden of granular or renal tubular epithelial cell casts on low-powered fields was associated with an increased risk of death or the subsequent need for renal replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The presence and quantity of granular casts or renal tubular epithelial cells in the urine was evaluated as a diagnostic tool in 267 patients with hospitalized AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Prior to performing a urinalysis, trained clinicians were asked to make a clinical diagnosis of ATN, prerenal AKI, or other. Since kidney biopsies were not routinely performed, the final diagnosis of ATN versus prerenal disease was determined by whether the renal function improved within 48 hours after fluid resuscitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodynamic manipulation. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pre-urinalysis diagnosis (based upon the history, physical examination, and other available data) of ATN had a positive predictive value of 86 percent. In such patients who also had at least one granular cast or tubular epithelial cell in the urinalysis, the positive predictive value increased to 100 percent. Of patients with a pre-urinalysis diagnosis of ATN and no granular casts or tubular epithelial cells, 44 percent had a final diagnosis of ATN. Thus, a diagnosis of ATN is still possible even if the urinalysis has no granular casts or tubular epithelial cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pre-urinalysis diagnosis of prerenal AKI had a positive predictive value of 77 percent.

Patients whose urinalyses revealed six or more granular casts per low-powered field (without tubular epithelial cells), six or more tubular epithelial cells per high-powered field (without granular casts), or any number of granular casts and tubular epithelial cells present in the same specimen had a significantly greater likelihood of developing worse kidney function, initiation of dialysis, or death compared with patients who had no granular casts or tubular epithelial cells (54-67 percent versus 9 percent).</p><p>A study of critically ill patients with AKI in Australia found that a higher &quot;urine microscopy score&quot; (also defined by the number of granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells, albeit using a slightly different scoring system than the previous study) was associated with more severe AKI and the receipt of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].
