They are an age-dependent phenomenon with a strong genetic predisposition. While often frightening to parents and witnesses, febrile seizures are a mostly benign occurrence and are associated with a low risk for future epilepsy. Approximately one-third of children will have recurrent febrile seizures during early childhood, and the risk is increased in association with certain clinical features, including young age, low fever, family history of febrile seizures, and abnormal development at the time of first seizure.</p><p>Febrile seizures are described as being simple or complex. Simple febrile seizures are the most common type and are characterized by a single generalized seizure lasting less than 10 to 15 minutes. Complex febrile seizures include those that are focal, prolonged, or recurrent within a 24-hour period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of febrile seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While simple febrile seizures have typically spontaneously resolved by the time the child is evaluated and do not need to be treated, prolonged seizures may require abortive treatment with benzodiazepines in the ambulance or in the emergency department. Prophylactic antiseizure drugs can decrease the risk of recurrent febrile seizures, but given the benign nature of most seizures, the risks of side effects generally outweigh the benefits.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment and prognosis of febrile seizures, including febrile status epilepticus. Management of afebrile seizures and epilepsy in infants and children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in children: Initial treatment and monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H762182288\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of children with seizure in the setting of fever must distinguish febrile seizure from alternative and more serious etiologies such as central nervous system infection. This can be accomplished with a thorough history and physical examination in most cases, along with neuroimaging and lumbar puncture in selected circumstances. Children with focal or prolonged febrile seizures may require more extensive evaluation than those with simple febrile seizures, particularly at the time of the first seizure. Therapies discussed below assume that such etiologies have been ruled out and that the diagnosis of febrile seizure has been established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of febrile seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H762181597\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H762182888\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency rescue therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of febrile seizures have ended spontaneously by the time the child is first evaluated, and the child is rapidly returning to a normal baseline. In such cases, active treatment with benzodiazepines is not necessary. Fever should be treated symptomatically.</p><p>As with afebrile seizures, febrile seizures that continue for more than five minutes should be treated. Intravenous benzodiazepines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> 0.1 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lorazepam</a> 0.05 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> are effective in aborting seizure in many cases. If the seizure persists, an additional dose may be given. The child's respiratory and circulatory status should be monitored carefully and an advanced airway intervention (eg, bag-mask ventilation, laryngeal mask airway, definitive artificial airway) undertaken if the ventilatory status becomes inadequate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy and safety of intravenous benzodiazepines as first-line agents for the treatment of seizures in children has been demonstrated in several randomized trials, primarily in children with afebrile seizures or status epilepticus. A 2018 meta-analysis concluded that intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lorazepam</a> was as effective as intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> and that both were associated with similar rates of respiratory depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a randomized trial of 273 children with status epilepticus, intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam had similar efficacy, but lorazepam-treated children were more likely to be sedated (67 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Rates of intubation were similar (16 to 17 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children#H18020306\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of convulsive status epilepticus in children&quot;, section on 'Initial pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>When intravenous access is unavailable or cannot be achieved, buccal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> is an effective alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; a typical dose is 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> maximum dose 10 mg. Intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lorazepam</a> is also an option. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 trials including 2199 children concluded that buccal or intranasal antiseizure drugs were as effective as intravenous antiseizure drugs in treating status epilepticus, but there was only low-quality evidence comparing buccal midazolam with rectal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Respiratory complications requiring assisted ventilation are similar, regardless of administration route.

The most commonly used drug in this setting is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fosphenytoin</a> (20 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> equivalents <span class=\"nowrap\">[PE]/kg</span> intravenously). Efforts should be made to lower fever with antipyretics and a cooling blanket. The management of status epilepticus in children is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of convulsive status epilepticus in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management&quot;, section on 'Management of fever'</a>.)</p><p>Febrile status epilepticus rarely stops spontaneously and often requires more than one medication to control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It is more common in young children and is focal in two-thirds of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. In a prospective cohort study of 119 children presenting with prolonged febrile seizures (&gt;30 minutes), 70 percent of children required more than one antiseizure drug, and delays in antiseizure drug administration were associated with longer seizure duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Important clinical clues that a seizure has ended include the presence of closed eyes and a deep breath. Children with persistently open and deviated eyes may still be seizing, even if convulsive motor activity has stopped.

The ability of emergency medical services (EMS) to administer antiseizure drugs varies by region, however.

In a larger prospective study, earlier onset of treatment was associated with shorter total seizure duration of febrile status epilepticus and better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Similarly in the United Kingdom, an epidemiological study strongly supported prehospital treatment with buccal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> as a widely used but unlicensed option in the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H762183879\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCHARGE DISPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with simple febrile seizures do not require hospital admission and can be discharged safely to home once they have returned to a normal baseline and parents have been educated about the risk of recurrent febrile seizures. (See <a href=\"#H762183546\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent febrile seizures'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with focal or prolonged seizures may require a more extended period of observation, particularly if there is delayed recovery to baseline or postictal focality. In addition, they are at higher risk of having multiple seizures within the index illness. In a retrospective study of 228 presenting to an emergency department with febrile seizure, the cumulative probability of early recurrence was 9 percent within 6 hours, 13 percent within 12 hours, and 16 percent within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ninety percent of recurrences occurred within the first 24 hours. Risk factors for early recurrence were focal seizure and prolonged seizure (&gt;15 minutes).</p><p>Additional factors to consider when deciding whether to admit a child include the confidence with which outpatient follow-up can be arranged (for focal or prolonged seizures), comfort level of the parents, and severity of the underlying febrile illness (eg, hydration status, ability to take oral fluids).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H762183546\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT FEBRILE SEIZURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with febrile seizures are at risk for developing recurrent febrile seizures with future illnesses during early childhood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864056578\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall recurrence rate is approximately 30 to 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, the values vary with age, from as high as 50 to 65 percent in children who are younger than one year of age at the time of the first seizure, to as low as 20 percent in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A major factor influencing the recurrence rate is the age of the infant at the time of the first seizure.</p><p>A prospective cohort study of 428 children with a first febrile seizure defined other features and factors influencing recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Approximately one-third of the children had at least one recurrence, 17 percent had one recurrence, 9 percent had two recurrences, and approximately 6 percent had three or more recurrences. The majority of recurrences (50 to 75 percent) took place within one year of the initial seizure, and almost all occurred within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

These findings were confirmed in another prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Other factors identified in different studies have been abnormal development before the first febrile seizure, a history of afebrile seizures in parents and siblings, recurrence of seizures within the same illness, and the number of subsequent febrile illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/10,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-15</a>].

Another risk factor is an unprovoked seizure after a febrile seizure; such children are at substantial risk for further seizures with fever (rate ratio 3.47 after adjusting for the above risk factors, p = 0.0015) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864054995\"><span class=\"h2\">Provision of home benzodiazepines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with a history of prolonged febrile seizure, including febrile status epilepticus (FSE), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> rectal gel (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> can be administered by parents at home if the episode lasts longer than five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

A comparison of midazolam nasal spray and rectal diazepam solution for residential treatment of seizure exacerbations found that midazolam was equal in efficacy to diazepam, and drowsiness occurred in more than 50 percent of administrations for both drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In children with recurrent febrile seizures, those with long duration (defined as lasting longer than 10 minutes) tend to have similar features in repeat episodes. Similarly, children who have multiple risk factors for recurrent febrile seizures (focal onset, multiple seizures during the episode) and have a prolonged febrile seizure often have prolonged recurrent febrile seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In some children, a febrile seizure may represent the first presentation of epilepsy.

However, careful clinical history and review of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in cases of complex febrile seizures or febrile status epilepticus may reveal characteristics of an underlying epilepsy syndrome or risk factors for later development of temporal lobe epilepsy, such as acute focal slowing on EEG or subsequent mesial temporal sclerosis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

Heat production is not inhibited by antipyretics, but heat dissipation is augmented by increased peripheral blood flow and sweating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> and barbiturates cause a fall in body temperature by depression of the central temperature regulatory mechanism. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Phenobarbital</a> inhibits heat production during the pyrogenic stage of the fever, whereas acetaminophen facilitates heat loss at the height of the fever or during its defervescence. The mechanism whereby phenobarbital reduces febrile seizure recurrence may be related to both an antipyretic and anticonvulsant effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The role of antipyretics in the management of fever in children is discussed separately.

While early reports had suggested that febrile seizures were associated with an increased risk of sudden death, the results from a large population-based study indicate that the small excess in mortality among children with febrile seizures is restricted to those with complex febrile seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Furthermore, the increased risk in those patients is explained, at least in part, by preexisting neurologic abnormalities and subsequent epilepsy. In six cases of sudden unexplained death in toddlers with febrile seizures, hippocampal abnormalities were identified in one of three with available autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Inheritance was autosomal dominant.

In a case-control study in which 159 children with febrile seizures were compared with 142 controls, performance on measures of cognition, motor ability, and adaptive behavior were similar at one month after a first febrile seizure and one year later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Most reports documenting neurologic complications have been anecdotal and derived from biased populations consisting of children assessed in hospitals or clinics; in some cases, they may reflect preexisting abnormalities. When new deficits were reported, they occurred only after complex or prolonged febrile seizures. In a small study, face recognition memory was impaired after prolonged febrile seizures, and the deficit was linked to the size of the hippocampi when tested one year later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In general, population-based studies do not corroborate anecdotal reports of neurologic complications. In the National Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP), approximately 5 percent of children had febrile seizures lasting longer than 30 minutes. None of these children sustained permanent motor deficits and none had impaired mental development unless they developed afebrile seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The children were assessed when they were 10 years old, and children who had neurologic and developmental problems prior to the first febrile seizure were excluded. No difference was found in measurements of academic progress in children with febrile seizures, whether simple, complex, or recurrent, compared with a controlled cohort. There was also no difference in behavior between the two groups. Finally, among 18,000 Danish conscripts aged 18 to 20 years old, there was no association found between febrile seizures and cognitive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H750680594\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epilepsy occurs more frequently in children who have had febrile seizures than in the general population.

Three risk factors for developing epilepsy were identified: focal seizures, prolonged seizures, and repeated episodes within 24 hours during the same illness.

Significant prognostic markers for subsequent epilepsy included a family history of epilepsy (especially maternal), complex febrile seizure, focal febrile seizure, Todd's paresis, short fever duration before the seizure, late onset of febrile seizure (&gt;3 years old), and multiple febrile seizure recurrences. Multiple febrile seizures increased the risk of epilepsy 10 times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H750680600\"><span class=\"h3\">Electroencephalogram and risk of epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While electroencephalogram (EEG) is not useful in determining the risk of recurrent febrile seizures, it is often performed in the outpatient setting to identify children at increased risk for future epilepsy, in combination with other risk factors.</p><p>The evidence to support the utility of EEG in this setting is mixed, however. In one small study, 25 percent of children (9 of 36) with epileptiform discharges on EEG after febrile seizure developed epilepsy, compared with 2 percent of controls with a normal EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The rate of recurrent febrile seizures was similar (33 and 26 percent, respectively).

Epileptiform EEGs were noted in 20 percent of those who developed epilepsy and 13 percent of those who did not, resulting in a positive predictive value of only 15 percent.</p><p>If the decision is made to obtain an EEG, the optimal timing is also uncertain. Abnormalities are more likely to be found when the test is performed shortly after the seizure and when convulsions are of long duration and have focal features. Transient slow wave abnormality up to 10 days after recovery from a febrile seizure is reported in 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Multiple seizures within 24 hours are predictive of abnormal EEG, and abnormalities are more common in children with complex than simple febrile seizures (43 versus 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Some studies suggest that certain abnormal EEG findings may be more strongly associated with the risk of epilepsy than others, but the EEG alone should not be used as a basis for treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Focal EEG slowing or attenuation on an EEG obtained within 72 hours of febrile status epilepticus is a potential biomarker for later development of epilepsy, and such changes are highly associated with MRI evidence of acute hippocampal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Reports of patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy considered for surgery often find an association with febrile convulsions in infancy, particularly prolonged seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition, studies assessing hippocampal volume in adults with epilepsy have found an association between a smaller hippocampus and a history of febrile seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Data are conflicting as to whether a correlation exists between the duration of epilepsy and a reduction in hippocampal volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Hippocampal abnormalities have also been associated with familial febrile seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The possibility of hippocampal injury induced by febrile seizures was assessed by MRI in infants who had had complex febrile seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Abnormalities were found in the children with focal and prolonged complex febrile seizures but not in those with generalized febrile seizures. In a few children who had significantly longer seizures, MRI suggested acute edema of the hippocampus, a finding noted in other case series as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Follow-up imaging studies in these children may show hippocampal atrophy or abnormal apparent diffusion coefficient measurements. Another study found that hippocampal atrophy and other MRI characteristics of hippocampal sclerosis were more common in adults with a history of febrile seizures in childhood than those without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Although these observations suggest acute injury to the hippocampus during a febrile seizure, the possibility of preexisting lesions leading to susceptibility to injury is not excluded.</p><p>Studies based mainly upon imaging results and patients being considered for epilepsy surgery suggest an association between febrile seizures and temporal lobe epilepsy. Some clinical studies reached a similar conclusion. In one, patients presenting to an epilepsy clinic because of a previous diagnosis of epilepsy or recent onset of seizures were prospectively questioned about febrile seizures and their characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Febrile seizures were reported by 13.2 percent of the patients. Temporal lobe epilepsy was more likely to be preceded by febrile convulsions than by other types of epilepsy (25.2 versus 5.6 percent, respectively). Prolonged duration was the most common feature of the complex febrile seizure associated with temporal lobe epilepsy, although patients with generalized epilepsy were more likely to have had simple febrile seizures.</p><p>However, carefully performed community-based epidemiologic studies have not been able to confirm this association. In one, the characteristics of epilepsy were evaluated in 524 children who were one year of age or older at the onset of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Febrile seizures were present in 14 percent of the patients. Complex febrile seizures were associated with a younger age at onset of the epilepsy, but there was no specific association with localization-related forms of epilepsy. No evidence that focal or prolonged febrile seizures were associated with temporal lobe epilepsy was found; three children had hippocampal atrophy demonstrated on their initial MRI, but none had a history of febrile seizures.</p><p>In summary, febrile seizures do not appear to cause temporal lobe epilepsy.

Children with febrile status epilepticus are more likely to have hippocampal imaging abnormalities at the time of presentation compared with those with simple febrile seizures, including abnormal hippocampal T2 hyperintensity in 11.5 percent and developmental abnormalities of the hippocampus in 10.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/4,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,28</a>].

Compared with children with a first simple febrile seizure, children with FSE are also at an increased risk for subsequent FSE, particularly those with a baseline MRI abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Another study followed 44 children with FSE, most of whom were identified prospectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. After a mean follow-up of 28 months, the risk of recurrent seizures (febrile and afebrile) was increased only in those who had prior neurologic abnormalities.
