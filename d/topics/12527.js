Adequate patient tolerance is essential for the successful completion of a safe examination and compliance with subsequent follow-up. As a result, endoscopists have developed skills in administering a variety of sedative and analgesic agents to facilitate procedures and enhance patient comfort.</p><p>This topic review will focus on standard methods of procedural sedation.

Other physical features that could make positive pressure ventilation or intubation difficult include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A short, thick neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical spine disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural abnormalities of the mouth, jaw, or oral cavity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decreased thyromental distance</p><p/><p>No data have been published showing that determining the Mallampati classification prior to endoscopy leads to reduced cardiopulmonary adverse events. Despite this fact, we feel it is advisable to identify in advance those patients who would be at increased risk for difficult airway management should they cross into deeper levels of sedation in which airway reflexes might be lost, requiring intervention. Such information can affect the setting in which the endoscopy is performed (hospital versus outpatient center), which sedatives are chosen, and whether to employ the help of an anesthesiologist or a certified registered nurse anesthetist. A detailed pre-procedure airway assessment is particularly pertinent to cases planned to be performed using propofol-based deep sedation. &#160;</p><p>Once the history and physical examination are complete, patients should be classified using the American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status classification to quantify their overall comorbid disease risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 1</a>). The ASA score should be documented in the endoscopy report.

If any doubt exists, a pregnancy test should be obtained prior to administering sedation. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy and lactation'</a> below.)</p><p>Recommendations differ with regard to pre-procedure fasting for elective procedures. The ASA guidelines state that patients should fast a minimum of two hours following clear liquid ingestion, and six hours for a light meal prior to a procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contrast, the American College of Emergency Physicians states &quot;recent food intake is not a contraindication for administering procedural sedation and analgesia, but should be considered in choosing the timing and target level of sedation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Our practice is to follow the ASA approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LEVELS OF SEDATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The levels of sedation are defined as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal sedation (anxiolysis) refers to a drug-induced state during which patients respond normally to verbal commands. Cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, but ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate sedation (conscious sedation) refers to drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep sedation refers to drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily aroused, but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. Patients may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General anesthesia refers to a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function is often impaired. Such patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infrequent, but potentially severe, cardiorespiratory adverse events of procedural sedation require careful patient monitoring. This includes monitoring of blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and, in patients with cardiovascular disease, electrocardiography. Monitoring also requires observation of the patient throughout the procedure to watch for reduced ventilatory effort, apnea, and secretions, which might result in aspiration.</p><p>Endoscopy training should include instruction on proper administration of sedation and appropriate patient monitoring. Full oxygen tanks, oral suction devices, oral airways, ventilatory devices (eg, Ambu bag), and reversal agents must be readily available in the endoscopy unit, and resuscitation equipment must be easily accessible. Endoscopy personnel must be adequately trained to resuscitate patients receiving procedural sedation. Finally, equipment must be regularly inspected and staff kept fully updated in their ability to use it.</p><p>Patient monitoring during sedation is accomplished by a combination of visual assessment and monitoring devices. Sedation is graded along a continuum, from minimal sedation to general anesthesia. Moderate sedation is appropriate for most endoscopic procedures. However, it is not always possible to predict how a patient will respond to sedation, and some patients move past moderate sedation into deep sedation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Levels of sedation'</a> above.)</p><p>Methods for patient monitoring include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic monitoring &ndash; Heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored in all patients receiving intravenous sedation. The heart rate should be monitored continuously, and the blood pressure should be checked at baseline and then at three to five minute intervals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiography &ndash; The American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) guidelines recommend continuous electrocardiography for patients with significant cardiovascular disease or dysrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Electrocardiography is not required for low-risk patients undergoing minimal or moderate sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Low-risk patients include those who are ASA class 1 or class 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse oximetry &ndash; Continuous pulse oximetry is recommended for all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, it is relatively insensitive for detecting early hypoventilation and is not a replacement for direct observation of the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Capnography &ndash; Capnography (carbon dioxide monitoring in exhaled breath) is a noninvasive technique that is more sensitive than direct visual observation or pulse oximetry for detecting hypoventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. The ASA recommends that capnography be monitored for all patients receiving moderate and deep sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends that it be considered for patients receiving deep sedation, but it states that there are insufficient data to mandate its use in all patients undergoing endoscopy with moderate sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. Many of the data demonstrating a benefit to the use of capnography monitoring in endoscopy relate to deep sedation using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> for complex procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound. Studies in patients receiving an opioid and benzodiazepine for routine upper endoscopy or colonoscopy have not shown a benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p>Capnography is typically obtained using a separate sample cannula that connects to the nasal cannula. Alternatively, this cannula can be connected to or taped within a face mask. An infrared measuring cell analyzes the carbon dioxide content of inspired and expired gases. The data are displayed as a capnographic waveform (or capnogram). In a normal waveform, there is a peak during expiration and a trough during inspiration. By analyzing the waveform, patterns of respiration can be identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transcutaneous capnometry to measure carbon dioxide has also been used. Capnometry differs from capnography in that, while it provides a measurement of carbon dioxide, it does not display the measurement as a waveform. A controlled trial evaluating this approach in 195 patients undergoing ERCP found that hypercapnia was not reliably detected in patients receiving supplemental oxygen by clinical observation or pulse oximetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The addition of transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring prevented severe carbon dioxide retention more effectively than intensive clinical monitoring and pulse oximetry alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal oxygen supplementation readily reverses or prevents oxygen desaturation during endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] and is recommended for patients receiving sedation by both the American Society for Anesthesiology and the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/2,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17-19</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of nasal oxygen was demonstrated in a randomized trial in which 289 patients were assigned to receive either oxygen via a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> or no oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A reduction in the proportion of patients with oxygen desaturations was observed in the group assigned to supplemental oxygen compared with those who did not receive supplemental oxygen for upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (0 versus 28 percent, 6 versus 37 percent, and 0 versus 50 percent, respectively).</p><p>Prevention of oxygen desaturation may be particularly important in patients with a history of coronary heart disease. In such patients, supplemental oxygen can significantly reduce the rate of ST-segment changes (both ST-segment elevations and depressions) on electrocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

This section will focus on the medications currently in widespread use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65736\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65736 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a majority of patients, intravenous administration of benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with opiates, is adequate to achieve a moderate level of sedation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65736\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65736 \">table 2</a>). A systematic review of 36 studies involving procedural sedation found a high level of clinician and patient satisfaction at moderate sedation levels, with a low risk of serious adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Levels of sedation'</a> above.) </p><p>Several other approaches to procedural sedation are under investigation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> and patient-controlled sedation and analgesia), but are not routinely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternatives-and-adjuncts-to-moderate-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternatives and adjuncts to moderate procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Choosing the correct medications and doses depends upon an assessment of the individual patient and the degree of sedation required to adequately complete the intended procedure. Because the level of sedation required varies with patient characteristics and the procedure, it is important for the endoscopist to keep both of these considerations in mind when selecting the pre-procedure sedation plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient-related considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a number of clinical trials, the following patient characteristics were associated with tolerance of upper endoscopy or colonoscopy with little or no sedation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedation-free-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedation-free gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of an abdominal pain history</p><p/><p>The factors that predict poor procedural tolerance are less well studied. Factors that have been identified include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of prior difficulty with procedural sedation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benzodiazepine or opioid use (prescribed or illicit)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy alcohol use</p><p/><p>Up to 30 percent of patients with these risk factors will have difficulty achieving adequate sedation. Another problem is that some patients develop paradoxical agitation in response to benzodiazepines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternatives-and-adjuncts-to-moderate-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternatives and adjuncts to moderate procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Comorbid illnesses and current medications should be considered when deciding upon the sedation regimen. It is especially important to identify potential drug interactions or conditions that may affect drug metabolism or excretion. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Meperidine</a>, for example, interacts with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. In addition, because it has active metabolites, meperidine may cause problems in patients with advanced liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure-related considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second major factor that determines the type of procedural sedation used is the degree of difficulty and the level of sedation required for a particular procedure. There are data suggesting that elective upper endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and, in some cases, colonoscopy require little or no sedation for the typical patient. However, in the United States, most gastroenterologists give some intravenous procedural sedation for all procedures except flexible sigmoidoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedation-free-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedation-free gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Emergency therapeutic procedures and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are frequently longer procedures and may require deeper levels of sedation. This is particularly important with maneuvers such as sphincterotomy or application of electrocautery to a visible vessel, where small patient position changes may have significant adverse effects. Thus, patients undergoing these procedures may require deeper sedation and consultation with an anesthesiologist should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pre-procedure preparation and assessment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharyngeal anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharyngeal anesthesia is typically used to suppress the gag reflex during procedures involving the upper gastrointestinal tract. Commonly used local anesthetics for topical anesthesia include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracaine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, which are administered by aerosol spray or gargling. The effects last for up to one hour.</p><p>The efficacy of pharyngeal anesthesia was best evaluated in a meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials, with a total of 491 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The patients who received pharyngeal anesthesia were significantly more likely to report &quot;no&quot; or &quot;minimal discomfort&quot; (odds ratio [OR] 1.9), and endoscopists were significantly more likely in such patients to rate the procedure as &quot;not difficult&quot; (OR 2.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Pharyngeal anesthesia may be particularly helpful in patients who elect to receive little or no intravenous sedation and in those who report gagging easily. On the other hand, pharyngeal anesthesia can likely be omitted for most patients receiving the doses of intravenous sedation typically used in the United States.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Benzocaine</a> has been associated with methemoglobinemia and should be <strong>avoided</strong> in patients with a previous history of methemoglobinemia or known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse events related to procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines and opiates are usually used in combination to take advantage of their synergistic effects, especially for longer procedures. However, such combinations may increase the risk of airway obstruction and respiratory depression, leading to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. In addition, these agents should be used with caution in older adults and in patients with significant liver or kidney disease, as they may be more sensitive to their sedative and cardiopulmonary effects.</p><p>If benzodiazepines and opiates are used in combination and additional doses are required during the procedure, it is important to give only one drug at a time for subsequent boluses, waiting a few minutes following each dose to observe the effect before considering additional medication. In particular, care must be taken in older adults because a prolonged circulation time may delay their response to medication administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Benzodiazepines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines are used for their sedative, amnestic, and anxiolytic properties. The most commonly used benzodiazepine is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65736\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65736 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>With respect to potency, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> was 3.4 times more potent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The difference in potency begins to increase in patients over age 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. In patients over age 70, the midazolam dose necessary for appropriate sedation is often so low that overdosing can easily occur and may account for some cardiopulmonary deaths that have been reported in older adult patients who received intravenous midazolam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. On the other hand, the longer half-life of diazepam may be a concern in cognitively impaired or older adult patients.</p><p>The usual initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> is 1 to 2 mg in younger healthy patients, given along with an opioid. If the initial dose does not produce adequate sedation, additional 0.5 to 1 mg boluses can be given every two to three minutes. For older adults and patients with significant liver or renal disease, we suggest reducing both the initial bolus dose of midazolam and the subsequent doses (0.5 to 1 mg initial bolus and 0.25 to 0.5 mg subsequent doses). In these patients it may also be reasonable to use a benzodiazepine as a single agent, omitting the opioid from the regimen.</p><p>When necessary, the effects of benzodiazepines can be temporarily reversed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse events related to procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;, section on 'Oversedation and adverse events related to reversal agents'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Opiates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opiates have both sedative and analgesic properties. The two most commonly used are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65736\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65736 \">table 2</a>). Opiates must be given cautiously in patients taking other central nervous system depressants such as other opiates, sedatives, tranquilizers, phenothiazines, or antihistamines. As with benzodiazepines, the opioid dose should be reduced in older adults and patients with significant liver or kidney disease. In addition, opiates should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures since opiates lower the seizure threshold.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fentanyl</a> is favored by anesthesiologists because of its rapid onset of action and clearance. A randomized controlled trial comparing fentanyl with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> in 111 adults undergoing upper endoscopy or colonoscopy found significantly shorter procedure times with fentanyl, mainly related to reduced recovery time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Meperidine</a> should be avoided in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to drug interactions. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Morphine</a> is another option, but is often avoided due to its slow onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65736\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65736 \">table 2</a>) and because of concern about stimulating smooth muscle contraction and inducing spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, which may be a particular problem during ERCP.</p><p>Opiates can be temporarily reversed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, though its use can induce acute opioid withdrawal in patients with a history of chronic opioid use. In addition, it may cause a significant increase in sympathetic activity, leading to hypertension and pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse events related to procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;, section on 'Oversedation and adverse events related to reversal agents'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Propofol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a> acts by increasing gamma aminobutyric acid activity in the brain. Its benefits include rapid onset of action and rapid clearance. It has some antiemetic effect and has a weaker amnestic effect than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, but no analgesic effect. The major drawback of propofol is that it has a narrow therapeutic index and thus may result in overdose and consequent cardiorespiratory depression including airway obstruction and respiratory depression, as well as significant hypotension.</p><p>The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> for routine endoscopic procedures is controversial and discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternatives-and-adjuncts-to-moderate-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternatives and adjuncts to moderate procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AND LACTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety and efficacy of endoscopic procedures during pregnancy have not been extensively studied. Our approach is generally to follow the recommendations from a 2012 guideline issued by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Its major conclusions with regard to procedural sedation are summarized here:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy during pregnancy should only be performed if there is a strong indication, and, when possible, it should be postponed until the second trimester.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close involvement of the obstetrical staff is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of maternal and fetal monitoring needs to be individualized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For procedural sedation during pregnancy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> (category C) alone is preferred, followed by small doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (category D) as needed. If deep sedation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> (category B) is needed, it should be administered by an anesthesia provider. Of note, while the 2012 ASGE guideline suggests using meperidine in women who are pregnant, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (category C) is used more commonly than meperidine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For procedural sedation in women who are breastfeeding:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fentanyl</a> is preferred to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> because the concentrations of fentanyl in breast milk are too low to be pharmacologically significant, as opposed to meperidine, which is concentrated in breast milk. Breastfeeding may be continued without interruption after maternal fentanyl administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants should <strong>not</strong> be breastfed for at least four hours after maternal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> administration. After four hours, breast milk should be pumped and discarded before reinitiating breastfeeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Breast feeding may be continued in women who have received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> because the amount of the drug excreted in breast milk is small (0.015 percent of the maternal dose). This represents a change from the prior recommendation (previously it was recommended that infants not be breastfed for four hours). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy is generally well tolerated, but adverse events can occur. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse events related to procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-PROCEDURE MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients remain at risk for cardiopulmonary adverse events of sedation after the procedure is completed. At this time, the absence of stimulation related to the procedure and the presence of active drug and metabolites in the circulation create an increased risk of respiratory depression. As a result, vital signs, respiratory effort, and level of consciousness need to be monitored at regular intervals.</p><p>In addition, many immediate adverse events of endoscopy become evident during the recovery period as the analgesics wear off and the level of consciousness improves. Particular attention is required in individuals who have received reversal agents for respiratory depression or other signs of resedation, since the duration of action of the reversal agents may be shorter than that of the sedatives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65736\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65736 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse events related to procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;, section on 'Oversedation and adverse events related to reversal agents'</a>.)</p><p>Scoring systems have been developed to guide the timing of patient discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Outpatients should be discharged with an adult to accompany them home and strongly advised not to drive a car or operate machinery for at least six hours. Important instructions should be written down since the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines may not have dissipated when verbal instructions are given.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pre-procedure preparation and assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that an anesthesiologist be consulted for patients who are at increased risk of adverse events related to sedation, who are likely to be difficult to sedate, who are considered high-risk for aspiration, who are undergoing complex endoscopic procedures in which deep sedation is desired, or who have comorbidities that place them at higher risk for cardiorespiratory adverse events. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pre-procedure preparation and assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women of childbearing age should be asked if they could be pregnant. If any doubt exists, a pregnancy test should be obtained prior to administering sedation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a majority of patients, adequate sedation can be achieved with the combination of an intravenous benzodiazepine and an opioid. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Sedatives and analgesics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The doses of sedatives administered may need to be decreased in older adults and in patients with significant liver or kidney disease.

This includes monitoring of blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and electrocardiography (in patients with cardiovascular disease). Capnography should be used in patients undergoing deep sedation or those undergoing longer and more complex procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Monitoring also includes observation of the patient throughout the procedure to watch for reduced ventilatory effort or increased secretions that might result in aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients require continued monitoring following their procedures.
