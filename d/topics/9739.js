However, application of the latter requirement to cytologic specimens and small biopsies, as opposed to resected tumors, is problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. LCNECs do not meet the criteria for the three better recognized neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, and small cell carcinoma). Previously classified as a variant of large cell carcinoma, LCNEC is grouped with the pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas in the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H4047701511\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10116457\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation and natural history of LCNEC appear similar to the other high-grade neuroendocrine pulmonary tumor, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), with two exceptions: primary LCNECs tend to be located peripherally rather than centrally and presentation of LCNECs with early stage (I-II) disease is more common than for SCLC (approximately 25 percent versus less than 5 percent). Thus, patients with LCNEC more commonly undergo resection. Further, because LCNEC can be a difficult diagnosis based on needle aspirate or small biopsy, the diagnosis is frequently made post-resection. </p><p>Most studies indicate that survival is worse for LCNEC compared to non-small cell carcinoma and other large cell carcinomas, and similar to that of SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In a surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER) database study of 1444 early stage patients who underwent resection only (no radiation therapy and no information regarding chemotherapy), a numerically worse four-year survival rate was observed in patients with SCLC, compared to LCNEC and other large cell carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However multivariate analysis demonstrated no significant difference in overall or lung cancer-specific survival between LCNEC and SCLC, nor between LCNEC and other large cell carcinomas. These data should not alter the general impression that LCNEC carries a relatively poor prognosis given the limitations of this analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risk factors, pathology, and clinical manifestations of lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2861305951\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR PROFILING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molecular profiling of LCNEC suggests similarities between both small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).</p><p>For example, targeted next-generation sequencing (241 genes) of 45 LCNEC resected tumors has demonstrated two major genomic signatures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Eighteen (40 percent) tumors possessed coalterations of <em>TP53</em> and <em>RB1</em> (18 of 43, 42 percent) and other alterations commonly found in SCLC, such as <em>MYCL</em> amplification, and were termed SCLC-like. Twenty-five (55 percent) tumors were devoid of coaltered <em><span class=\"nowrap\">TP53/RB1</em>,</span> and instead possessed mutations commonly seen in NSCLC including <em>KRAS</em>, <em>STK11</em>, and <em>KEAP1</em>, and differentiation marker expression seen in adenocarcinoma. However, this latter group, termed NSCLC-like, also had frequent mutations in <em>NOTCH1-4</em>, similar to SCLC. Although the number of cases is small, and confirmation of these findings in a larger dataset and prospective clinical trials are needed, molecular profiling of LCNEC may ultimately guide treatment choices in LCNEC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3629252091\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the rarity of LCNEC, there are no clinical trials that define the optimal treatment approach for either localized or advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Treatment recommendations are based upon extrapolation from the approach to patients with non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer and the established literature, which is primarily retrospective in nature. </p><p>Data from a prospective phase II trial of 29 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a></span> along with review of published retrospective experience with chemotherapy in stage IV LCNEC demonstrated that major efficacy endpoints were similar to small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), with the exception that overall response rate is lower (34 percent) than the approximate 60 percent rate observed in SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Because of the worse prognosis compared with other forms of non-small cell lung cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy may offer the best chance to improve survival. Data supporting this are summarized in a comprehensive review and small prospective studies.
