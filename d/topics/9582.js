JDM is primarily a capillary vasculopathy, whereas JPM involves direct T cell invasion of muscle fibers similar to that seen in adult polymyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. However, as the diagnostic tools become more sophisticated (eg, biopsies that demonstrate inclusion body myositis or inflammatory dystrophies, or autoantibodies that are markers of particular types of myositis such as anti-signal recognition particle [SRP] and necrotizing myopathy), fewer patients are diagnosed with JPM, calling into question whether JPM is a specific entity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment, complications, natural history, and prognosis of JDM and JPM are reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of these disorders are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603846500\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data from randomized, controlled trials to guide management decisions in the children with JDM or JPM. Until better data exist, we use the approach discussed below, based upon observational studies and our clinical experience. The goals of treatment include control of the underlying inflammatory myositis and prevention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of complications (eg, contractures and calcinosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7897827\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intensity of initial therapy increases with increasing severity of the symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], which range from mild disease with muscle weakness and cutaneous manifestations to serious, life-threatening weakness, internal organ damage, and ulcerative skin lesions. In a 2008 survey of North American pediatric rheumatologists, the majority of respondents used a combination of glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> to treat children with JDM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the dose, route of administration, and the use of adjunctive therapy (eg, intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>) varied. The Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) has proposed several treatment strategies for initial therapy for JDM based upon a North American survey of practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Our approach is consistent with the CARRA treatment strategies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7898632\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild to moderate disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment used for the majority of children with JDM or JPM is a combination of high-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, maximum 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> in divided doses given twice daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> maximum 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dose</span> once weekly, administered as a subcutaneous injection). Children who receive methotrexate should also be given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> at 1 mg per day to limit methotrexate toxicity.</p><p>We use intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (IVMP) in place of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for patients in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with ulcerative disease or a poor response or worsening of their disease on oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with respiratory compromise who are unable to take oral medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with gastrointestinal complications that may limit absorption of orally administered medications</p><p/><p>The skin findings of <span class=\"nowrap\">amyopathic/hypomyopathic</span> JDM remit without systemic therapy in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. However, we feel that children with <span class=\"nowrap\">amyopathic/hypomyopathic</span> JDM with muscle enzyme elevation or other evidence of subclinical muscle inflammation should be treated, regardless of whether or not clinically evident weakness is present, in order to prevent long-term complications such as calcinosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7899188\"><span class=\"h4\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are the initial agents of choice in treating patients with JDM or JPM. The two most commonly used regimens are daily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and intravenous pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (IVMP). Either is usually used in combination with a steroid-sparing agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. (See <a href=\"#H7899888\" class=\"local\">'Steroid-sparing agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Early evidence demonstrating the efficacy of systemic glucocorticoids was based upon a retrospective review of 47 children with JDM treated at a single center between 1964 and 1982 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients who received high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) within four months of the onset of their symptoms had better functional outcome and less calcinosis compared with those who received smaller doses of prednisone or who were treated later in the course of their disease. The mortality rate of children with JDM has dramatically decreased (from over 30 to less than 2 percent) with the routine use of glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7899274\"><span class=\"h5\">Oral prednisone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Daily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> has been the mainstay of treatment of JDM and JPM for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In responsive patients, muscle weakness and rash improve and serum muscle enzymes return to normal levels over six to eight weeks of therapy. Most North American pediatric rheumatologists, including the authors, use a high-dose corticosteroid regimen to initially treat JDM and JPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Our standard initial regimen is prednisone at 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> in divided doses given twice daily for six weeks, after which it is consolidated into one daily dose (see <a href=\"#H7898038\" class=\"local\">'Tapering therapy in responsive patients'</a> below). Others adjust the dose relative to the disease severity, using lower doses in children with milder disease in order to decrease the total cumulative dose and reduce the adverse effects of glucocorticoids. However, outcomes are better with high-dose glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p>In the previously mentioned observational study, patients who received smaller doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> generally had a poorer outcome than those who received a high prednisone dose (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In another study, low-dose prednisone therapy (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) was administered to 36 children with JDM. At a mean follow-up of 4.9 years, 28 had no functional impairment, five had persistent disability with inactive disease, and three had ongoing active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Fifteen children (42 percent) developed dystrophic calcifications. These findings suggest that low-dose prednisone is not sufficient for all patients.</p><p>Prolonged glucocorticoid therapy is associated with significant adverse effects. In children, these include growth retardation, Cushingoid appearance, elevation of blood pressure, hyperglycemia, cataracts, and osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H543524649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7899425\"><span class=\"h5\">Intravenous methylprednisolone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (IVMP) is often used in more severely affected patients because of concerns that these patients, particularly those with gastrointestinal vasculopathy, may have decreased absorption of orally administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, patients are usually concomitantly treated with daily oral glucocorticoids, starting after the three-day course of IVMP, because response failure and disease relapse are common on IVMP alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The most frequently used regimen administers IVMP at a dose of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum dose 1 g) for three consecutive days followed by additional weekly or monthly boluses as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In some cases, those treated with IVMP alone are transitioned to oral prednisone, without additional IVMP boluses, after a three-day course of IVMP. IVMP alone is not recommended for mild JDM, because its use does not decrease the total cumulative dose of glucocorticoids; there is uncertainty as to whether there is improved efficacy over oral prednisone; and there is added cost, inconvenience, and invasiveness.</p><p>A study of 139 newly diagnosed patients with JDM that compared IVMP with high-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> found no differences in outcome at 36 months follow-up after matching patients for disease characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, in this study, all of the most severely ill patients were excluded from the analysis because they all received IVMP and, therefore, could not be matched. Because of this limitation, it remains uncertain whether IVMP has a sufficiently greater benefit compared with oral prednisone in patients with severe disease to justify its cost and invasiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7899888\"><span class=\"h4\">Steroid-sparing agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A steroid-sparing agent is usually started concomitantly with systemic glucocorticoids to decrease the total dose and duration of glucocorticoids and thereby minimize their side effects.

There was a significant increase in the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) 20 level of improvement (20 percent improvement in three of six core set variables) at six months in the two combination-therapy groups compared with prednisone alone (51, 70, and 72 percent improvement for prednisone, prednisone plus cyclosporine, and prednisone plus methotrexate, respectively). Median time to clinical remission for the prednisone plus methotrexate group was 42 months, but could not be determined for the other groups due to the low number of events. Median time to treatment failure was 17 months for patients on prednisone alone and 53 months for prednisone plus cyclosporine, but could not be calculated for prednisone plus methotrexate due to the low event number. The highest rate of adverse events was seen in patients treated with prednisone plus cyclosporine. Higher rates of infection were seen in both groups of patients treated with a steroid-sparing agent compared with prednisone alone.</p><p>Another study compared 31 patients newly diagnosed with JDM who were initially treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per week) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, maximum dose 75 mg per day) with 22 similar historical controls who received prednisone therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients treated with combination therapy had a shorter average time to discontinuation of prednisone (10 versus 27 months) and a lower average cumulative prednisone dose (7.5 versus 15.1 grams) compared with those treated with only prednisone. Recovery of strength and physical function were similar in both groups. The children who received combination therapy had fewer side effects, greater height velocity, lower weight gain, and decreased risk of developing cataracts compared with controls.</p><p>Favorable outcome was reported with the early use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> in combination with IVMP in newly diagnosed patients with severe JDM characterized by dysphagia and skin ulcerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>].

Immunosuppressive therapy is generally used to treat JDM and JPM, based upon observational studies and clinical experience. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H603846500\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend high-dose glucocorticoid therapy in all patients with JDM or JPM (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This recommendation is based upon the significant increase in survival rate and clinical outcome with the routine use of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy versus low-dose glucocorticoid or no treatment. In our institution, high-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, maximum dose of 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> is the preferred glucocorticoid regimen. In other centers, the initial dose of prednisone used is individualized based on the clinical presentation and may be lower than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. We reserve the use of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (IVMP) for patients who fail to respond to oral prednisone or who have pulmonary or gastrointestinal complications that limit their ability to either take or absorb oral medications. (See <a href=\"#H7899188\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest adding a steroid-sparing agent to high-dose glucocorticoid therapy versus glucocorticoid therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In our institution, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> is the preferred steroid-sparing agent (at a once-weekly dose of approximately 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> once weekly, administered as a subcutaneous injection). Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is used as a second agent at a starting dose of 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, administered in one or two doses. (See <a href=\"#H7899888\" class=\"local\">'Steroid-sparing agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the use of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (500 to 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> every four weeks) in combination with high-dose glucocorticoid therapy in patients with severe or life-threatening disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An alternative is intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG).
