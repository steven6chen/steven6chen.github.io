In the systemic forms, the amyloid causes progressive organ dysfunction, leading to death of the patients. Over 30 proteins capable of amyloid formation have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They include immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains (AL) and Ig heavy chains (AH) in AL and AH amyloidosis, respectively; amyloid A (AA) in AA amyloidosis; beta-2 microglobulin (Ab2M) in dialysis-associated arthropathy; and amyloid beta protein (Ab) in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome. There are also hereditary forms that include transthyretin (ATTR), apolipoprotein A-I (AApoAI) and A-II (AApoAII), gelsolin (AGel), lysozyme (ALys), fibrinogen A alpha chain (AFib), and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Leukocyte chemotactic factor 2 (ALECT2) is an amyloidogenic protein for which the pathogenic mechanism is incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Amyloid fibrils can be identified in biopsy specimens both by their characteristic appearance on electron microscopy and by their ability to bind Congo red (leading to apple-green birefringence under polarized light) and thioflavine T (producing an intense yellow-green fluorescence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They are randomly organized and are approximately 8 to 10 nanometers in diameter.</p><p>Amyloid fibrils also avidly bind a normal circulating protein of uncertain physiologic significance called serum amyloid P component (SAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This observation may be of diagnostic utility since tissue amyloid deposits can be detected by scintigraphy following intravenous injection of radiolabeled SAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis#H1666860\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Serum amyloid P component scintigraphy'</a>.)</p><p>Clinically evident renal involvement mainly occurs in AL or AA amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/1,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-10</a>]. Renal involvement can also occur in some hereditary forms of amyloidosis, most commonly in AFib, AApoAI, AApoAII, ALys, and AGel, but it is rare in ATTR, especially the wild type. The deposition of Ab2m occurs in patients on prolonged maintenance dialysis; deposition in the kidney has been reported in autopsies but has no clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

A broad overview of amyloidosis, including diagnostic studies to determine the underlying etiology once a diagnosis of amyloidosis is confirmed, is presented elsewhere.

These nodules stain weakly with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and methenamine silver stain because they are composed mostly of amyloid fibrils and not extracellular matrix as in diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Scanty deposits of amyloid may go undetected by light microscopy. There is also a poor correlation between the extent of glomerular amyloid deposits and the degree of proteinuria.</p><p>There are multiple other causes of nodular glomerulosclerosis observed by light microscopy, most of which are identified by characteristic findings observed by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy.

Immunofluorescence microscopy is negative for immunoglobulins and complement in AA amyloidosis but is typically positive for lambda or kappa light chains in AL amyloid (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>). False negatives with immunofluorescence can occur in 25 to 35 percent of cases, especially if the antisera against kappa and lambda light chains used for immunofluorescence are obtained from only a single vendor. To increase sensitivity in this setting, the antisera from multiple vendors may be used, and immunoperoxidase can also be helpful. Laser dissection of the tissue followed by tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis is the gold standard but is only available in specialized laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and site of deposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of the renal disease vary with the site and degree of involvement. Proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome, as well as renal insufficiency, are common in AL and AA amyloidosis.</p><p>Once amyloidosis is confirmed by biopsy, the underlying etiology should be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Glomerular deposits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with AL amyloidosis have predominant glomerular deposition and present with proteinuria that is usually in the nephrotic range and often accompanied by edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/1,7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,13</a>].</p><p>With AL amyloidosis, for example, nearly 75 percent of patients present with proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The degree of proteinuria can range from mild to massive (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span>. The urine sediment is typically benign (reflecting the lack of inflammation), and the plasma creatinine concentration may be normal or only moderately elevated. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) develops in approximately 20 percent of those with the nephrotic syndrome and is associated with poor patient survival overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Glomerular deposits are common and associated with a poor renal prognosis in patients with AA from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As an example, 27 of 38 patients who had renal amyloidosis due to RA had glomerular deposits, and 85 percent of them progressed to ESRD during the five-year observation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1870488359\"><span class=\"h3\">Crescentic glomerulonephritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rare, crescentic glomerulonephritis can occur in patients with renal amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Almost all reported patients have had AA amyloidosis due to rheumatoid arthritis or its variants. A possible mechanism is amyloid fibril-induced ruptures in the capillary loops, leading to fibrin entry into Bowman's space. Another possibility is that the glomerulonephritis is related to rheumatoid arthritis or its therapy. Two factors argue against this hypothesis: not all affected patients have had rheumatoid arthritis; and crescentic glomerulonephritis is not a characteristic feature of renal involvement in rheumatoid arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Kidney disease'</a>.)</p><p>The possible presence of crescentic glomerulonephritis should be suspected in a patient with renal amyloidosis who develops acute renal failure in association with an active urine sediment. Optimal therapy of this problem is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the classification and treatment of rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular and tubular amyloid deposits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasional patients have a different renal presentation because the amyloid deposits are primarily limited to the vessels, leading to narrowing of the vascular lumens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80029\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80029 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. These patients usually present with slowly progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) with little or no proteinuria. Why this occurs is unclear, but the site of deposition may be determined at least in part by the size of the amyloid A fragment that is formed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Prognosis in such patients appears to be more favorable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. Similar findings have also been reported in AL amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Even less common is heavy tubular deposition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63533 \">picture 3</a>), potentially leading to signs of tubular dysfunction such as type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis or polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Acquired Fanconi syndrome has been reported in rare cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039168255\"><span class=\"h3\">Intratubular amyloid cast nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rare cases, the Ig light chain can precipitate to form intratubular casts similar to light chain cast nephropathy. However, these casts are congophilic and display fibrillar structures under electron microscopy. These patients can present with acute kidney disease similar to patients with light chain cast nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">AL AMYLOIDOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fibrils in AL amyloidosis (previously referred to as primary amyloidosis) consist of fragments of the variable portion of monoclonal light chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-lambda and anti-kappa light chain antibodies is often only weakly positive unless laser microdissection and tandem mass spectrometry are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although this disorder is the result of clonal proliferation of plasma cells, most patients do not develop multiple myeloma. Furthermore, most patients with myeloma and overproduction of light chains (light chain myeloma) do not develop amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiology of kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These findings indicate that some innate factor in the pathogenic light chain is responsible for amyloid formation. One such property is the ability to be taken up by macrophages, where the intact light chains are metabolized to pre-amyloid fragments; these fragments must then have the biochemical properties that allow them to form amyloid fibrils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the kidney, a receptor has been identified on the surface of mesangial cells that takes up light chain by endocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The pathogenic nature of the light chain determines the post-uptake trafficking and modification, which results in either amyloid formation or light chain deposition disease. Amyloidogenic light chains induce phenotypic changes that resemble a macrophage in the mesangial cell. Other intrinsic properties of the light chain may also influence fibril formation. Data suggest that the amyloidogenicity of a light chain may be determined by the pattern of mutations in the structure regions of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In AL amyloidosis, lambda light chains may be more amyloidogenic than kappa light chains. In one study of 145 patients with biopsy-proven AL amyloidosis, the ratio of patients with lambda versus kappa light chains was much higher among patients who had renal involvement (12:1) compared with those who did not (4:1). Among 84 patients with known renal amyloid, those with lambda light chains had greater urinary protein loss compared with those with kappa light chains (7 versus 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Although patients with AL amyloidosis have a monoclonal gammopathy, not all patients with renal disease and a monoclonal gammopathy have AL amyloidosis. The frequency with which this occurs was evaluated in a study of 121 patients with renal disease and a monoclonal gammopathy in which 55 patients had renal diseases unrelated to the monoclonal gammopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This, in part, reflects the relatively high frequency of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which is 3 percent in individuals over 50 years of age and 5 percent in those over 70 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Even when amyloid deposits are identified, the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy does not ensure the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. Diagnosis must be based upon the typing of the amyloid fibrils. This point cannot be overemphasized. One study showed that approximately 10 percent of patients at an amyloid referral center initially thought to have AL amyloidosis actually had hereditary amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Misdiagnosis not only results in exposure to unnecessary cytotoxic agents but also prevents the patient from receiving the appropriate therapy.</p><p>The detection of a circulating monoclonal protein in these patients can be challenging. The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Response to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that influence renal response to therapy include the degree of baseline proteinuria and the serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31</a>]. This was shown in a study of 122 patients with AL amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At a median follow-up of 45 months post-therapy, multivariate analysis found that low baseline proteinuria (and cardiac troponin T) levels predicted a renal response, which was defined as greater than 50 percent reduction in proteinuria with less than 25 percent decline in renal function. A hematologic response (72 percent of patients) also correlated significantly with renal response (43 percent of patients). Ninety-six percent of renal responders also had a hematologic response versus only 54 percent of renal nonresponders.</p><p>Thus, the goal of therapy is related to hematologic response. Elimination of the monoclonal protein and the plasma cell clone may lead to reversal of organ damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, the small size of the monoclonal protein and low clonal plasma cells load often makes determination of hematologic response difficult. This process has been made easier with the serum-free light chain assay, which has a sensitivity more than 1000 times that of serum protein electrophoresis and 300 times that of immunofixation. In separate studies, significant (&gt;90 percent) reduction or normalization of serum-free light chain levels after autologous stem cell transplantation was associated with better organ response and improved overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases#H863317\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis and light and heavy chain deposition diseases&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>A hematologic response to therapy is strongly associated with improved outcomes even in patients with advanced amyloid-related renal disease at the time of diagnosis. This was shown in a study of 84 patients with AL amyloidosis and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Forty-five patients had renal-limited amyloidosis, and 39 had both renal and cardiac involvement. At baseline, median eGFR and 24-hour urine protein excretion were 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> and 6.2 grams, respectively. Among the 78 patients who received chemotherapy, 55 percent received a bortezomib-based regimen as first-line therapy. Patients who achieved &ge;90 percent reduction in the amyloidogenic free light chain (defined as the difference between the involved and uninvolved free light chain [dFLC]) within three months of baseline had better median overall survival and a prolonged time to dialysis (23.0 months versus 6.1 months) compared with those who achieved a lesser degree of clonal response. However, achieving the same reduction in dFLC but after three months from baseline was not associated with a benefit in renal survival. Thus, patients with AL amyloidosis and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) at presentation may benefit from treatment, but the magnitude and speed of hematologic response appear to be critical factors in determining outcome.</p><p>A separate but related issue is the development of renal disease after therapy for AL amyloidosis. In a study of 173 amyloid patients who underwent high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, acute renal failure was observed in approximately 20 percent, with nearly one-half eventually recovering renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">AA AMYLOIDOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AA amyloidosis (previously referred to as secondary amyloidosis), also called reactive amyloidosis or amyloidosis AA, occurs in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (adult or juvenile) currently accounts for up to 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/1,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37</a>]. The other major conditions associated with AA amyloidosis are ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic pyogenic infections (bronchiectasis, osteomyelitis, chronic skin or decubitus ulcers, intravenous drug users, paraplegics, or tuberculosis), inflammatory bowel disease (primarily Crohn's disease), cystic fibrosis, some neoplasms (particularly renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma) and Familial Mediterranean fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>A number of genetic disorders associated with chronic inflammation have been reported to cause AA amyloidosis. These include Familial Mediterranean fever, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and Muckle-Wells syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, not all autoimmune diseases (including those associated with chronic inflammation) lead to amyloid formation, as AA amyloidosis is rare in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and diabetes mellitus (except in the islets themselves).

Cleavage in circulating <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages</span> results in the generation of smaller fragments, called AA protein, which can then deposit in the tissues.

Mutations in a number of proteins can result in relatively selective renal deposition. These include transthyretin (prealbumin), fibrinogen A alpha chain, lysozyme, apolipoprotein A-I (AApoAI) and A-II (AApoAII), and gelsolin (AGel) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/42-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-47</a>]. Certain hereditary amyloidoses can also present with tubulointerstitial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/43,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,48</a>].

This particular disorder is of pathogenetic interest because the renal failure is due to peritubular and interstitial amyloid deposits. The glomeruli are generally spared, and the patients have little or no increase in protein excretion.</p><p/><p>The diagnosis of hereditary amyloidosis can be difficult since 3 percent of individuals over 50 years of age and 5 percent of individuals over 70 years of age have a monoclonal protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients with hereditary amyloidosis and a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance can be misdiagnosed as having AL amyloidosis. One study of 350 patients with a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis found that 9.7 percent had genetic mutations associated with hereditary types of amyloidosis that were subsequently confirmed with other tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>This illustrates the important fact that the presence of a monoclonal protein cannot be used to confirm the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. In patients in whom the amyloid cannot be typed by immunohistochemical techniques, genetic analysis should be performed to rule out hereditary amyloidosis to avoid exposure to unnecessary cytotoxic agents. Laser dissection of the tissue followed by tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis provides an accurate diagnosis and is considered to be the &quot;gold standard&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3467991930\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER RENAL AMYLOIDOSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H407882707\"><span class=\"h2\">Apolipoprotein A-IV (AApoAIV) amyloidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AApoAIV amyloidosis is a rare form of renal amyloidosis that has been described in patients presenting with slowly progressive renal insufficiency and minimal or absent proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. In contrast with apolipoprotein A-I (AApoAI) and A-II (AApoAII) amyloidoses, which are both hereditary forms of amyloidosis, no genetic mutations have yet been identified among patients with AApoAIV amyloidosis. A kidney biopsy with laser microdissection and mass spectrometry is required to establish the diagnosis. Similar to patients with AApoAI amyloidosis, patients with AApoAIV amyloidosis have Congo red-positive amyloid deposits that are restricted to the renal medulla (mostly peritubular and interstitial) and spare the cortex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1218013536\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2-associated (ALECT2) amyloidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ALECT2 amyloidosis is a systemic form of amyloidosis with predominantly renal and liver involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/4,5,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,51</a>]. Most reported cases (88 to 92 percent) occur in elderly Hispanics of Mexican origin, although Punjabis, First Nations people in British Columbia, and Native Americans also have a predisposition for this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>]. The pathogenesis of ALECT2 amyloidosis is not well understood.

A kidney biopsy, preferably with laser microdissection and mass spectrometry, is required to make the diagnosis.

In general, patients with ALECT2 amyloidosis have better overall survival than those with AL or AA amyloidosis, possibly due to the absence or rare occurrence of cardiac involvement. However, renal survival is relatively poor, with up to 39 percent of patients progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

However, increased survival and renal transplantation in AL amyloidosis has been reported.

Three-year graft survival was similar in the two groups (53 versus 49 percent), although patient survival was lower in the amyloid group (50 versus 80 percent), predominantly due to infectious and cardiovascular complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer-term graft survival also may be excellent. This was illustrated in a report of 23 recipients of live donor kidneys who had renal amyloidosis, of whom 16 had Familial Mediterranean fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Allograft survival at 5 and 10 years was 80 and 66 percent, respectively.

However, graft loss due to recurrence is uncommon. In Familial Mediterranean fever, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> in a dose of 1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> can prevent the development of proteinuria (probably a marker for recurrent amyloidosis); lower doses are less predictably effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Recurrence appears to be common in patients with fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis who received kidney transplantation alone. In the largest series to date, recurrence was noted in four of eight successful kidney allografts. Three of the grafts were lost as a direct result of recurrence (median of six years), with one remaining functional after 12 years. By comparison, seven patients have undergone combined liver-kidney transplantation and no recurrence has been found in the six surviving patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Recurrence is also a problem in AL amyloidosis. Two separate strategies have been used. One restores renal function first with a living donor kidney transplant prior to an autologous stem cell transplantation to treat the plasma cell dyscrasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This approach was evaluated in a report from the Mayo Clinic, which described their experience with the first eight patients with ESRD treated with this regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Of eight patients who received a living donor kidney transplant, five subsequently underwent successful autologous stem cell transplantation, two died (one prior to stem cell transplantation and one after stem cell transplantation), and one patient elected not to undergo stem cell transplantation. At follow-up 0.4 to 2.3 years post-stem cell transplantation, renal function was adequate in the five survivors who underwent both procedures (serum creatinine concentration ranging from 0.9 to 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [80 to 168 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span>.</p><p>Alternatively, autologous stem cell transplantation can be performed in AL patients with ESRD. Kidney transplantation can be considered once hematologic complete response is achieved. Boston University reported their experience of this approach with 15 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-amyloidosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. While toxicity, especially mucositis, and transfusion requirement were greater in the ESRD population, overall survival and response were similar to patients without ESRD. One advantage of this approach is avoidance of immunosuppression during autologous stem cell transplantation, which can be challenging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66473506\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Renal involvement occurs in AL amyloidosis, characterized by the deposition of immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains, or AA (secondary) amyloidosis, characterized by the deposition of amyloid A. Renal involvement may also occur in some hereditary forms of amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary renal amyloidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of the renal disease vary with the site and degree of involvement. The most common presentation of AL and AA amyloidosis is heavy proteinuria which is associated with glomerular deposits. Patients with vascular deposits present with slowly progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) with little or no proteinuria. Less commonly, patients with tubular deposits present with tubular dysfunction such as type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis or polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and in rare cases, Fanconi syndrome. Crescentic glomerulonephritis is extremely rare. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and site of deposition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology of renal amyloidosis depends upon the type. An abnormal clonal proliferation of plasma cells causes AL amyloidosis. Chronic inflammatory diseases cause AA amyloidosis. Adult or juvenile idiopathic rheumatoid arthritis is the major cause of AA amyloidosis. Other major conditions associated with AA amyloidosis include ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic pyogenic infections, inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, some neoplasms and Familial Mediterranean fever. Less commonly, genetic disorders associated with chronic inflammation may cause AA amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'AL amyloidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'AA amyloidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment depends upon the type of amyloidosis. The treatment of AL amyloidosis is directed at elimination of the monoclonal protein and the plasma cell clone which may lead to reversal of organ damage. Factors that influence the renal response to therapy include the degree of baseline proteinuria and the serum creatinine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases#H863317\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis and light and heavy chain deposition diseases&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The treatment of AA amyloidosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of AA (secondary) amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can be treated with either dialysis or renal transplantation. Hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) appear to be equally effective. The prognosis for those who require dialysis is not good, though somewhat better for those with AA compared to AL amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis and renal transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The experience with renal transplantation is mainly limited to AA amyloidosis. Limited data suggest that graft survival is similar but patient survival is lower in patients with AA amyloidosis compared to other forms of renal disease. Recurrent amyloid deposition in the transplant occurs in 20 to 33 percent of cases due to continued activity of the underlying disease, but graft loss due to recurrence is uncommon. Kidney transplantation is reasonable in selected patients with AL amyloidosis.
