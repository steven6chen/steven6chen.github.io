The approach to treatment of PAN depends upon the following variables, which require assessment before beginning therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The level of disease severity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of isolated cutaneous PAN or other <span class=\"nowrap\">isolated/single-organ</span> disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence or absence of viral hepatitis</p><p/><p>The optimal therapy of PAN remains uncertain, and studies of treatment for PAN have been complicated by the admixture of patients with PAN, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and sometimes eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss) within study cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The efficacy of glucocorticoids in the majority of patients with mild disease, and of glucocorticoids plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> in patients with more severe disease, has been well-demonstrated in observational studies in PAN, but there are few randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/2,3,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5-9</a>]. The treatment approach in PAN is also derived from indirect evidence of the efficacy of various medications and drug regiments in other forms of necrotizing vasculitis, particularly MPA and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of polyarteritis nodosa will be reviewed here.

Laboratory testing should also include tests of renal function and disease (urinalysis, serum creatinine) and baseline complete blood count. Patients in whom the diagnosis was established without a detailed examination and testing still require such testing to obtain the information needed to determine the extent of disease, to evaluate for comorbidities, and to select the most appropriate therapeutic interventions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In anticipation of use of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications, clinicians may choose to test for diabetes mellitus, latent tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and also ensure patients are up-to-date with age-appropriate vaccinations, although the use of live vaccines may be contraindicated depending on their timing relative to initiations of therapy with immunosuppressive drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91884 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18234207\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity of disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18623799\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild versus more severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important factor in determining which medications will be used and the doses employed is whether the patient has only mild disease or disease that is of greater severity. We use the following definitions, which correspond to distinctions made in clinical trials that have examined the benefits of different agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/3,4,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild disease &ndash; Patients with mild disease include those with constitutional symptoms, arthritis, anemia, and skin lesions, but with normal renal function and an absence of significant cardiac, neurologic, gastrointestinal, or other organ- or life-threatening manifestations. Patients with mild disease should generally be treated initially with glucocorticoids alone. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mild PAN'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate to severe disease &ndash; Patients with moderate to severe disease include those who typically exhibit more serious disease manifestations than patients with mild disease, such as any degree of renal insufficiency, new or worsened hypertension considered secondary to the vasculitis, symptomatic arterial stenosis, aneurysms, or any ischemic disease (eg, limb, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system ischemia). These patients are generally treated initially with glucocorticoids plus a second immunosuppressive agent, typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. Subsequent management for the maintenance of remission usually involves switching from cyclophosphamide to an alternative, less toxic, immunosuppressive agent. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Moderate and severe PAN'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The goals of therapy are the same in both mild and moderate to severe disease. The aim is to achieve remission, defined as the absence of active disease, including the resolution of potentially reversible symptoms and findings and the prevention of further progression of arterial lesions or organ damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88910480\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated versus multi-organ disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to isolated or single-organ PAN may differ from the approach to multisystem disease, depending upon the affected organ or tissue.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous PAN &ndash; PAN confined to the skin is generally treated similarly to mild systemic PAN. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;, section on 'Skin disease'</a> and <a href=\"#H88910276\" class=\"local\">'Isolated cutaneous PAN'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Isolated/single-organ</span> PAN &ndash; Patients with isolated or single-organ involvement, sometimes identified at the time of an operative procedure, may not require further therapy, but should be evaluated for evidence of other manifestations and monitored subsequently.

In patients in whom polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the major focus of therapy is the use of antiviral agents for treatment of the underlying viral disorder. PAN continues to be associated with HBV in a substantial minority of cases, although this rate is decreasing in countries with comprehensive HBV vaccination programs. Many fewer cases of PAN are associated with HCV, which should be differentiated from HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H3458586686\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Indications for antiviral therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with mild PAN and evidence of infection with HBV or HCV, we suggest treating initially with antivirals rather than using immunosuppressive medications. Some patients with severe manifestations of hepatitis virus-associated PAN may benefit from short-term treatment with glucocorticoids and plasma exchange until antiviral therapy becomes effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There are no randomized trials or large case series to guide decision-making in such patients; we base our approach upon the available trials in viral hepatitis and clinical experience. The treatment of HBV and HCV and the treatment of renal disease due to PAN in patients with one of these infections are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease associated with hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of renal disease associated with hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Polyarteritis nodosa'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H3458586686\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Indications for antiviral therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with persistent manifestations of PAN who have an inadequate response of the PAN to treatment for viral hepatitis alone or are intolerant of such treatment, we treat the manifestations of the vasculitis with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications, depending upon the severity of the vasculitis, using the regimens that would be employed in patients without viral infection (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mild PAN'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Moderate and severe PAN'</a> below). In patients with viral infection who are treated with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive medications, particular attention should be given to the need for close monitoring of the status of the underlying viral infection and the potential for added toxicity from the immunosuppressive therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MILD PAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mild disease, and without evidence of hepatitis, can usually be treated initially with glucocorticoids alone, although about half of these patients will require an additional agent at some point during their treatment. The treatment approach in patients with hepatitis B or C infection is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H1145933\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment of mild PAN'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1146184\" class=\"local\">'Disease resistant to treatment with glucocorticoids alone'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2148010\" class=\"local\">'Associated hepatitis B or C infection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145933\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment of mild PAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with relatively mild disease and those with isolated cutaneous disease, we suggest initial monotherapy with oral glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily, up to a maximum of 60 to 80 mg daily). The initial dose should usually be continued for four weeks, at which time tapering of the glucocorticoids should begin if substantial improvement has occurred. In such patients, substantial improvement would be characterized by findings such as resolution of <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/arthralgia,</span> skin lesions, and constitutional symptoms; and by the absence of new disease manifestations and of progression of neuropathy, renal disease, or other arterial lesions. We then taper the dose of prednisone steadily, but fairly slowly as long as the response is maintained, until a dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is reached by approximately month three to four. The tapering schedule is then slowed (eg, dose reduction by 2.5 mg daily every 14 days). This results in an overall course of approximately six to eight months until glucocorticoids are discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H18623799\" class=\"local\">'Mild versus more severe disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88910276\" class=\"local\">'Isolated cutaneous PAN'</a> below.)</p><p>This approach is based upon the potential benefit of glucocorticoids alone seen in retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>] and in patients with mild polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and microscopic polyangiitis in the nonrandomized initial phase of a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of patients with PAN that was not limited to those with mild disease found that patients treated with glucocorticoids alone, when compared with clinically similar patients who did not received glucocorticoids, experienced substantially longer median survival (63 versus 3 months) and five-year survival (53 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Glucocorticoids have not been compared with treatment with placebo alone in a randomized trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of patients with mild PAN or microscopic polyangiitis designed to compare <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> in patients who had sustained disease or relapse despite glucocorticoid therapy, 79 percent of patients achieved remission with initial glucocorticoid therapy prior to the randomized trial period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; half of these patients had a sustained remission without requiring additional immunosuppression.</p><p/><p>Alternatively, some experts advocate longer treatment courses with glucocorticoids, especially if no other immunosuppressive agent is prescribed concurrently, but trials have not been performed to prospectively compare the long-term outcomes of different durations of therapy. Some patients may require a slower taper.</p><p>Those who respond to glucocorticoids alone are spared the risk of adverse effects associated with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or other immunosuppressive drugs. However, treatment with glucocorticoids may be associated with multiple adverse effects. The risks of systemic glucocorticoids and prophylaxis for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1146184\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease resistant to treatment with glucocorticoids alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with mild disease or isolated cutaneous PAN who are resistant to or intolerant of the dose of glucocorticoids required for disease control, we suggest the addition of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (20 to 25 mg once weekly) to glucocorticoid therapy to allow use of a lower dose of glucocorticoids while achieving or maintaining disease control. Such patients include those who do not respond to glucocorticoids alone within three months, whose glucocorticoid dose cannot be tapered to an acceptable level (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> without experiencing a relapse of disease, who are at high risk of adverse effects for the expected treatment course with glucocorticoids, or in whom the adverse effects of continued glucocorticoids in the dose being used are unacceptable. The choice between methotrexate and azathioprine depends upon the individual toxicity profiles, and patient and clinician preferences regarding dosing and administration of the drugs. Methotrexate is likely faster-acting, but should be avoided in patients with renal disease or hepatitis. We thus prefer azathioprine in patients with renal disease and in patients with hepatic disease, who should be closely monitored for hepatotoxicity.</p><p>In patients with mild disease who require an immunosuppressive agent in addition to glucocorticoids, we suggest treatment with the added immunosuppressive agent for at least one year following attainment of clinical remission, based upon our clinical experience in patients with PAN and other forms of systemic vasculitis. As with other systemic vasculitides, some patients may require an extended course of treatment or resumption of treatment with low-dose glucocorticoids (&le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) to prevent recurrence of mild symptoms; low-dose glucocorticoids may be required even in patients also receiving another immunosuppressive agent. The approach to tapering of the glucocorticoids is the same as in patients who do not require an additional immunosuppressive agent. (See <a href=\"#H1145933\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment of mild PAN'</a> above.)</p><p>There are few randomized trials in patients with PAN that have directly compared the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, but we generally avoid the use of cyclophosphamide in patients with mild PAN. One small randomized trial has shown similar benefit but lower toxicity with azathioprine compared with cyclophosphamide in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additionally, cyclophosphamide has greater toxicity compared with azathioprine or methotrexate in our experience in PAN and in trials in other forms of systemic necrotizing vasculitis, as well as in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>]. Another small trial of 95 patients with a case mix of PAN, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), and microscopic polyangiitis compared the addition of azathioprine or placebo to standard daily oral glucocorticoids for patients classified as having nonsevere disease (as defined by a Five-Factor Score [FFS] of zero) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] (see <a href=\"#H12933849\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> below). The trial found no benefit of azathioprine in terms of rates of attaining remission, risk of relapse, or cumulative dose of glucocorticoids. However, the admixture of patients with three forms of vasculitis, of which only 19 out of 51 (37 percent) had PAN, makes interpretation and implementation of these results difficult for the treatment of PAN. The small sample size of patients with PAN precluded disease-specific subset efficacy analysis. More data are needed on the efficacy of azathioprine and methotrexate as &quot;steroid-sparing&quot; agents for patients with mild PAN to guide therapy.</p><p>We prefer to use either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> (2000 to 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].

The goal of the glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive treatment in this setting is to treat the acute inflammatory process and stabilize the patient until the antiviral therapy becomes effective. The treatment approach in patients with hepatitis B or C infection is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1147100\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid regimen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1147107\" class=\"local\">'Cyclophosphamide regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>This approach is supported by observations from long-term follow-up studies in several cohorts of patients with PAN and other vasculitides that patients with more serious disease manifestations (eg, renal insufficiency, cardiac disease, mesenteric artery ischemia) had better outcomes, including rates of survival, when treated with an initial combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and glucocorticoids compared with those who were treated with glucocorticoids alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/3,4,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6,8</a>]. In our experience, use of oral and intravenous cyclophosphamide results in a similar degree of benefit. While the comparative efficacy of treatment with oral and intravenous cyclophosphamide has been studied in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, similar comparisons in patients with PAN have not been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>Additionally, one randomized trial of patients with moderate to severe disease, involving 18 patients with PAN and 47 with microscopic polyangiitis compared treatment with 12 or 6 monthly pulses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, in addition to glucocorticoid therapy; the group treated with 12 monthly pulses of cyclophosphamide had a reduced risk of relapse and a higher event free survival rate compared with those receiving only six monthly pulses over a mean follow-up period of 32 months (hazard ratios 0.34 and 0.44, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Hypertension can be a major therapeutic issue in patients with polyarteritis nodosa. The elevation in blood pressure may be severe and is often mediated by ischemia-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The intrarenal large vessel disease in PAN may, therefore, be the functional equivalent of extrarenal vascular disease in bilateral renal artery stenosis.

However, they may worsen renal function due to removal of the effect of angiotensin II on autoregulation and maintenance of the glomerular filtration rate.

Patients must be monitored for the possibility of disease relapse, particularly in organ systems involved at disease onset. However, it is important to recognize that patients with PAN may have relapses of disease that include clinical manifestations of vasculitis not present at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. We generally see patients at least monthly during the initial phase of therapy, until clinically stable, then at least every three months during the first two years of treatment.</p><p>We continue to follow patients who have been in remission for two years every three to six months. Even after two years of remission, all patients should be followed indefinitely at some reasonable frequency (eg, every 6 to 12 months) since relapses may occur years after initial presentation and attainment of remission, which may be defined for patients with PAN as the absence of any evidence of active disease. In addition to routine physical examinations, including blood pressure testing, a review of systems, and laboratory monitoring for drug toxicities, a serum creatinine and urinalysis should be obtained. New symptoms or findings should be evaluated for their potential to represent recurrent vasculitis, even if such symptoms or findings are different from the original presenting manifestations of disease. Additionally, patients must be followed and treated for the medium- and long-term clinical sequelae of both treatment toxicities and disease-related long-term organ damage.</p><p>Patients with cutaneous-only PAN or other single-organ presentations of PAN must also be followed regularly for the possible development of disease in new organ systems. In addition to clinical examinations and appropriate follow-up of patient-reported symptoms, periodic testing of serum creatinine and a urinalysis can help monitor for asymptomatic renal disease.</p><p>Follow-up angiography is not required unless there are signs or symptoms suggestive of new disease, concerns for ischemia that may require intervention, or aneurysms that are at risk for expansion or rupture and may require intervention. Depending on the anatomic location and size of affected arteries, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomographic (CT) angiography may be substituted for catheter-based angiography. The choice of which imaging modality (MR, CT, or catheter-based) to use will depend upon the availability of equipment and expertise at a medical center and may be influenced by an interest in utilizing the same approach used for prior evaluations to allow for direct comparisons.</p><p>Some complications of PAN can occur when the disease is clinically inactive, since healing of inflamed vessels can lead to progressive narrowing of the vascular lumina and resultant organ ischemia. Such changes should be distinguished from active disease, as they require appropriate supportive care rather than immunosuppression. As an example, a slowly progressive elevation in the serum creatinine concentration occurs in some patients in whom the signs of active vasculitis (such as systemic symptoms and an active urine sediment) have abated. The primary problem in this situation is diminished glomerular flow, not vascular inflammation. Sometimes serial angiograms or a renal biopsy is required to help differentiate active from inactive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10269109\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of recurrent disease depends upon the severity of the flare and whether recurrence occurs on or off immunosuppressive treatment. Mild disease recurrence may be treated by use of glucocorticoids alone, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increase in dose of immunosuppressive drug, depending upon the patient's treatment at the time of disease exacerbation or recurrence. Moderate to severe relapse requires reinitiation of remission-induction treatment (see <a href=\"#H1147024\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment of moderate and severe PAN'</a> above).

The FFS was revised in 2011 based upon additional data and for PAN now only includes four factors associated with increased mortality: i) age &gt;65 years, ii) cardiac symptoms, iii) gastrointestinal involvement, and iv) renal insufficiency (plasma creatinine &gt;1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [150 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The original FFS had included central nervous system disease (dropped from the score in 2011) but did not include age (included in 2011). The FFS has been used to stratify patients in treatment studies; this tool is helpful in both interpreting the data and formulating an approach to treatment of PAN. However, the FFS is based upon mortality and is not designed to predict either relapse or long-term morbidity, both of which are also important outcomes that influence treatment decisions in PAN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1147049\"><span class=\"h2\">Relapse rates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the proportion of patients with PAN with monocyclic disease courses (ie, a single episode of disease activity without a subsequent relapse) is substantially higher than in many other forms of vasculitis, especially the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated diseases (granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's], microscopic polyangiitis [MPA], and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Churg-Strauss]), the relapse rate in PAN is still substantial. For example, in a series of 348 patients, the one and five-year relapse rates for patients with non-HBV-associated PAN were at least 9.2 percent and 24 percent, respectively; the relapse rates for HBV-associated PAN were lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few data exist concerning the outcome of patients with PAN and end-stage renal disease who undergo renal transplantation. Among 112 patients with PAN reported in the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) registry, transplantation was associated with significantly lower patient (77 versus 91 percent) and first cadaveric allograft (60 versus 69 percent) survival rates compared with those diagnosed with other renal diseases (eg, glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, toxic nephropathies, and cystic kidney disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

We use an initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum 60 to 80 mg daily), typically for approximately four weeks, at which time slow tapering of the glucocorticoids (over approximately six to eight months) can be started if substantial improvement has occurred. We also employ this approach in patients with isolated cutaneous disease. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mild PAN'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mild disease who are resistant to or intolerant of the dose of glucocorticoids required for disease control, we suggest the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, rather than adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Such patients include those who do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, whose glucocorticoid dose cannot be tapered to an acceptable level (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> without experiencing a relapse of disease, who are at high risk of adverse effects for the expected treatment course with glucocorticoids, or in whom the adverse effects of continued glucocorticoids in the dose being used are unacceptable. The usual doses are azathioprine, 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily; or methotrexate, 20 to 25 mg once weekly. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil (2000 to 3000 mg daily) is an alternative in patients unable to use azathioprine or methotrexate. (See <a href=\"#H1146184\" class=\"local\">'Disease resistant to treatment with glucocorticoids alone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with moderate to severe disease (eg, any evidence of renal insufficiency, significant proteinuria, gastrointestinal, cardiac, or neurologic involvement), we recommend treatment with both glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> rather than glucocorticoids alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

The initial oral prednisone dose is continued for two to four weeks, until significant improvement is observed. The dose should then be tapered slowly, for an overall course of approximately six to eight months. (See <a href=\"#H1147100\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclophosphamide</a> may be administered by either intravenous or oral administration. We prefer the use of intravenous pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide (600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> every two weeks for three doses, then every four weeks for at least four months and until a stable remission has been achieved, but for no greater than 12 months.

(See <a href=\"#H1147472\" class=\"local\">'Remission-maintenance immunosuppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the infrequent patient with moderate to severe PAN who has ongoing severe or worsening disease that is not controlled by treatment with glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> within two to three months, we treat with pulse glucocorticoids (eg, 1000 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> administered intravenously daily for 3 days), followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily taken orally) and switch from cyclophosphamide to a different immunosuppressive agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (20 to 25 mg once weekly).

(See <a href=\"#H10269147\" class=\"local\">'Resistant disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mild PAN and evidence of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), we suggest treating most patients initially with antivirals only, rather than also treating initially with immunosuppressive medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some patients with severe manifestations of hepatitis virus-associated PAN may benefit from short-term treatment with glucocorticoids and plasma exchange until antiviral therapy becomes effective. We do not use plasma exchange in patients with idiopathic PAN that is not HBV-related. In patients with persistent manifestations of PAN who are unresponsive to or intolerant of treatment for viral hepatitis alone, we cautiously treat the manifestations of the vasculitis with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medication depending upon the severity of the vasculitis.

Such patients should be monitored closely for worsening of renal function.
