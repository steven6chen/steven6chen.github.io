It happens in babies who are born early and have a lung condition called &quot;respiratory distress syndrome,&quot; or &quot;RDS.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113836550\"><span class=\"h1\">How do doctors usually find BPD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Babies who get BPD are already in a part of the hospital called the &quot;neonatal intensive care unit,&quot; or &quot;NICU.&quot; That's because they have RDS. Doctors and nurses in the NICU take care of newborn babies who are sick or were born too early. They watch babies with RDS for signs that their breathing problems are not going away.</p><p>Doctors know a baby has BPD if the breathing problems are still happening 4 weeks before the baby's original due date. Signs that a baby still has problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needing extra oxygen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needing a machine to help with breathing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113836567\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Babies in the NICU get daily exams. If a baby has breathing problems, he or she will also get chest X-rays. The X-rays can show signs of BPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113836582\"><span class=\"h1\">How is BPD treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most babies who have BPD get better in 2 to 4 months. Depending on your baby's situation, doctors might keep giving treatments to make sure he or she gets enough oxygen. These treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a breathing machine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving extra oxygen through a special hood, tubes in the nose, or a face mask</p><p/><p>Other treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving breast milk or formula that has extra nutrition &ndash; Babies who have BPD can use up more energy than other babies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving the baby less fluid &ndash; This can help the lungs work better because it can lower the amount of fluid in the lungs. If this does not work well, doctors can also give medicines called &quot;diuretics&quot; to help pull fluid out of the lungs. This makes breathing easier. But these medicines are not usually needed.</p><p/><p>If your baby has BPD, he or she might be in the hospital for several weeks or months after birth. The doctors and nurses in the NICU can help you spend time with your baby while he or she is there.</p><p>Babies with BPD can have other medical problems after they leave the hospital. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure &ndash; This usually lasts about 4 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye and ear problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development problems &ndash; Babies who had BPD might not learn to do normal activities as quickly as other babies the same age.</p><p/><p>The doctors and nurses in the NICU will watch for these problems and help you get treatment if they happen to your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113836596\"><span class=\"h1\">Can BPD be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can do some things to lower the risk that a baby will get RDS. This is important because having RDS is what puts a baby at risk for BPD. Doctors can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give steroid medicines to a pregnant woman who might have her baby early &ndash; This lowers the risk of RDS that can lead to BPD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your baby treatments to lower the risk of RDS, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Using a device called a &quot;continuous positive airway pressure&quot; machine (or &quot;CPAP&quot;) to help the baby breathe</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Giving the baby a medicine called &quot;surfactant&quot; to help the lungs work better</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113836611\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
