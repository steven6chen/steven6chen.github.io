Different things can cause rectovaginal fistula, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury during labor and childbirth &ndash; This is the most common cause.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation to the area (to treat cancer)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crohn disease (a disorder that can cause diarrhea, belly pain, and other digestive problems)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114039418\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a rectovaginal fistula?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gas or bowel movements passing out of the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bad smell coming from the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or irritation in or near the vagina</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114039433\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for a rectovaginal fistula?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse might be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. For the exam, the doctor will put gloved fingers inside your vagina and your anus at the same time.</p><p>But you might need tests that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blue dye test &ndash; For this test, the doctor or nurse uses a blunt needle to put a blue dye into your rectum. He or she then checks for blue dye in your vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proctoscopy &ndash; For this test, the doctor puts a narrow tube with a light at the end into the rectum to check the area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as an MRI or a CT scan &ndash; These tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114039448\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a rectovaginal fistula treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rectovaginal fistulas are treated with an operation to close and repair the fistula. After surgery, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink only fluids for several days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat foods that will help you have fewer and smaller bowel movements. Your doctor or nurse will tell you more about this diet and how long you need to stay on it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take &quot;sitz&quot; baths &ndash; This is a shallow, warm bath that helps clean and heal the vaginal area. Take them twice a day for 30 minutes each for 2 to 3 days.</p><p/></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
