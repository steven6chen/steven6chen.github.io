It happens when the body's infection-fighting system attacks and damages nerve cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83278\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83278 \">figure 1</a>). The infection-fighting system is called the &quot;immune system.&quot; When it attacks the body's own cells, this is called an &quot;autoimmune response.&quot;</p><p>Many people call multiple sclerosis &quot;MS.&quot;</p><p>There are several types of MS. Most children have a type called &quot;relapsing-remitting MS.&quot; In this type, the MS symptoms come and go. When a person has new or worse symptoms than usual, this is called an attack or a &quot;relapse.&quot; An attack can last several days or weeks. It usually goes away slowly. Between attacks, a person might feel normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769250\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of MS in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision problems, eye pain, and odd eye movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or off-balance &ndash; This can cause the child to fall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness and stiffness in the face or an arm or leg &ndash; This usually affects just one side of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems controlling the bowels or bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired, depressed, or less active than usual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache, seizures, or altered consciousness &ndash; These are less common symptoms of MS in children, but they happen sometimes. Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. During a seizure, a child might have sudden jerking or twitching movements. &quot;Altered consciousness&quot; might involve confusion, changes in mood, trouble staying awake, or seeming &quot;out of it.&quot;</p><p/><p>Every child with MS does not get all the symptoms. Some children might have just one or a few symptoms. The symptoms might come and go at different times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769265\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child should see a doctor or nurse right away if he or she has any of the symptoms above and you do not know the cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769280\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for MS in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes and no. Doctors can order tests, but the tests might not show MS right away. With MS, symptoms and test results can change with time. Sometimes, doctors have to check a child again, or do more tests, before they are sure about MS.</p><p>If the doctor thinks your child might have MS, he or she can order the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; This imaging test uses powerful magnets to create pictures of the inside of the body. To look for MS, doctors usually do an MRI of the brain and sometimes of the spinal cord. The MRI can show if the nerves are damaged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture (also known as a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor puts a thin needle in the lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He or she will do lab tests on the spinal fluid. Changes in this fluid can be a sign of MS.</p><p/><p>The doctor will also do an exam and ask about your child's symptoms. Tell the doctor or nurse if someone in your family has MS.</p><p>Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to MS in children. The doctor can order other tests to look for these conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769297\"><span class=\"h1\">How is MS in children treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors cannot cure MS in children or adults. But they can give medicines to treat the attacks. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines &ndash; These can make attacks shorter. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Disease-modifying therapy&quot; &ndash; These medicines lower the chance of having an MS attack. These medicines do not cure MS. Some of these medicines come as injections (shots). Many children learn to give themselves the shots.</p><p/><p>Doctors can also treat symptoms of MS. Many people with MS, including children, get very tired. They might also feel depressed, have problems thinking, or have muscle spasms. If your child has any symptoms, tell the doctor or nurse, even if you do not think they have anything to do with MS. The doctor or nurse can offer your child special treatments for those symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769312\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you just learned your child has MS, try to stay positive. In most children, MS is a very slow disease.</p><p>The medicines used to treat MS are often very good at keeping attacks from happening. Some people with relapsing-remitting MS go many months or years without having attacks. Even so, doctors cannot tell how fast MS will get worse for any one person. Some children do very well. Other children lose the ability to do some things over years or decades.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98769327\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-sclerosis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Multiple sclerosis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
