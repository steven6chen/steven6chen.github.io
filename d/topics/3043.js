After a bolus of potassium intake, these normal physiologic processes preserve the intra- and extracellular balance via transcellular potassium movement regulated by cell membrane Na-K-ATPase (mediated by insulin and alpha and beta-2 adrenergic agonists), and urinary potassium excretion (mostly mediated by aldosterone). In children, positive potassium balance is needed for growth, whereas in adults, homeostasis is directed towards a zero potassium balance.</p><p>Normal serum and plasma potassium concentrations in children and adolescents are similar to levels in adults. However, infants have a higher normal range of potassium because of their reduced urinary potassium excretion caused by their relatively increased aldosterone insensitivity and decreased glomerular filtration rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501 \">table 1</a>).

However, this is unlikely to occur with correct prescription and administration of these substances in a child with normal cardiovascular and renal function.

Metabolic acidosis is often caused by or is associated with a decreased effective arterial blood volume, which may impact urinary potassium excretion.

Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant condition that encodes for a protein of the sodium channel of skeletal muscles. In these patients, the sodium channel closes too slowly, leading to intracellular potassium movement into the extracellular space, which results in hyperkalemia and muscle weakness. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis can present in infancy, and needs to be considered in any young child with hyperkalemia and concomitant muscle weakness.

In these patients, sodium and water reabsorption is increased in the proximal portion of the nephron, resulting in a reduction in sodium delivery to the collecting tubule. This leads to functional impairment of urinary potassium excretion as there is a limited amount of sodium available for potassium exchange in the collecting tubule. Although this phenomenon is often referred to as a functional renal tubular acidosis (RTA), or impaired aldosterone mediated urinary potassium and acid excretion, there is no abnormality in the ion channels or mineralocorticoid receptors of the distal nephron. Such patients are at risk for developing hyperkalemia with potassium administration in IV fluids or medications.

In addition, they have an increased resistance to aldosterone.

In its autosomal recessive form (pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1), severe mutations in the epithelial sodium channel in the distal tubule have been described, and affected patients generally present early in life, have salt wasting from aldosterone targeted organs (kidney, colon, and sweat glands), and require aggressive sodium supplementation to maintain electrolyte balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In children, it is most commonly caused by hemolyzed blood samples due to difficulties in obtaining or handling blood samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This is especially true in young children, in whom a hemolyzed specimen is more likely to occur because a small needle (20 to 24 gauge) and syringe are often needed to obtain blood samples as vacuum devices are difficult to use in these patients with small vessels. In some settings, an indwelling small gauged IV catheter and syringe are used for blood sampling, which also requires significant suction to obtain sufficient sample volumes. Hemolysis is six times more likely to occur when a syringe is used compared with a vacuum device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Children are also much more likely to resist phlebotomy attempts, and to cry and struggle throughout the procedure. In a child whose arm is being restrained, repetitive limb movement and contraction can lead to release of muscle cell potassium that may significantly raise the potassium content of the blood sample.</p><p>In children with marked leukocytosis or thrombocytosis, there may also be potassium loss from these cells after clotting of the blood sample. However, this is unlikely to cause significant hyperkalemia with the possible exception of patients with leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders.
