In the early 1980s, the observation that wavelengths around 311 nm were more effective than broad-spectrum UVB in clearing psoriasis led to a major advancement in phototherapy with the development of fluorescent lamps emitting selective UVB spectra in the range of 311 to 313 nm (narrowband UVB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Narrowband UVB has since become the type of phototherapy most frequently used for the treatment of psoriasis and a wide range of skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, early stages of mycosis fungoides, and pruritic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87494 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>This topic will discuss the mechanism of action, treatment protocols, indications, and adverse effects of UVB therapy.

Although nuclear DNA is the main chromophore in the skin, there is evidence that UVB also targets cytoplasm and cell membrane components, including cell surface receptors, kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Photochemical reactions convert the chromophores into photoproducts that stimulate signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of transcription factors, cytokine secretion, and a variety of cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Decreased cell proliferation, immunosuppression, and T cell apoptosis may contribute to the UVB-mediated suppression of disease activity in inflammatory and lymphoproliferative skin disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3469743\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on DNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important chromophore in the skin is nuclear DNA. The absorption of UVB by nucleotides leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine (6-4)-photoproducts, which play a key role in both UVB therapeutic effect and toxicity. </p><p>The majority of UV-induced DNA lesions are not translated into a mutation, because cells have a variety of antimutagenic mechanisms that prevent mutation formation at sites of DNA damage. The tumor suppressor gene p53 has a central role in the regulation of the cellular responses to DNA damage, which include cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>DNA lesions that are not repaired may lead to cytosine-thymine transition mutations, which represent the initial event in skin carcinogenesis, or to cell death. Severely damaged cells (&ldquo;sunburn cells&rdquo;) undergo apoptosis as the result of a &ldquo;cellular proofreading&rdquo; mechanism in which p53 erases aberrant cells through the activation of the death receptor Fas and proapoptotic effector proteins Bax (Bcl-2&ndash;associated X protein), Bak, Bid, and PUMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Apoptosis of UVB-damaged cells occurs not only in keratinocytes but also in T-cells infiltrating the dermis or epidermis.

The starting dose can be established by determining the minimal erythema dose (MED) with phototesting or by using an empirical method based upon the patient&rsquo;s skin phototype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The patient&rsquo;s MED is determined by exposing six small template areas (eg, circles of 1 cm diameter) of nonexposed skin (lower back, buttocks) to an incremental series of UVB irradiations. Increases are made by fixed values (eg, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> or by a fraction (eg, 40 percent) of the previous dose. The MED is defined as the lowest dose that causes a minimally perceptible erythema reaction 24 hours after irradiation. Sunbathing or exposure to solaria must be avoided before phototesting. </p><p>Treatment is generally started with an initial dose of UVB equal to 50 to 70 percent of the MED. It is important to document the type of lamp used for MED determination, since values obtained with broadband or narrowband sources are markedly different (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87493 \">table 3</a>). Narrowband UVB is approximately 10 times less erythemogenic than broadband UVB. Thus, MEDs determined by using narrowband UVB devices are considerably higher than those determined with broadband sources. </p><p>The determination of the initial dose based upon the patient&rsquo;s skin phototype may not reflect the actual sensitivity of a particular individual. However, this method is used for practical reasons in many phototherapy centers, particularly in the United States. The initial irradiation doses of broadband and narrowband UVB for the treatment of psoriasis recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88228 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15647452\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment initiation, frequency, and dose increments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is generally started with an initial dose equal to 70 percent of the MED for broadband UVB and 50 percent of the MED for narrowband UVB or according to the Fitzpatrick skin type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88228 \">table 4</a>). Doses are then gradually increased to the maximum tolerated dose or 2000 to 5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> whichever is lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Treatments are given two to five times per week. The duration of each treatment ranges from several seconds (at the beginning of treatment) to several minutes, depending upon the type of irradiation unit used. </p><p>Since UVB-induced erythema peaks at 24 hours after exposure, the radiation dose should not be increased on consecutive days for patients receiving more than three treatments per week. The dose increase is determined based upon the effects of the previous treatment (ie, presence and intensity of erythema). Dose increments usually vary between 10 and 40 percent of the last used dose. </p><p>The goal of dose increment is to achieve a minimally perceptible erythema, which is the clinical indicator of optimal dosimetry. As an example, in a patient receiving three treatments per week, the UVB dose can be increased by 40 percent if the patient has no evidence of erythema from the previous treatment. In contrast, if a mild erythema is noticeable, the dose increase should be limited to 20 percent of the previous dose. If a mild erythema persists even with smaller dose increments, the dose should be maintained until erythema subsides. </p><p>In a patient receiving five treatments per week, smaller dose increments should be given every other session (30 percent in the absence of erythema; 15 percent if mild erythema is noted; no increase if there is persistent erythema). </p><p>In patients who develop intense or painful erythema, irradiation is stopped until the symptoms subside and then resumed. Treatment is continued until complete remission is achieved or no further improvement can be obtained with continued phototherapy.</p><p>Guidelines for the use of narrowband UVB therapy for the treatment of psoriasis and other skin disorders have been published in Europe and in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15647413\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance therapy may prolong remission. However, the optimal maintenance schedules for specific diseases have not been determined. For the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, most therapists perform maintenance treatment for several months to a year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides&quot;, section on 'Phototherapy'</a>.)</p><p>For the treatment of psoriasis, some centers advocate a two-month maintenance phase with twice-weekly exposures for one month and once-weekly exposures for another month. The last effective UVB dose is given throughout the maintenance phase. If relapses occur during the maintenance phase, treatment frequency and UVB dose are increased until clearing is achieved. </p><p>In a small randomized trial, 46 patients with psoriasis who had achieved a 75 percent reduction of the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) after 12 weeks of narrowband UVB therapy were assigned to maintenance treatment or observation for two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

However, there is a need for larger studies with longer follow-up time to assess the risk of skin cancer among patients treated with narrowband UVB phototherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10844627\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absolute contraindications for UVB phototherapy are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Xeroderma pigmentosum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus erythematosus</p><p/><p>Relative contraindications to UVB therapy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of photosensitivity diseases (eg, chronic actinic dermatitis, solar urticaria)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of melanoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of nonmelanoma skin cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of treatment with arsenic or ionizing radiation because of the increased risk for skin cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression for organ transplant patients </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10168650\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrowband UVB (311 to 313 nm) is the type of phototherapy most frequently used for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and a wide range of skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, early stages of mycosis fungoides, and pruritic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87494 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10844492\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main cytochemical target of UVB is nuclear DNA. The UVB-induced DNA damage stimulates signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of transcription factors, cytokine secretion, immunosuppression, and a variety of cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. (See <a href=\"#H10844506\" class=\"local\">'Principles and mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices for broadband UVB therapy utilize fluorescent lamps emitting a wide range of wavelengths, mostly in the UVB range (280 to 320 nm) and, in part, in the UVA range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87492\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87492 \">figure 1</a>). Devices for narrowband UVB therapy use the TL-01 fluorescent lamps that emit UVB in the range of 311 to 313 nm. (See <a href=\"#H3364831\" class=\"local\">'Devices for broadband and narrowband UVB'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment is generally started with an initial dose of UVB equal to 50 to 70 percent of the minimal erythema dose (MED) or at a dose determined by the patient&rsquo;s phototype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88228 \">table 4</a>). It is important to document the type of lamp used for MED determination, since values obtained with broadband or narrowband sources are markedly different (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87493 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10844520\" class=\"local\">'Dosimetry and treatment protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The radiation dose is then gradually increased by 10 to 40 percent of the previous dose. The goal of dose increment is to achieve a minimally perceptible erythema, which is the clinical indicator of optimal dosimetry. Treatment is continued until complete remission is achieved or no further improvement can be obtained with continued phototherapy. The role for maintenance therapy is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H15647452\" class=\"local\">'Treatment initiation, frequency, and dose increments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common indications for UVB therapy, in particular for narrowband UVB, include moderate to severe psoriasis that is unresponsive to topical therapy, severe atopic dermatitis, and vitiligo. (See <a href=\"#H9245446\" class=\"local\">'Clinical indications for UVB therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During UVB phototherapy, the eyes must be protected with UV-blocking goggles. The face, genital area, and skin that is not involved must be protected with an SPF 50+ sunscreen or a cloth barrier. (See <a href=\"#H3470084\" class=\"local\">'Safety measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-term adverse effects of UVB phototherapy include erythema, skin dryness, pruritus, blistering, and increased frequency of recurrent herpes simplex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87496\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87496 \">table 5</a>). Long-term adverse effects include photoaging and photocarcinogenesis, although the carcinogenic potential of narrow band UVB is less established. (See <a href=\"#H10844620\" class=\"local\">'Short- and long-term adverse effects'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fischer T.
