The approach to cyanosis in the newborn is discussed separately.

It is most easily appreciated in the lips, nail beds, earlobes, mucous membranes, and locations where the skin is thin. It may be enhanced or obscured by lighting conditions and skin pigmentation. In children, life-threatening cyanosis most often results from respiratory disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two mechanisms result in cyanosis: systemic arterial oxygen desaturation and increased oxygen extraction by the tissues. Based upon these mechanisms, two types of cyanosis are described: central and peripheral. In addition, dermatologic conditions may result in blue skin color that mimics cyanosis in the absence of increased levels of deoxygenated blood in the capillary beds. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Mimics of cyanosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Central cyanosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central cyanosis is evident when systemic arterial concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood exceeds 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (3.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (oxygen saturation &le;85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-cyanosis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of note, cyanosis may not be readily detectable in patients with severe anemia (eg, Hb &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [3.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral cyanosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with peripheral cyanosis have a normal systemic arterial oxygen saturation. However, increased oxygen extraction results in a wide systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference and increased deoxygenated blood on the venous side of the capillary beds. The increased extraction of oxygen results from sluggish movement of blood through the capillary circulation. Causes include vasomotor instability, vasoconstriction caused by exposure to cold, venous obstruction, elevated venous pressure, polycythemia, and low cardiac output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE-THREATENING CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyanosis may be caused by a wide range of disorders, but it usually stems from one of several common disorders of childhood and adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82520 \">table 1</a>). Respiratory causes are most often to blame in previously healthy children with the new onset of central cyanosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-cyanosis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Vascular causes, including cardiac and pulmonary vascular etiologies, are also important etiologies of both central and peripheral cyanosis, particularly in young infants. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>Other serious conditions produce central cyanosis through disordered breathing caused by neurologic disease or decreased ability for hemoglobin to carry oxygen (eg, methemoglobinemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-cyanosis-in-children/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any condition that inhibits oxygen from reaching the alveoli or disrupts its movement across the alveolar interface can cause life-threatening cyanosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Decreased inspired oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to an environment where the concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) is decreased can lead to cyanosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-cyanosis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In children, the most common scenario is smoke inhalation from house fires. With this exposure, hypoxia from the diminished ambient FiO<sub>2</sub> is frequently compounded by toxicity from carbon monoxide exposure (which primarily affects O<sub>2</sub> delivery and to a lesser extent O<sub>2</sub> utilization), and cyanide poisoning (which primarily affects O<sub>2</sub> utilization). In addition, lower airway obstruction from smoke particles and upper airway obstruction from direct thermal injury are common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyanide poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, children experience environments with diminished FiO<sub>2</sub> through unintentional exposure to asphyxiating gases (eg, hydrogen sulfide [&quot;sewer gas&quot;], methane [common in peat bogs]) or intentional inhalation of hydrocarbons (eg, propane, butane, trichloroethane). Initial treatment consists of removal from the asphyxiating environment and immediate administration of 100 percent oxygen.

Physical findings include stridor, voice changes or aphonia, drooling, suprasternal retractions, and prolonged inspiratory time.</p><p>The initial approach to the child with severe symptoms includes a rapid assessment of respiratory function and identification of key clinical features (such as history of injury, fever, and onset of symptoms) that suggest the diagnosis and guide therapeutic interventions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54996\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54996 \">algorithm 1</a>).

This condition is often a result of major trauma (eg, motor vehicle collisions) and includes external chest compression (eg, victims of building collapse or mudslides), flail chest, open pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, or hemothorax (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79921\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79921 \">table 2</a>).

These etiologies can be broadly described as causing small airway obstruction (eg, asthma, bronchiolitis), parenchymal disease (eg, pneumonia), or disruption of oxygen exchange in the alveoli (eg, pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane disease).</p><p>The work of breathing is often increased in such patients and may be associated with retractions, nasal flaring, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> grunting.

Although most newborns with cyanotic congenital heart disease are discovered either in utero or while still in the newborn nursery, occasionally infants with cyanosis from undiagnosed CHD will present to an emergency department or a primary care office. Specifically, those infants with lesions dependent upon a patent ductus arteriosus for pulmonary blood flow (eg, coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia) can have profound cyanosis when the ductus closes, usually one to two weeks after birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103087 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-cyanosis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The hyperoxia test can help distinguish cardiac from pulmonary causes of cyanosis in some infants, but ultimately echocardiography is necessary to diagnose structural heart disease.
