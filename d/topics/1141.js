The nutrient needs are inherently high at this stage of development, to match the high rates of nutrient deposition achieved by infants in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, they often have medical conditions that increase their metabolic energy requirements, including hypotension, hypoxia, acidosis, infection, and surgery. Additional impediments to growth are physiologic immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract, including decreased gastrointestinal motility and reduced intestinal enzyme activity, and therapies such as corticosteroids.</p><p>Vigorous nutritional support is needed to correct growth restriction at birth and achieve appropriate rates of weight gain, which are almost twice that of a term infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, it is also important to avoid rapid advances in feeding, which may result in feeding intolerance or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and to recognize that excess of some nutrients may have toxic effects. Partial or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> is necessary for infants whose immaturity or medical condition precludes full enteral feeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in premature infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues related to enteral nutrition in the premature infant are reviewed here. The composition of the feeding including human milk, formula, and human milk fortifiers is discussed elsewhere.

A new international standard (INTERGROWTH 21<sup>st</sup> Century) was developed in 2014 and is increasingly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Premature infants often are unable to attain this rate. As an example, in a study of 1660 premature infants with birth weight &le;1500 g at discharge, most infants born below 29 weeks gestation had not reached the median birth weight of the reference fetus at the same postmenstrual age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, even in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), premature infants did not receive adequate nutrition to successfully grow at a rate equivalent to the reference standard for fetal growth. Continual reassessment and delivery of adequate nutritional support are imperative to optimize the growth rate for premature infants.

We attempt to keep infants growing at rates above the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile on these charts, whenever possible. The charts are helpful for monitoring growth, but equally important is the computation of the weekly rate of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Some other neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) monitor less frequently. Laboratory monitoring can be discontinued when the infant is on full feeds and the alkaline phosphatase activity is decreasing. These assessments include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone mineral status is assessed by monitoring levels of serum calcium (Ca) and phosphorus, and serum alkaline phosphatase. Infants with persistently abnormal results suggesting the possibility of rickets (low serum phosphorus and increased alkaline phosphatase activity) should be further evaluated with wrist radiographs.

There is no defined upper limit for a safe BUN, but some clinicians are concerned if the value is &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (assuming normal creatinine and urine output), which may occur in the setting of inadequate caloric input. In selected infants, such as those who are given additional protein supplements because of low BUN, the serum prealbumin (transthyretin) can be measured before and one week after the supplementation to provide a more specific index of short-term protein status. Serum albumin reflects long-term protein intake so it is usually not helpful as a marker of protein status in the NICU.

The approach depends upon the infant's maturity and clinical condition. Our general approach is outlined below, followed by sections providing the rationale. </p><p>Oral feeding should be initiated when the infant demonstrates signs of readiness, which typically occurs when the tube-fed infant is between 32 and 34 weeks gestational age. (See <a href=\"#H1929921264\" class=\"local\">'Infants who can feed orally'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3955490686\"><span class=\"h2\">Our protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our protocol for stable infants requiring tube feedings (typically &le;1800 g birth weight) is outlined here. Infants with significant feeding intolerance or other medical problems may progress more slowly. Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) should employ a similar protocol but the specifics of timing, composition, and advancement of feeds do vary. In our NICU, we use the following protocol for introducing and advancing feeds, as outlined in the table and algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109134 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109249\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109249 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beginning immediately after birth (day of life [DOL] 0), we swab the oropharyngeal mucosa with expressed colostrum about every three hours. We continue to swab the oropharynx with mother's milk until the infant is taking some feeds orally. Oropharyngeal colostrum provides immune benefits to the infant as well as an early initiation of maternal milk expression, which favors overall milk production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenteral nutrition (glucose, amino acids, calcium [Ca], vitamins, and lipids) is started as early as feasible to begin to address energy and nutrient needs. In most cases we start parenteral nutrition on DOL 1, especially for infants with very low birth weight (VLBW; &le;1500 g). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants#H2547792428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in premature infants&quot;, section on 'Early PN'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within the first few days (ideally on DOL 1), we begin trophic feeds via oropharyngeal or nasogastric tube at 15 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day; these feeds help to prime the gastrointestinal tract. Feeding is begun with unfortified human milk or 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz</span> preterm formula. Infants with an umbilical artery catheter (UAC) in place may start feeds like other infants. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Trophic feeds'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Milk strength and content'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Infants with an umbilical arterial catheter'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We advance the volume of feedings as tolerated. The rate of advancement depend upon the size, maturity, and feeding tolerance of the infant; feeding tolerance is assessed by serial monitoring of clinical criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80680 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3820436937\" class=\"local\">'Rate of volume increase'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Feeding intolerance'</a> below.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As enteral feeds are advanced, the parenteral nutrition solution is gradually decreased. Because energy needs are greater for enterally fed infants, the parenteral nutrition should not be decreased isocalorically as enteral feeds are advanced (see <a href=\"#H2006312331\" class=\"local\">'Energy requirements'</a> above). The parenteral nutrition is discontinued when the enteral feeds reach 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the infant tolerates at least 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day, the caloric density of milk is increased by adding human milk fortifier to breastmilk or switching to 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz</span> preterm formula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The target volume for feeds is 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day of fortified human milk or 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz</span> preterm formula. The target volume generally is one that supports a weight gain of more than 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Milk strength and content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A preponderance of evidence and clinical experience supports the use of full-strength milk throughout the feeding protocol and ideally human milk rather than formula. In our NICU we use full-strength milk or formula and never dilute human milk. Feeding full strength formula triggers earlier and more consistent intestinal motility responses to feeding compared with diluted formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] or water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, full enteral feeds may be achieved more rapidly using a diet of human milk compared with formula. In a study of 127 premature infants (birth weight &le;1250 g), infants fed at least 50 percent human milk achieved full enteral feeds more rapidly than those fed formula alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Trophic feeds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest early initiation of low-volume enteral feeds known as &quot;trophic&quot; feeds or &quot;gastrointestinal priming.&quot; The safety of this approach was supported by a meta-analysis, which concluded that early initiation of trophic feeds was not associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or all-cause mortality in VLBW infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A separate meta-analysis also found no safety concerns with trophic feeding, although it was unable to establish that this approach is advantageous because each study used different outcome measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The rationale for trophic feeds is that lack of enteral nutrients impairs intestinal development, manifested by diminished intestinal size and weight, atrophy of mucosa, and delayed maturation of intestinal enzymes and motility; some of these effects may be mediated by diminished production of gastrin, which is a trophic hormone for intestinal growth. In addition, lack of enteral nutrients increases intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, suggesting that it might predispose to sepsis or other infectious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].</p><p>Clinical benefits of early trophic feeding (typically defined as starting within one or two weeks of birth) in premature infants have been demonstrated in several randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/29,33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33-38</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68719\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68719 \">table 7</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Better feeding tolerance, permitting more rapid advances in feeding volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More rapid maturation of intestinal motility patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased lactase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher serum levels of gastrointestinal hormones including gastrin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and enteroglucagon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32,33</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced intestinal permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased risk of late onset sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower incidence of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater absorption of Ca and phosphorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], with lower serum alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting less osteopenia of prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]</p><p/><p>Of note, most of these studies focused on a selected population of premature neonates with particularly high risk of feeding intolerance and NEC.

These data suggest that even infants who are ill generally benefit from low-volume feeds (eg, 10 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day), provided that they do not have major cardiovascular instability (severe acidosis, hypotension, or hypoxemia). For infants who are very premature or ill, the low-volume feeds usually are continued for several days before there is any consideration of advancing the milk volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The decision to advance feedings is made after clinical feeding tolerance is proven and clinical stability is achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3820436937\"><span class=\"h2\">Rate of volume increase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Feeding protocols are important tools to support progressive advancement of feeds, combined with close monitoring of an infant's feeding tolerance, which in turn varies with the infant's age and state of health. </p><p>The details of such protocols vary among centers and the optimal rate for feeding advancement has not been established. Traditionally, most protocols advance feeds at rates of 15 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/day</span> for premature infants who are healthy and who show no signs of feeding intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In our institution, we use this cautious approach in the smallest infants but advance at rates of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/day</span> or more in infants weighing &gt;1500 grams, if tolerated (see <a href=\"#H3955490686\" class=\"local\">'Our protocol'</a> above). However, evidence suggests that more rapid advancement of feeds can be successful when used with a carefully managed protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>]. As an example, a systematic review concluded that for VLBW infants (1000 to 1500 g), advancing feeding volume by 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/day</span> (compared with 15 to 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/day)</span> does not increase the risk for NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

However, one study suggests that a more frequent feeding schedule improves feeding tolerance and reduces the time to attain full feedings. This was illustrated in a study of VLBW infants that compared every two hour- with three hour-feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Infants receiving feedings every two hours had a shorter time to reach full enteral feedings, a greater weight gain, fewer days when feedings were held, and fewer days of receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>. The magnitude of the effect was greater in infants who were less than 28 weeks gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Feeding intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to tolerate enteral feedings is a major problem for premature infants, and especially in those with gestational age below 28 weeks, who require positive pressure support, or who have positive blood cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Factors that affect feeding tolerance include intestinal motility, gastric emptying, stool output, digestive enzymes, type of milk, rapidity of feeding, volume of feeding, concentration of milk, concomitant medications, and medical conditions. An infant's intolerance of enteral feeding is a primary factor for clinical decision-making to initiate, advance, and discontinue feedings. Thus, feeding intolerance may be a major determinant of the duration of hospitalization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial assessment of feeding tolerance is important to management of enteral feeding protocols, but there are no universally agreed upon criteria on which to base this judgment.

It is an indirect measure of gastric emptying and intestinal function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathology, but is nonspecific because it may be affected by the position of infant or position of feeding tube. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In research studies, abnormal gastric residual volume has been defined as either &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per feeding <strong>or</strong> &gt;50 percent of the volume of feeds over the preceding three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Infants receiving continuous gastric milk infusions generally empty their stomachs rapidly and can be evaluated every two to four hours, similar to infants fed by the intermittent bolus technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Residual volumes vary substantially between infants and high residual volumes or emesis do not necessarily predict pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, when interpreted in the context of an individual infant's patterns, residual volumes can be useful clinically. Some premature infants have measurable gastric residual volumes before every feeding; in these infants, a moderate or large change in the residual volume should prompt a close evaluation of the abdomen. Other infants rarely have any measurable residual volume, in which case even a small residual volume might indicate a change in the feeding tolerance and should be investigated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An infant with a large gastric residual should be evaluated with the following considerations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the infant's feeding tube in the correct location? If the feeding tube is high in the esophagus or too small a caliber, then swallowed air may not be evacuated. Large amounts of swallowed air may cause gastric overdistention and displace milk resulting in emesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large residuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the body positioning affecting gastric emptying? Gastric emptying in some infants is improved by their being in the prone position or in the right lateral decubitus position as compared with the supine position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Has the medical condition worsened, such that gastric emptying is delayed due to systemic disease? This may be the first indication of a more serious problem that needs further evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The appearance of the gastric residual fluid also provides information about feeding tolerance. Gastric residuals that are green (bilious) could indicate intestinal obstruction, but more often indicate overdistention of the stomach and retrograde reflux of bile into the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A blood-tinged residual could indicate an inflammatory process, or may be due to a slight mucosal irritation from the indwelling gastric tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stool output</strong> &ndash; Stool output provides an index of intestinal motility. Some clinicians withhold the initial enteral feeding until after the immature infant has passed a stool; some clinicians use a small glycerine suppository to stimulate stool output. More rapid evacuation of meconium during the first week of life is associated with improved feeding tolerance in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood in stools</strong> &ndash; The presence of gross blood in stools is usually interpreted as a sign of feeding intolerance and should also raise concern for NEC, especially if combined with other symptoms such as abdominal distension, temperature instability, or increased apneas (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;</a>). On the other hand, occult blood in the stool is very common in infants in an NICU, and its clinical implications are unclear. As an example, in a study of 95 infants with birth weights &le;1800 g, 58 percent had at least one occult blood positive stool during the first six weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Six of the infants developed NEC; two of whom had occult blood in their stool and four of whom had no blood in their stool.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several other conditions also may cause gross or occult blood in stool and should be considered when evaluating an infant with this finding:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Swallowed blood from delivery, suctioning, intubation, gastric tubes, and breast milk from mothers with nipple trauma. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anal excoriation or fissures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Colitis due to infection or milk protein sensitivity.

In this case, the infant should be carefully reassessed and examined prior to the next feeding to aid the decision whether to resume feedings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to make changes in the regimen. Minor or isolated symptoms of feeding intolerance often can be corrected by reducing the volume of feeds or postponing advances in feeding volume. Diluting feeds is not a useful strategy. Multiple or severe symptoms usually require a full evaluation for an underlying problem such as NEC, and stopping feeds temporarily. It is important to avoid withholding feeds for prolonged periods of time because lack of enteral feeding hastens the complications of parenteral nutrition and intestinal atrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong> &ndash; Pharmacotherapy is not recommended as a strategy to manage feeding intolerance in premature infants because there is little evidence that any agent is effective for this purpose and each is associated with risks. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Acid suppressants</strong> &ndash; Histamine type 2 receptor (H2) antagonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cimetidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ranitidine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">famotidine</a>, have been used to treat preterm infants with feeding intolerance; however, H2 antagonists appear to be associated with higher rates of NEC. As a result, these agents should not be used to treat feeding intolerance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Erythromycin</a> &ndash; Evidence does not support the use of erythromycin for treatment of feeding intolerance in preterm infants.

As an example, a meta-analysis that included 10 randomized studies found no overall evidence of efficacy, except perhaps for higher treatment doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Moreover, there are reports of an association between early use of this drug (in the first month) and the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Tube feeding varies by method (continuous versus intermittent bolus feeds) and by route (orogastric, nasogastric, transpyloric, or gastrostomy).</p><p/><p>The device used for tube feeding also depends on the duration of the proposed therapy. For infants who are tube-fed only because of their prematurity, a temporary orogastric or nasogastric tube is used because they will eventually be able to suckle. Infants with major congenital anomalies may require a semipermanent gastrostomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Bolus versus continuous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most premature infants can and should be fed with bolus (intermittent) feeds. The bolus feeding method mimics the typical feeding routine of term infants and children and stimulates greater hormonal responses than continuous infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The bolus technique also has practical advantages because it does not require an infusion pump. </p><p>The continuous feeding technique may be useful for infants with underlying gastrointestinal disease, in whom it has been associated with increased nutrient absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Continuous feeds are also prudent for infants who are fed via the transpyloric route (to avoid &quot;dumping syndrome,&quot; which is seen in older individuals when formula enters rapidly into the jejunum), and for those who have had intestinal surgery. An alternative option is increase the duration of time that bolus feedings are administered (ie, slow bolus feeds). In a small group of infants who appeared intolerant to bolus feedings, duodenal motility and gastric emptying appeared to improve following the lengthening of the bolus feeding from 30 min to up to 2 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Studies comparing bolus with continuous feeds in infants without underlying gastrointestinal disease generally show no nutritional advantage of either technique. This was illustrated in a review of seven trials involving 511 premature infants with birth weights &le;1500 g that compared continuous versus intermittent bolus feeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Overall, there was no difference in the time to achieve full enteral feeds or regain birth weight, or in growth rates or days to discharge, except that a subgroup analysis suggested a slight possible advantage of continuous feeds on growth rate for infants &le;1000 g. In addition, there was no difference in the rate of NEC. However, it is difficult to make universal recommendations based upon this review because of the small sample sizes, methodological limitations, inconsistencies in controlling variables, and the conflicting results of the studies that were included.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastric versus transpyloric</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most premature infants can and should be given gastric rather than transpyloric feeds. Transpyloric feeding is used in some institutions for selected infants with persistent gastric residuals or emesis in the absence of obvious intestinal pathology, but selection of infants for transpyloric feeds varies among institutions and clinicians.</p><p>The potential benefits and risks of transpyloric feeds were evaluated in a systematic review of nine trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of short-term growth (ie, weight, length, head circumference, and skinfold thickness) between transpyloric versus intragastric feeds. Although there was an increased risk of gastrointestinal disturbance and mortality associated with the transpyloric approach, this may have been due to selection bias, with allocation of the less mature and sicker infants to transpyloric feeds. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events including NEC, intestinal perforation, and aspiration pneumonia. The authors concluded that there was no benefit to the routine use of transpyloric feeding in preterm infants, while acknowledging methodologic weaknesses in all of the included trials. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants with an umbilical arterial catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There appears to be no increased risk of enteral feeding while an umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) is in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. As long as the UAC is functioning properly, enteral feeds can be initiated and advanced as for infants without a UAC.

In our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), we use the following protocol for introducing and advancing feeds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109134 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109249\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109249 \">algorithm 1</a>), which varies depending on the size and maturity of the infant (see <a href=\"#H3955490686\" class=\"local\">'Our protocol'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Expressed colostrum or breast milk is swabbed onto the oropharyngeal mucosa, starting after birth and continuing until the infant is taking some feeds orally. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Parenteral nutrition solutions (glucose, amino acids, calcium [Ca], vitamins, and lipids) are started as early as feasible and gradually decreased as enteral feeds increase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants#H2547792428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in premature infants&quot;, section on 'Early PN'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trophic feeds are given at 15 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day, starting within a few days after birth, using unfortified human milk or 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz</span> preterm formula. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Milk strength and content'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Trophic feeds'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The volume of feedings is advanced by 15 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day as tolerated. When the infant tolerates at least 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day, the caloric density of the feed is increased to 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz</span> by adding fortifier to breastmilk or switching to 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz</span> preterm formula. The feeding volumes and rate of advancement depend upon the size, maturity, and feeding tolerance of the infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80680 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3820436937\" class=\"local\">'Rate of volume increase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The target volume for feeds is 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day of fortified human milk or 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz</span> preterm formula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110683 \">table 8</a>). The target volume generally is one that supports a weight gain of more than 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there are no universally agreed upon criteria to judge feeding intolerance in premature infants, we use the following clinical criteria (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Feeding intolerance'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Emesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Volume of gastric residual fluid aspirate, and presence of bile or blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Changes in stool output and presence of blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal distention, tenderness, and bowel sounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased episodes of apnea and bradycardia, diminished oxygen saturation, or lethargy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most clinicians use a composite of the above criteria as opposed to a single factor to determine feeding intolerance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80680 \">table 6</a>). When present, these parameters should prompt the clinician to reassess the infant to evaluate the possibility of feeding intolerance. On occasion, the clinician may choose to withhold feedings because of one or more of the above signs. Careful assessment and examination prior to the next feeding generally aid the decision whether to resume feedings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to make changes in the regime.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral feeding should be initiated as soon as the infant demonstrates signs of readiness, which typically occurs when the tube-fed infant is between 32 and 34 weeks gestational age. Although there is some variability, most preterm infants born at &gt;34 weeks gestation do not require a prolonged period of tube feeding, and many can be completely fed orally from birth. In this case, we feed breastmilk or premature infant formula if breastmilk is not available. Milk fortifier or concentrated formula (24 <span class=\"nowrap\">cal/oz)</span> are added if necessary for infants with fluid restrictions or poor growth, or for those with biochemical abnormalities suggesting suboptimal bone health. (See <a href=\"#H1929921264\" class=\"local\">'Infants who can feed orally'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hay WW Jr, Lucas A, Heird WC, et al.
