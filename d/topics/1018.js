There are different causes of diarrhea. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea can happen when people are taking or have just finished taking certain antibiotic medicines. Most often, this type of diarrhea is caused by an infection with bacteria called &quot;C. difficile.&quot; C. difficile normally lives in the intestines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). When people are on antibiotics, the C. difficile in their intestines can overgrow.</p><p>People can get antibiotic-associated diarrhea even if they don't take antibiotics. They can get C. difficile infection if they touch infected people or surfaces and then don't wash their hands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21736758\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watery diarrhea (3 or more bowel movements for 2 or more days)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild belly cramps</p><p/><p>People can also have more severe symptoms, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or pus in their bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain, nausea, or loss of appetite</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dehydration &ndash; This is when the body loses too much water. It can cause people to have dark yellow urine and feel thirsty, tired, dizzy, or confused.</p><p/><p>Sometimes people have C. difficile infection but don't have any symptoms. These people can still spread the infection to others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21736765\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for antibiotic-associated diarrhea?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can test you for C. difficile infection by doing tests on a sample of your bowel movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21736772\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help yourself get better, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink a lot of liquids that have water, salt, and sugar. Good choices are water mixed with juice, flavored soda, and soup broth. If you are drinking enough, your urine will be light yellow or almost clear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to eat a little food. Good choices are potatoes, noodles, rice, oatmeal, crackers, bananas, soup, and boiled vegetables.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor if you should take &quot;probiotics.&quot; Probiotics are bacteria that are good for the intestines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21736779\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many runny or watery bowel movements in a day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or pus in your diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe belly pain or a swollen belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea</p><p/><p>You should also see your doctor or nurse if you have any of the symptoms of dehydration listed above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21736786\"><span class=\"h1\">How is antibiotic-associated diarrhea treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are taking an antibiotic that could be causing your diarrhea, your doctor will stop it. He or she might switch you to another antibiotic.</p><p>He or she will also treat your C. difficile infection with medicines. If your symptoms are severe, you might need to be treated in the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21736793\"><span class=\"h1\">Can antibiotic-associated diarrhea be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. To help reduce your chances of catching or spreading C. difficile infection, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after you use the bathroom and before you eat. Do not rely on alcohol-based hand rubs, because they have not been proven to prevent the spread of C. difficile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow the rules about washing hands and wearing gloves if you visit someone in the hospital who has C. difficile infection.</p><p/><p>If you have C. difficile, your doctors and nurses will wear special hospital gowns and gloves when they are in your room. This is to prevent passing the infection on to other patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21736800\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my diarrhea comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your diarrhea comes back after treatment, let your doctor or nurse know. He or she will probably use medicines to treat it again. But you might need to take the medicines for longer.</p><p>You might also have heard of a treatment called &quot;fecal transplant.&quot; This involves transplanting bowel movements (called &quot;feces&quot;) from a healthy person into your intestine. It is often done in the hospital or doctor's office. This might be an option if your diarrhea keeps coming back and medicines don't help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21736807\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotic-associated-diarrhea-caused-by-clostridium-difficile-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)</a> </p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
