It also protects the body against bloodstream infection by removing bacteria from the blood. If the spleen is surgically removed or does not work correctly, a minor infection can potentially develop into a life-threatening infection known as sepsis. Fortunately, treatments to prevent minor infections from becoming life-threatening can be effective when taken as soon as symptoms appear.</p><p>This topic reviews how the spleen works, why it might be removed or not function correctly, and ways to prevent serious infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS THE SPLEEN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spleen is an organ located in the upper left side of the abdomen that filters bacteria from the bloodstream and is important for fighting infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61816\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61816 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Reasons the spleen may be removed or not function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spleen may be surgically removed for a number of reasons, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spleen has been damaged by an injury, accident, or abdominal surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To treat an underlying medical condition such as thrombocytopenia (low platelet levels), certain leukemias, or lymphomas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overactivity of the spleen</p><p/><p>In other cases, the spleen may not work properly due to an underlying condition such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sickle cell disease or another inherited blood disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease or conditions in which there are abnormalities in the breakdown of red blood cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collagen vascular diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (rare)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of the spleen at birth (rare)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS SEPSIS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sepsis is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition in which infection-causing bacteria spread throughout the bloodstream <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tissues and impair normal body functions. In people whose spleen is removed or does not function properly, the most common cause of sepsis is infection with a bacterium called <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, also known as the pneumococcus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Less commonly, sepsis develops as a result of infection with other bacteria, such as <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> or <em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>type B (Hib). <em>N. meningitidis</em> and Hib were previously common causes of meningitis and other serious infections in children before vaccines to prevent these infections became available. Hib can also cause upper respiratory tract infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms of sepsis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In people without a spleen or with abnormal spleen function, symptoms of sepsis may develop quickly following a minor infection, such as a respiratory tract infection. Early symptoms of a respiratory infection can include throat or chest pain, coughing, ear pain, or sinus pain and congestion, sometimes accompanied initially by low-grade fever.</p><p>In other cases, sepsis develops abruptly without any early symptoms. Symptoms can become severe quickly. People without a functional spleen should begin antibiotic treatment and seek medical care at the earliest sign or symptom of sepsis (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics for fever'</a> below), including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever greater than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncontrollable chills <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shivering</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drowsiness, confusion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disorientation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pinpoint purplish red spots on the skin (petechiae) or larger bluish bruises</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting (syncope)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid heart rate</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of sepsis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the spleen stops working normally or is surgically removed, the body&rsquo;s immune system can usually compensate. However, there is a small but significant risk of sepsis.</p><p>The risk of sepsis is highest in the following groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children whose spleens are removed during infancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with lymphoma who are treated with splenectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy</p><p/><p>Sepsis can also develop in otherwise healthy adults who have had their spleen removed, particularly in the first few years following splenectomy. The lifetime risk of sepsis after splenectomy is about 1 to 2 percent.</p><p>Fortunately, taking certain precautions can reduce the risk of developing sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Preventing sepsis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTING SEPSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All people without a functional spleen are advised to take certain precautions to help reduce the risk of developing sepsis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inform healthcare providers</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inform all doctors, dentists, and other members of the healthcare team that the spleen has been removed or does not function properly, especially when seeing new providers in an urgent care setting or emergency ward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carry a patient identification card, a Medic Alert bracelet or necklace, or other medical identification indicating that the spleen has been removed or does not work properly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts recommend that people without a functional spleen have certain vaccinations to reduce the risk of sepsis. Although these vaccines do not prevent all infections with pneumococcus, <em>H. influenzae</em> type B (Hib), and meningococcus, they can protect most people and reduce the severity of infection in others. When possible, vaccines should be given at least two weeks before planned surgical removal of the spleen. The vaccine should be given 14 or more days after emergency removal of the spleen (eg, due to trauma). The following recommendations are intended for people in the United States without a functional spleen; recommendations in other countries may differ:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumococcal vaccine &ndash; Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for all people who do not have a functional spleen. Two types of pneumococcal vaccines are available, PPSV23 and PCV13. Young children receive PCV13 as part of their routine infant immunizations. PCV13 is also recommended for adults who do not have a functional spleen. In addition, PPSV23 is recommended for adults and children &ge;2 years who do not have a functional spleen. When possible, PPSV23 is given at least eight weeks after PCV13 immunization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hib vaccine &ndash; Most adults have been exposed to Hib and are therefore immune. However, because there is a small risk that the person is not immune, experts advise people without a functional spleen to have the Hib vaccine if it was not given previously (it became available in the United States in 1988). If a person is unsure if the vaccine was given during childhood, a blood test can be done to determine if he or she is immune. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningococcal vaccine &ndash; A meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4; Menactra or Menveo) and a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (Trumenba or Bexsero) are recommended for people without a functional spleen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza vaccine &ndash; Influenza (the flu), a highly contagious viral infection, is a common cause of pneumonia and other bacterial infections. Therefore, a once-yearly influenza vaccination (usually given in the fall) is recommended for people without a functional spleen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Booster vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional (&quot;booster&quot;) doses of the pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines may be recommended to help maintain immunity. The need for a booster depends upon the individual's situation and the type of vaccine previously given. A booster dose of the Hib vaccine is not routinely needed but is occasionally given to those who do not develop a good antibody response to the vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventive antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are recommended in some people without a functional spleen to reduce the risk of developing sepsis. Two approaches are common:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily preventive antibiotic therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic therapy for fever when needed</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Daily therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taking an antibiotic on a daily basis can significantly reduce the risk of infection and death, especially in children who have undergone splenectomy. Children with sickle cell anemia who have impaired spleen function may also benefit from daily antibiotic treatment. Because the risk of sepsis is low in adults, the value of daily antibiotic treatment for adults is debated.</p><p>The ideal duration of daily therapy for children remains unclear. Many experts advise treatment of children for three to five years after splenectomy (or until adulthood).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics for fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People without a functional spleen are usually advised to keep a full course of antibiotics on hand in case of illness. The antibiotic should be taken at the first sign of infection, such as fever, chills, sore throat, or cough. Other signs and symptoms of infection are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms of sepsis'</a> above.)</p><p>After taking the first dose, the person should seek care <strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong> at the nearest urgent care facility to determine if further testing or treatment is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations for international travel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before traveling abroad, people without a functional spleen should consult their healthcare provider or a travel medicine center. In some cases, additional vaccinations will be recommended; one or more medications may also be prescribed to prevent or treat certain travel-related infectious diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">BABESIOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Babesiosis is a tickborne infection that is caused by a parasite. If infected with babesiosis, people without a functional spleen can develop a flu-like illness leading to potentially life-threatening complications. Treatment for babesiosis is available and is usually effective.</p><p>In the United States, most cases of babesiosis have occurred in southern New England (Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island), coastal mid-Atlantic states (New Jersey, New York), and the Midwest (Michigan, Wisconsin), particularly in the following areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coastal areas and islands off of Massachusetts, particularly Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Islands near New York City, particularly Long Island, Shelter Island, and Fire Island</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Block Island, off of Rhode Island</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal areas in Connecticut</p><p/><p>There have also been reports of infection in Maryland, Virginia, California, Washington State, Georgia, and Indiana.</p><p>Measures to avoid tick bites and steps to take after a tick bite are described in detail in a separate topic review.
