The adjusted relative risk of stroke, for example, is more than twice as high in hypertensive blacks aged 45 to 64 years as compared with similarly aged hypertensive whites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F101695\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101695 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, effective antihypertensive therapy is particularly important in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertensive-complications-in-blacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertensive complications in blacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>According to the 2010 recommendations from the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], antihypertensive therapy is recommended for blacks without target-organ damage or concomitant cardiovascular diseases at blood pressures greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">135/85</span> mmHg and, for those at higher risk, at blood pressures greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg. In addition, monotherapy is de-emphasized in favor of combination therapy. On the other hand, many authorities, including various expert panels, have not recommended initiating antihypertensive therapy at lower blood pressure goals in black patents than in other patient groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96264\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96264 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Goal blood pressure in treated hypertensive black patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of the black-white disparity in hypertension control is accounted for by lower control rates in black men as compared with white men (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F101697\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101697 \">table 3</a>). In addition to needing more widespread and effective therapy of blacks with hypertension, novel methods to enhance screening and patient education, such as that illustrated by the barber-based interventional trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], may increase hypertension control in black men and improve racial equity in hypertension control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal choice of drug or combination of drugs in black patients principally depends upon the presence or absence of comorbid conditions and the specific efficacy of the agent(s) to attain goal blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Overall, the initial choice of antihypertensive drugs in black patients is similar to that in older adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272577\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations about the choice of antihypertensive therapy are presented elsewhere. Briefly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial antihypertensive therapy usually consists of a single drug or combination of two drugs. If monotherapy is used for black hypertensive patients, we suggest a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, although a thiazide diuretic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> is a reasonable alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/3,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,9</a>]. The use of these two classes of drugs as initial antihypertensive therapy in blacks is also endorsed by the committee appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) and the European Societies of Hypertension and Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ESH/ESC)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

However, in patients with edema or other signs of hypervolemia, combination therapy with a thiazide diuretic and either an ACE inhibitor or ARB may be most effective.

In such patients, we suggest a potassium-sparing diuretic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> or a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>).

This increased efficacy of diuretics (with concurrent salt restriction) suggests an important role for volume in the genesis of hypertension in these patients; the observation that blacks have a higher frequency of salt sensitivity than whites (as defined by a rise in blood pressure with salt loading <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decline of blood pressure with salt restriction) is compatible with this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In addition to improved efficacy, the ALLHAT trial of patients with mild hypertension who were at increased risk for cardiovascular disease showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> (12.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> produced fewer cardiovascular complications than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The mean rate of change in GFR and the rate of the secondary composite end point were <strong>similar</strong> with both blood pressure goals, suggesting that the lower blood pressure goal may not provide further benefit in slowing the progression of renal failure. However, there was a nonsignificant trend favoring the lower blood pressure goal in patients with higher baseline proteinuria. This finding is consistent with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease trial, in which lower blood pressure goals were most beneficial in those excreting at least 2 to 3 grams of protein per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>With respect to the different antihypertensive agents, the following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> had significantly <strong>decreased</strong> risk of the secondary clinical composite outcome when compared with those given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> (6.9 versus 8.7 percent per year, risk reduction 22 percent, 95% CI 1 to 38 percent) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> (risk reduction 38 percent, 95% CI 14 to 56 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant differences in the slope of the GFR were not consistently observed with any of the drug group comparisons.

If monotherapy is used for black hypertension patients, we suggest a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker rather than other drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), although a thiazide diuretic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> is a reasonable alternative.

However, in patients with edema or other signs of hypervolemia, combination therapy with a thiazide diuretic and either an ACE inhibitor or ARB may be most effective.
