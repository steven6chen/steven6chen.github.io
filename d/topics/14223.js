Although nausea and emesis (vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> retching) can result from surgery or radiation therapy, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is potentially the most severe and most distressing. Significant progress has been made, but CINV remains an important adverse effect of treatment.</p><p>Three distinct types of CINV have been defined, with important implications for both prevention and management:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute emesis, which most commonly begins within one to two hours of chemotherapy and usually peaks in four to six hours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed emesis, occurring more than 24 hours after chemotherapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticipatory emesis, occurring prior to treatment as a conditioned response in patients who have developed significant nausea and vomiting during previous cycles of chemotherapy</p><p/><p>The objective of antiemetic therapy is the complete prevention of CINV, and this should be achievable in the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy, even with highly emetic agents.</p><p>Prevention and treatment of CINV in adult patients receiving cancer chemotherapy will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology of CINV is discussed separately, as are the characteristics of antiemetic drugs, and nausea and vomiting associated with radiation therapy and opioid analgesics.

Although other factors may be important, such as patient age, sex, and history of alcohol consumption, these factors are not currently used to select the antiemetic strategy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and prediction of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy agent'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting#H2082928888\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and prediction of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting&quot;, section on 'Prediction models'</a>.)</p><p>The management of CINV has been greatly facilitated by the development of classification schemes that reflect the likelihood of emesis developing following treatment with particular agents. A 1997 classification scheme gained broad acceptance and was utilized as the basis for treatment recommendations by guideline panels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A modification of this schema was proposed at the 2004 Perugia Antiemetic Consensus Guideline meeting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and is still relevant, although many more chemotherapy agents are now available. Chemotherapy agents were divided into four categories based upon the risk of emesis in the absence of antiemetic prophylaxis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Highly emetic &ndash; &gt;90 percent risk of emesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderately emetic &ndash; &gt;30 to 90 percent risk of emesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low emetogenicity &ndash; 10 to 30 percent risk of emesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimally emetic &ndash; &lt;10 percent risk of emesis</p><p/><p>This drug classification schema is utilized in both the updated antiemetic guidelines of the <a href=\"http://www.mascc.org/antiemetic-guidelines&amp;token=jFSEf/MMkMBvUbfTzXx0L06Q5rCG2E/U7YPTKw+QdedfFtau5S0D7uANOqJKFOxceOnNwnpX89/Qhw2xUIi66w==&amp;TOPIC_ID=1151\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC)/European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)</a> and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. A classification of specific agents according to their emetogenic potential is provided separately for parenteral and oral agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58756 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65923\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65923 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>For combination regimens, the emetic level is determined by identifying the most emetic agent in the combination and then assessing the relative contribution of the other agents. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> are both moderately emetogenic agents, but when given together, the regimen is highly emetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It should be noted that the studies defining the AC regimens as highly emetogenic were conducted almost exclusively in women with breast cancer. It is unclear whether AC used as a component of combination regimens in other diseases with more diverse populations (eg, doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [CHOP] in non-Hodgkin lymphoma) is also highly emetic. For example, an open-label, single-arm trial in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (75 percent receiving CHOP + <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) evaluated a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palonosetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">palonosetron</a> (0.25 mg intravenously) prior to chemotherapy, achieving an overall complete response rate of 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Many clinicians consider CHOP and related regimens to be moderately rather than highly emetogenic. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Palonosetron'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3190319902\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing the prophylactic strategy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three categories of drugs with the highest therapeutic index for the management of CINV are the type three 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) antagonists, and glucocorticoids (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68894\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68894 \">table 3</a>). In addition, more recent data have demonstrated substantial antiemetic activity for the antipsychotic medication <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> when used in combination with other antiemetics. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'5-HT3 receptor antagonists'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2991588035\" class=\"local\">'Olanzapine'</a> below.) </p><p>These agents are used alone and in specific combinations, depending on the emetogenicity of the specific chemotherapy regimen being administered and its tendency to produce not only acute but also delayed emesis. In general, most of the regimens that are associated with delayed emesis are those that are highly emetogenic, although there are some moderately emetogenic agents that also fit into this category. </p><p>An important point is that virtually all of the clinical trials evaluating CINV have focused on intravenously delivered chemotherapy. Therefore, evidenced-based guidelines for antiemetic prophylaxis with oral chemotherapy agents are not currently possible. The following recommendations, unless indicated otherwise, pertain to intravenously administered chemotherapy agents. Management of antiemetics for patients receiving oral chemotherapy is discussed below.
