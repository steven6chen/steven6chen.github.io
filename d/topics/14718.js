Anatomic and physiologic approaches to coronary artery disease are complementary and at times will yield contradictory results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coronary-artery-pressure-flow-measurements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements&quot;</a>.) As a result, quantitative approaches to the angiographic evaluation of coronary anatomy are occasionally employed in some laboratories.</p><p>There are a number of clinical applications for quantitative coronary arteriography (QCA) including predicting restenosis after angioplasty, comparing the results of different interventional techniques, and evaluating the natural history of coronary artery disease. These issues will be reviewed here, beginning with the limitations of visual and QCA, while the technical aspects of QCA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantitative coronary angiography: Technical issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS OF VISUAL CORONARY ARTERIOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for performing quantitative coronary arteriography (QCA) is based upon the limitations of visual coronary arteriography. The greatest advantage of QCA is its theoretical freedom from observer influences and bias, minimizing significant potential intraobserver and interobserver variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In prospective studies, the potential for observer error with visual analysis from a coronary angiogram has been estimated to exceed 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The extent of the variability is related in part to the severity of the lesion under scrutiny; lesser degrees of variation are reported for stenoses that represent either less than 20 percent or more than 80 percent of the vessel diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Visual analysis generally leads to overestimation of severe stenoses, and to underestimation of more modest degrees of luminal narrowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There is also significant discordance between visual estimates of luminal narrowing and the functional significance of stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The functional significance of coronary stenotic lesions is governed not only by degree of stenosis, but also by such features as the shape, length, and eccentricity of the lesion, collateral routes of perfusion, and vasomotor tone among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. These physical constraints and resultant flow characteristics contribute to the disparity between the angiographic and corresponding physiologic assessment of disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In standard cineangiography, the two-dimensional projection of the vessel onto the radiographic film poses an additional problem. Because of image foreshortening, certain segments of the coronary vessel, particularly those that deviate from a plane that is parallel to the image intensifier, will be recorded in a distorted and qualitatively inaccurate manner. This phenomenon, as well as the potential for both lesional eccentricity and overlap of vascular segments within the image, necessitates the recording of multiple angiographic projections, particularly for the more complex left coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Further difficulty is posed by compensatory vasodilatation of the normal vessel surrounding a coronary stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As a result, quantitation of the reference, normal diameter is always problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS OF QUANTITATIVE CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methods of angiographic assessment that rely upon computer-based quantitation minimize the observer variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>] and permit the theoretical prediction of pathophysiologic variables, such as pressure gradients and lesional flow resistances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p>However, quantitative coronary arteriography (QCA) shares a number of significant limitations with the standard angiographic technique since it indirectly defines the anatomy of the vascular wall through inferences about the lumen. Coronary atherosclerosis is a variable and diffuse process that may elude detection by angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/12,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21</a>], a finding confirmed by postmortem studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] and intravascular ultrasound imaging techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, the vascular features that accompany unstable ischemic syndromes and unfavorable angioplasty outcomes, such as ulceration or complex plaque morphology, are better evaluated by endovascular techniques such as intracoronary ultrasound imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and angioscopy than by quantitative angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravascular-ultrasound-optical-coherence-tomography-and-angioscopy-of-coronary-circulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and angioscopy of coronary circulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasomotion and side branches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In quantitative studies, the use of serially quantitated angiographic data may be limited by several physiologic and procedural constraints. These include variability of coronary vasomotor tone, which can influence both the lesional and the reference diameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; variability in radiographic angle and x-ray tube height; and inhomogeneity in the distribution of radiocontrast within the target vessel.</p><p>Arterial side branches that overlap the regions of interest are an additional source of difficulty, producing quantitative inaccuracies. Despite the theoretical independence of the videodensitometric technique from some of these limitations, there has not been uniform support for the comparability of pre- and post-angioplasty measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In one study, for example, changes in radiographic angulation appeared to influence the reliability of the quantitations, even with densitometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Furthermore, the phantom-imaging studies used to validate the techniques of QCA often rely on an unrealistic idealization of imaging conditions. In one study using plexiglass phantoms, imaged both inside and outside a human thorax, the more realistic radiographic backgrounds were associated with a 38 percent increase in the variability of outcome, and a systematic overestimation of the diameter of the smallest phantom within the study series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A low concentration of radiocontrast also significantly increased the tendency for error.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Correlations with functional results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perhaps the single greatest drawback of QCA is the lack of correlation between the functional predictions of angiographic disease severity and directly measured physiologic variables, as they relate to coronary flow reserve, fraction flow reserve (FFR), or the translesional gradient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coronary-artery-pressure-flow-measurements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements&quot;</a>.) Although the absolute value for minimal luminal diameter in coronary stenosis is one of the most important determinants of physiologic impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/20,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,32-34</a>], because of the numerous other factors contributing to resistance to blood flow, it should be expected that there will be differences between the anatomic and physiologic data, most often in the assessment of disease severity, especially in the intermediate ranges of angiographic stenoses.</p><p>The hemodynamic predictions derived from QCA are well-supported in animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/18,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,35</a>]. In human coronary artery disease, it has been suggested that there is a similar useful relationship between QCA findings, ie, percent diameter stenosis and minimal luminal cross-sectional area, and other predictors of altered coronary flow physiology such as coronary flow reserve and the transstenotic pressure gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/19,20,34,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,34,36,37</a>]. However, some investigators have been unable to demonstrate a correlation between percent diameter stenosis and coronary flow reserve in patients with multivessel coronary disease. In one study that used Doppler flow wire techniques, the angiographically-predicted translesional pressure gradient and the intracoronary flow velocity were simultaneously measured in 25 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. There was a lack of correlation between baseline pressure gradients, hyperemic gradients, and predicted coronary flow reserve, as measured by the two techniques. Furthermore, stenotic flow reserve was poorly correlated with measured pressure gradients and the physiologic measurements correlated poorly with the angiographically predicted minimal cross-sectional area.</p><p>In another report, the angiographic measurements of lesion severity, when verified with pressure-derived indices, were imprecise in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Nevertheless, a threshold value of less than 1.5 mm for the minimal luminal diameter was predictive of reduced fractional flow reserve in the myocardium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RESTENOSIS AFTER ANGIOPLASTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative coronary arteriography (QCA) as applied in angiographic core laboratories has become the standard technique for the study of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], directional coronary atherectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], endovascular stent placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>], and laser-assisted angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. A study comparing QCA with intracoronary ultrasound, a very precise method for assessment of the coronary lumen, found that QCA was equally accurate for post-stent assessment except when very mild restenosis occurred within a highly opaque stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Automated serial measurements permit quantitation of the reduction in minimal luminal diameter between the post-procedural angiogram and the follow-up study. In addition, the degree of balloon stretch and elastic recoil after the procedure can be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary complications of atheroablative devices&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>QCA has been used to investigate some of the mechanisms of restenosis, such as elastic recoil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], angiographic risk factors for restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], and the temporal relationships of the late loss of luminal diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. QCA has also been used to evaluate the role of pharmacologic lipid-lowering for minimizing restenosis after percutaneous balloon angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. QCA is not as sensitive as angioscopy or intracoronary ultrasound or optical coherence tomography (OCT) for the detection of intraluminal irregularities, such as dissection or new thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of angioplasty techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>QCA has been used in the studies designed to evaluate both the long-term merits and therapeutic efficacy of various endovascular techniques and devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specialized revascularization devices in the management of coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The CAVEAT-I trial, for example, was designed to compare the therapeutic benefits of directional atherectomy and standard balloon angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A similar study, CAVEAT-II, compared these two approaches in saphenous vein graft lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A core laboratory performed serial quantitative angiography over a six-month observation period in both studies. Despite a greater initial luminal gain and procedural success after atherectomy, there was no difference in six-month restenosis rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specialized revascularization devices in the management of coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.) QCA has also been used to compare PTCA alone with stenting or excimer laser angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/44,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,53</a>].</p><p>It has been postulated that the long-term angiographic outcome after intervention is determined by the immediate post-procedural angiographic result, and is independent of the device employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. To validate this hypothesis, multicenter randomized trials, utilizing core laboratory assessment of quantitative angiography, have been proposed; when completed, such studies will refine the outcome analysis of current interventional devices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another broad area of application for quantitative coronary arteriography (QCA) has been within studies designed to establish the natural history of coronary artery disease. In one report, for example, serial QCA performed over three years revealed a tendency toward mild but significant disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The angiographic severity of disease at the onset of the study was the single greatest determinant for disease progression, which occurred more rapidly in those vessels with a larger initial minimal diameter that were presumably associated with milder disease at outset. Other risk factors for rapid progression, such as an elevated serum lipoprotein(a) level, have been investigated in a similar manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>All QCA measures of disease progression obtained from serial studies, especially measurements of lesion change (percent diameter stenosis and minimum lumen diameter), are related to cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, death, and revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>QCA has also contributed to current and evolving concepts of atherosclerotic pathogenesis and disease progression. As an example, endothelial vasodilator dysfunction, which is known to accompany atherosclerosis in native and allograft vessels, can be investigated with QCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery endothelial dysfunction: Clinical aspects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A growing body of evidence derived from quantitative analysis of serial angiograms strongly supports the hypothesis that progression of established atheromatous disease can be significantly retarded, if not reversed, by aggressive lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>]; endothelial function can also be improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. These changes are associated with better patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative coronary arteriography (QCA) attempts to overcome some of the limitations of the visual estimate of the severity of coronary stenoses, particularly observer bias.
