In almost all uncomplicated pregnancies, platelet counts remain within the normal range (150,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">450,000/microL)</span>. Platelet counts may be slightly lower in women with twin compared with singleton pregnancies. Some studies have documented a statistically significant decrease of the platelet count, still within the normal range, as pregnancy progresses, which may reflect physiologic gestational changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2143458424\" class=\"local\">'Gestational thrombocytopenia (GT)'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency of maternal thrombocytopenia at delivery is generally considered to be 5 to 7 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81684 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

In a retrospective series of 199 pregnant women with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL),</span> the main causes were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational thrombocytopenia (GT) &ndash; 59 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preeclampsia with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">features/HELLP</span> syndrome &ndash; 22 percent (includes patients classified as having the HELLP syndrome [hemolysis, elevated liver function tests, and low platelets])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) &ndash; 11 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes &ndash; 8 percent (includes antiphospholipid syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dilutional thrombocytopenia, myeloproliferative neoplasm)</p><p/><p>Selected causes categorized by gestational age and platelet count are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111435 \">table 2</a>). The discussion of causes that follows is organized starting with the most common condition, GT, and ending with less common, non-pregnancy-related disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2143458424\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational thrombocytopenia (GT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gestational thrombocytopenia (GT), also called incidental thrombocytopenia of pregnancy, is a benign, self-limited condition that requires no additional evaluation or treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. GT accounts for the vast majority of all thrombocytopenias discovered during pregnancy, and almost all cases of thrombocytopenia in women with uncomplicated pregnancies. GT may occur during the first trimester, but it becomes more common as gestation progresses, with the highest frequency at the time of delivery, when the frequency is 5 to 7 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81684 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/6,9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,15</a>].</p><p>GT typically is characterized by the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most common at delivery, but can occur at any time during pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">(&ge;80,000/microL,</span> typically 100,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No increased bleeding or bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No associated abnormalities on CBC</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No fetal or neonatal thrombocytopenia</p><p/><p>GT is a diagnosis of exclusion. The diagnosis of GT is accepted if the woman has mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL),</span> especially during late pregnancy and at delivery, with no other associated findings on complete blood count (CBC) or physical examination. In our experience, platelet counts below <span class=\"nowrap\">80,000/microL</span> are extremely unlikely to be due to GT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. GT resolves postpartum, but in some women the return to a normal platelet count requires more than six weeks. A normal prepregnancy platelet count is helpful but not always available. A history of mild thrombocytopenia during a previous pregnancy supports the diagnosis of GT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>GT requires no treatment and no change of normal prenatal care and management of delivery. No diagnostic testing is necessary because a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span> causes no risk for the mother.</p><p>The mechanism(s) of GT has not been documented, but it may be assumed to be a physiologic adaptation of pregnancy, related to the increased plasma volume, pooling or consumption of platelets in the placenta, or other physiologic changes that occur in uncomplicated pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3586240276\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in approximately 1 to 3 in 10,000 pregnancies; only a subset of these have platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This is approximately 10-fold greater than the incidence of ITP in the general population, estimated to be 3 in 100,000 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The increased frequency of ITP diagnosed during pregnancy may reflect more frequent CBC testing during pregnancy and the increased incidence of autoimmune disorders in young women, and possibly unmasking of mild ITP due to the increased platelet turnover in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>ITP may occur during any trimester. The severity of thrombocytopenia is variable and may change during the pregnancy, although for many patients the platelet count remains stable. For individuals with a prior history of ITP, the platelet count may decline further during pregnancy and improve after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>As in non-pregnant individuals, the risk of bleeding is greater with platelet counts &lt;20,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL,</span> although there is no absolute platelet count threshold above which bleeding does not occur. This was illustrated in a long-term study involving 119 pregnancies in 92 women over the course of 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Most pregnancies were uneventful, but there was moderate bleeding in 21 patients (18 percent; described as epistaxis or mucous membrane bleeding) and severe bleeding in 4 patients (3 percent; described as hematuria or gastrointestinal). Most deliveries were vaginal, and one-fourth of the infants had thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"#H2154865066\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal testing'</a> below.)</p><p>ITP is an autoimmune condition in which antiplatelet autoantibodies interfere with platelet production and cause destruction of circulating platelets. However, tests for antiplatelet antibodies are neither sensitive nor specific. The diagnosis of ITP is based only on the exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia. Therefore, in a pregnant woman with mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL),</span> GT and ITP cannot be distinguished. The diagnosis of GT is much more likely than ITP in such patients because the frequency of GT is 100-fold greater than the frequency of ITP during pregnancy.

There is substantial overlap between these syndromes, but it is possible to have HELLP without hypertension (thus, by definition, the patient does not have preeclampsia) and it is also possible to have preeclampsia with severe features without all of the manifestations of HELLP. Thus, we will use the combined term &quot;preeclampsia with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">features/HELLP&quot;</span> in the following discussion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preeclampsia</strong> &ndash; Preeclampsia is a common complication of pregnancy, occurring in approximately 5 percent of pregnant women.

Preeclampsia with severe features is also associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with one or more of the following: schistocytes on the blood smear, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin; these features also raise the possibility of thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

This can lead to depletion of clotting factors and platelets, with severe bleeding as well as increased risk of thrombosis. There is always an underlying cause that initiates systemic activation of the clotting cascade. Causes of DIC in pregnancy include abruptio placentae, retained dead fetus, amniotic fluid embolism, septic abortion, and others. Patients may have severe hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diffuse oozing. There may be microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on the blood smear. Typically the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are prolonged; the fibrinogen is low, and the plasma D-dimer is elevated.</p><p>Management of DIC involves identifying and treating the underlying cause; in some cases this may require delivery (eg, retained dead fetus, abruption), whereas in others the primary treatment may involve antibiotics (eg, sepsis from a non-obstetric infection) or other therapies (eg, therapy for a malignancy). Transfusions may be needed while bleeding is being controlled.

There are several primary TMAs including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), complement-mediated TMA (C-TMA), and Shiga toxin-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS). TTP and C-TMA can be hereditary or acquired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with hereditary TTP, pregnancy confers a great risk for an acute, severe episode of TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For patients in remission from acquired, autoimmune TTP, pregnancy may also increase the risk of relapse, but the frequency is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For patients with C-TMA, pregnancy and the postpartum period are also a risk for triggering an acute episode of severe acute kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The only defining clinical features of the TMA syndromes are microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), which is inferred from the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851 \">picture 1</a>), and thrombocytopenia, which can be severe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111517 \">table 5</a>). Severe acute kidney injury is the most important presenting abnormality in patients with C-TMA. Other findings that may be present include neurologic symptoms ranging from mild headache to seizures and transient focal abnormalities. Although fever has been described as a manifestation of TTP, this was most commonly seen in the pre-plasma exchange era; fever almost always indicates a systemic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The TMA syndromes can occur during any trimester, but they are more commonly seen during late pregnancy or postpartum. Persistence or worsening of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and ongoing end-organ injury for more than three days after delivery is considered by some experts to be strongly suggestive of a TMA, since preeclampsia with severe features almost always begins to recover before this time.</p><p>Despite the overlapping clinical presentations, different TMAs have differing pathophysiologies and require different treatments. TMAs are potentially life-threatening, so it is important to make the most accurate diagnosis possible and in many cases to treat presumptively for the most serious of these while pursuing diagnostic testing.

As noted above, TTP can occur during any trimester or postpartum. In a series of 166 pregnancies complicated by TTP, the median onset was at 23 to 24 weeks of gestation, with two-thirds presenting in the first and second trimesters and one-third presenting in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of TTP relies on a thorough clinical assessment combined with a finding of ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent. As in non-pregnant patients, the clinical assessment is vital to the diagnosis, because results of ADAMTS13 activity testing often are not immediately available. In contrast to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, moderately reduced ADAMTS13 activity (eg, activity between 10 and 50 percent) can be seen in many systemic disorders and is not specific for (or indicative of) TTP. ADAMTS13 activity decreases during pregnancy, related to the increased levels of VWF, and may fall below 50 percent in many pregnant women near term (but not below 10 percent, which is typical of TTP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These issues are discussed in more detail separately.

The most important treatment is urgent plasma exchange (PEX) therapy, which removes the autoantibody to ADAMTS13 and supplies functional ADAMTS13 in the replacement plasma. For patients known to have hereditary TTP, plasma infusion is sufficient for treatment because it supplies ADAMTS13. Platelet transfusion should be reserved for treatment of severe bleeding in a patient with TTP due to the potential increased risk of thrombosis, but platelets should not be withheld in a bleeding patient due to concerns about this risk.

In a review of cases from the United Kingdom TTP registry, 10 women known to have hereditary TTP who were actively monitored and treated during pregnancy had 15 live births, and six women with acquired TTP had six pregnancies; there were no maternal or fetal deaths, and all deliveries were in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3428367896\"><span class=\"h3\">Complement-mediated TMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complement-mediated TMA (C-TMA), also called complement-mediated HUS or &quot;atypical HUS,&quot; is a disorder in which patients have increased activation of complement on endothelial cells. We avoid the term atypical HUS because it is nonspecific. Patients with dysregulated complement can develop microthrombi in small vessels throughout the vasculature; the kidney is often affected. Complement may be dysregulated because of a neutralizing autoantibody or an inherited mutation in a complement regulatory gene such as complement factor H (<em>CFH</em>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure) in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome#H179048059\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Genetic mutations'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with hereditary C-TMA have their first presentation of disease during pregnancy or postpartum. C-TMA presents very similarly to HELLP syndrome and TTP, and the differentiation among C-TMA, HELLP, and TTP can often be challenging. Key diagnostic features include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and increasing serum creatinine. ADAMTS13 activity is not severely deficient in C-TMA (activity is &ge;10 percent) and stool studies are negative for Shiga toxin-producing organisms. Often, patients with C-TMA are thought to have HELLP syndrome, but instead of improving within one to two days of delivery the patient's clinical status and renal function worsens. Limited data suggest that the platelet count is not severely decreased in C-TMA, and overt neurologic abnormalities are rare. Most patients have severe kidney injury requiring dialysis.</p><p>The clinical course of C-TMA is not affected by delivery. In fact, the postpartum period may be the time of greatest risk for the occurrence of C-TMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The most important treatment is anti-complement therapy to stop the process, and supportive care for renal failure that may include dialysis. Anti-complement therapy (eg, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a>) should be initiated promptly if C-TMA is considered the most likely diagnosis, because end-stage renal disease may occur rapidly if the process goes unchecked.

There may be a history of eating improperly prepared food or a recent outbreak, but almost all cases are sporadic. MAHA and thrombocytopenia are present and often accompanied by renal insufficiency. Fever and neurologic symptoms may also be present but are not always seen. These features are similar to those seen in children, in whom ST-HUS is much more common.</p><p>The diagnosis of ST-HUS is made based on clinical features, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and demonstration of an implicated diarrheal organism. Stool testing for Shiga toxin-secreting bacteria (eg, <em>E. coli</em> 0157:H7, <em>Shigella dysenteriae</em>) and for Shiga toxin itself should be performed. Most patients will have been tested for and found to have normal or only mildly reduced ADAMTS13 activity and normal or nonspecifically reduced complement levels.

If we are confident in the diagnosis of GT (eg, if previous pregnancies were associated with maternal thrombocytopenia that resolved after delivery), then we do not routinely obtain a neonatal platelet count. If the diagnosis of GT versus ITP is unclear, it may be reasonable to treat as ITP until further information becomes available.</p><p>The overall risk of thrombocytopenia in infants born to mothers with ITP has been estimated to be in the range of 10 to 15 percent; severe thrombocytopenia is possible but much less common. In the series of 119 pregnancies associated with maternal ITP, 31 of 109 infants (28 percent) had platelet counts below <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of these, six infants (6 percent) had counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20,000/microL,</span> five had counts between 20,000 and 50,000, and the remainder had counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL</span>. One infant had an intracerebral hemorrhage, which was not clearly due to thrombocytopenia; the infant was born at 29 weeks of a twin gestation, and the platelet count nadir was <span class=\"nowrap\">135,000/microL</span> on the day after delivery. There were two fetal deaths, one unrelated to thrombocytopenia and one a stillbirth at 27 weeks associated with extensive fetal hemorrhage and severe maternal thrombocytopenia. Smaller series have found similar rates of thrombocytopenia and similar platelet count distributions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/51-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-59</a>].</p><p>There does not appear to be a strong correlation between maternal platelet count and neonatal platelet count in ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Risk factors for neonatal thrombocytopenia include a previous history of neonatal thrombocytopenia, prior splenectomy, severe thrombocytopenia (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL)</span> at some point during the pregnancy, and possibly a maternal platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span> at the time of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/21,51,54,55,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,51,54,55,60,61</a>]. As noted above, there is no evidence that ITP therapy for the mother raises the fetal platelet count. (See <a href=\"#H3835929193\" class=\"local\">'ITP therapies'</a> above.)</p><p>When neonatal testing is performed, it should be done after delivery, typically by cord blood platelet count using clean venipuncture of a cord vessel rather than draining blood from the cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Platelet count testing by scalp blood sampling or cordocentesis is not recommended because these procedures are associated with adverse events and have not been demonstrated to improve outcomes. Percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling carries an increased risk of fetal hemorrhage that is considered to be greater than the risk of severe neonatal intracerebral hemorrhage from thrombocytopenia (approximately 2 percent versus 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/14,21,31,51,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21,31,51,62</a>]. Fetal scalp blood sampling has been abandoned because it is technically difficult and frequently results in spuriously low platelet counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy/abstract/14,16,31,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,31,51</a>].</p><p>Based on our experience, if the neonate's platelet count is low <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;150,000/microL),</span> a repeat platelet count the next day is appropriate to be confident that the platelet count is stable or increasing.
