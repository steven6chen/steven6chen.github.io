SIDS is sometimes called &quot;crib death.&quot;</p><p>SIDS happens when a baby is sleeping, usually between midnight and 6 AM. Almost all babies who die from SIDS are younger than 6 months old.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32868701\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes SIDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SIDS is more likely to happen when a baby:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeps on his or her belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeps on a soft surface, such as a bed or sofa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeps with pillows, blankets, or stuffed animals in the bed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeps in a bed or on a sofa with an adult or another child</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is too warm or wears too many clothes when sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is born to a mother who smokes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is born to a mother who is younger than 20 years old or who did not get medical care during pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is born too early or weighs less than normal at birth</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32868715\"><span class=\"h1\">Can SIDS be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no test that can tell if SIDS is going to happen. But there are things that parents can do to lower the chance that it will happen. To lower the chance of SIDS, do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always put your baby on his or her back to sleep. Do not let your baby sleep on his or her belly or side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always put your baby to sleep in a crib, cradle, or bassinet. Do not have your baby sleep in your bed with you. If you want your baby to sleep near you, put the bassinet near your bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your baby sleep on a firm surface. Your baby should never sleep on a cushion, waterbed, sofa, or other soft surface. You should also not put your baby to sleep on an air mattress, even one that is blown up all the way. Do not put your baby to sleep in a car seat except in the car.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove all pillows, stuffed animals, blankets, and other soft objects from the crib or bassinet. Do not use bumper pads on the crib.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not cover your baby's head when he or she is sleeping.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not dress your baby in too many clothes or keep the room too warm when he or she is sleeping.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking if you smoke, and do not let anyone smoke in your house or car.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeed your baby.</p><p/><p>Doctors do not recommend using devices or machines that check a baby's breathing or heart rate during sleep. Studies have shown that these do not prevent SIDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1526544\"><span class=\"h1\">How do doctors know if a death is from SIDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a baby dies, doctors and other experts try to figure out the cause in a few different ways. They talk with the parents and look around the room where the baby died. They also might do an autopsy. An autopsy is an exam that is done after death.</p><p>If the doctors find no other cause of death, then they say that the baby died from SIDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32868722\"><span class=\"h1\">Where can parents find help if SIDS happens?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse can tell you where to find help and support. It's very important for parents to get help, because a baby's death can be overwhelming. Parents can be in shock or feel anger, guilt, sadness, or fear.</p><p>Some people find it helpful to go to a support group for parents whose babies died from SIDS. There are support groups all over the world (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63630 \">table 1</a>). Other people find it helpful to talk one-on-one with a mental health professional.</p><p>If your baby died from SIDS, your other babies have a slightly higher than normal chance of dying from SIDS. Talk with your doctor or nurse about things that you can do to lower the chance that it will happen again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32868729\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
