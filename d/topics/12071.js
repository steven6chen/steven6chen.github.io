It is the most common subgroup, constituting approximately 50 percent of cases of JIA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56224 \">table 1</a>). This subgroup of JIA is further divided into persistent oligoarthritis, in which there is no additional joint involvement after the first six months of illness, and extended oligoarthritis, in which there is involvement of additional joints after the first six months such that more than four joints are ultimately affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of children with oligoarticular disease go on to have extended oligoarticular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical issues related to oligoarticular JIA are discussed in this topic review. Systemic JIA, polyarticular JIA, and psoriatic JIA are discussed separately. The epidemiology, classification, and immunopathogenesis of JIA are also discussed separately.

The peak incidence of oligoarticular JIA is in the second and third years of life. It is less common over five years of age and rarely begins after age 10 years.</p><p>The typical child with oligoarticular JIA is a toddler girl who is noticed to be limping without complaint. Often, the family notices that the child &quot;walks funny&quot; in the morning, but after a little while seems fine. In many cases, the child has never complained of pain; the family seeks medical advice only because the knee is swollen. It is unusual for the family to be able to specify exactly when the illness started.</p><p>Oligoarticular JIA affects the large joints (typically knees and ankles, sometimes also wrists and elbows, but rarely the hips). Systemic manifestations (other than uveitis) are characteristically absent. Thus, fever, rash, or other constitutional symptoms suggest a different diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The involved joints in a child with oligoarticular JIA are typically swollen and tender. Involved joints are usually warm, but erythema is characteristically absent. Young children normally have a much greater range of motion than adults. As a result, limitation of motion may not be recognized unless the involved joint is compared with the opposite side.</p><p>Several long-term complications may occur in oligoarticular JIA. The most frequent and significant complications are uveitis and leg-length discrepancy. (See <a href=\"#H5062890\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6375460\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no diagnostic laboratory tests for oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are frequently present and are associated with an increased risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">iridocyclitis/uveitis</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H5062896\" class=\"local\">'Uveitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Laboratory abnormalities other than ANAs are typically absent, including rheumatoid factor (RF) and antibodies to double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA), Sj&ouml;gren-syndrome-related antigen A (SSA or Ro), Sj&ouml;gren-syndrome-related antigen B (SSB or La), Smith (Sm), and ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is generally normal or mildly elevated. The presence of anemia or an elevated ESR or C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with an increased risk of progression to extended oligoarthritis or polyarticular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is made in the presence of arthritis in four or fewer joints during the first six months of disease after ruling out other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The onset of arthritis is usually established from the history. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with oligoarticular arthritis but an otherwise unexplained elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span> or anemia (hemoglobin &lt;11.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> fulfill the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria for a diagnosis of oligoarticular JIA. However, this subgroup is far more likely to have recurrent disease and ultimately evolve into extended oligoarticular JIA with widespread joint involvement. Particular attention should be paid to children within this subgroup since their course, prognosis, and optimal therapy appear to differ from typical oligoarticular JIA. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Course and prognosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The evaluation of the child with a limp, joint pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> joint swelling is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with a limp&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of limp in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) principally includes the other subtypes of JIA, particularly polyarticular JIA, psoriatic JIA, and spondyloarthritis (enthesitis-related JIA). There should not be any systemic complications of oligoarticular JIA other than uveitis. If there is evidence of systemic illness, the diagnosis of oligoarticular JIA is in doubt, and complete investigation to exclude malignancy, infection (particularly Lyme disease in endemic regions), or other diseases should be undertaken.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polyarticular JIA</strong> &ndash; In children less than 10 years of age, polyarticular JIA often begins similarly to oligoarticular disease, with one or two joints affected. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) is often positive on presentation in this age group. Polyarticular JIA involves five or more joints during the first six months after disease onset. In addition, joint involvement is symmetric, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), anemia, and hypergammaglobulinemia may be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psoriatic JIA</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Dactylitis (a swollen finger or toe, sometimes referred to as a sausage digit) may be present in a child with fewer than five inflamed joints, but it is more typical of psoriatic arthritis, a distinct category of JIA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA)</strong> &ndash; Children older than six years of age with arthritis involving large joints (hips or knees) and enthesopathy (pain at the insertions of muscle tendons into bones) also do not have oligoarticular JIA. Rather, these manifestations are indicative of ERA (spondyloarthropathy). Spondyloarthritis is an umbrella term for children with arthritis and varying degrees of enthesitis (inflammation where the tendons attach to the bone). Most children with spondyloarthritis are classified as having ERA, psoriatic arthritis, or undifferentiated arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spondyloarthritis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spondyloarthritis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lyme disease</strong> &ndash; Oligoarticular arthritis is one of the most common late manifestations of Lyme disease, a tickborne illness. The knee is the most commonly affected joint, but almost any joint can be affected. Typically, the large joints are preferentially affected, and less than five joints in total are involved. The knee effusion is characteristically quite large. Unlike other infectious arthritides, Lyme arthritis is not usually very painful. Diagnosis is based on serologic testing with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for screening and a Western blot for confirmatory testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal manifestations of Lyme disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease</strong> &ndash; Elevated inflammatory markers, anemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor weight gain in a child with oligoarticular disease should raise suspicion for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One-third of children with IBD develop arthritis, and the arthritis may precede the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms by months to years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pigmented villonodular synovitis</strong> &ndash; Episodic swelling of a single joint should raise suspicion for pigmented villonodular synovitis, which is inflammation and overgrowth of the synovium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It most often occurs in the large joints and is more common in males than females. Patients present with joint swelling and pain. The synovial fluid is often bloody. Pigmented villonodular synovitis can be distinguished from inflammatory arthritis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malignancy </strong>&ndash; Neoplastic diseases may present with musculoskeletal pain, but are an infrequent cause of monoarticular pain in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Both acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and neuroblastoma may present with joint pain in the same age group as oligoarticular JIA. In general, these children are in more severe pain and sicker in appearance. In addition, these entities are associated with marked periarticular pain, which is not present in oligoarticular JIA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the presentation and diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-neuroblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of neuroblastoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Radiologic evaluation may reveal bony metastases in neuroblastoma or metaphyseal rarefaction (&quot;leukemic lines&quot;) in ALL. With the exception of neoplastic cells in the peripheral smear, no single laboratory test may be relied upon for differential diagnosis. However, anemia or marked elevation of the ESR is unusual in oligoarticular JIA, but is often present in children with malignancies. Additionally, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid should raise suspicion for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other inflammatory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infectious disorders </strong>&ndash; Children with plant thorn synovitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, or tuberculosis are sometimes mistakenly diagnosed with oligoarticular JIA. These conditions may be associated with elevated acute phase reactants, acute onset of moderate to severe pain, erythema of the overlying skin, or fever that should alert the clinician to look for a diagnosis other than oligoarticular JIA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial arthritis: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Clinical features and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;, section on 'Arthritis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Initial symptoms in the hip should be regarded with great concern since oligoarticular JIA rarely begins in the hip joint. Most such patients have a different diagnosis. As an example, toxic synovitis is a transient condition that may affect the hip in young children. Other disorders to consider include Legg Calve Perthes disease, osteoid osteoma, neoplasm, or infectious diseases. In older children, ERA (spondyloarthropathy) and slipped capital femoral epiphysis may also cause symptoms beginning in the hip.

In one study, 70, 65, and 50 percent of children with oligoarticular JIA achieved an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric 30, 50, or 70 response, respectively, approximately six months after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this same cohort, 86 percent of patients with oligoarticular JIA attained inactive disease within two years, and 58 percent achieved remission within five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In comparison to children with extended oligoarthritis, those children with persistent typical oligoarthritis that involves fewer than five joints have a better chance of achieving remission. In one longitudinal study with follow-up a median of 98 months after diagnosis, 69 percent of children with persistent oligoarthritis attained remission (66 and 3 percent off and on medication, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Intra-articular injection of a joint or joints with long-acting glucocorticoids typically provides relief of symptoms within days. Treatment with NSAID monotherapy is another option for these patients. NSAIDs usually start to relieve symptoms within two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In patients who respond, NSAIDs are continued until there has been a minimum of six months of disease inactivity. A different NSAID can be tried if no response is seen within the first two weeks of therapy, or, alternatively, the patient can be treated with glucocorticoid injection. Patients who do not respond to NSAID therapy within a few weeks should be treated with glucocorticoid injection of the affected joint(s). Infectious etiologies (including tuberculosis) must be excluded prior to injecting glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The first-line approach for patients with moderate to high disease activity is intra-articular glucocorticoid injection, with NSAIDs as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,13</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a>, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), is also part of initial therapy in patients with high disease activity and risk factors for poor prognosis. Whether methotrexate should be used in patients with moderate disease activity was examined in a randomized, open-label trial of children with oligoarticular JIA and at least two swollen joints or one swollen joint (shoulder, elbow, wrist, ankle, or knee) if injected with glucocorticoid in the prior 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There was no significant difference in the proportion of children who achieved inactive disease or clinical remission by the Wallace criteria and the clinical Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (cJADAS) at 12 months between those who underwent glucocorticoid injections alone versus glucocorticoid injections plus oral methotrexate. There was, however, a significantly increased time to flare (approximately four months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.67) in those treated with glucocorticoid injections plus oral methotrexate compared with those treated with injections alone. The addition of methotrexate was not protective for the development of new-onset uveitis. Further research is needed to determine whether methotrexate should be used in patients with moderate disease activity.

In the absence of immunosuppression, routine childhood vaccines should be administered to all children with JIA, regardless of disease activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-immunizations-for-children-and-adolescents-overview#H645243885\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview&quot;, section on 'Routine schedule'</a>.)</p><p>Historically, immunizations, particularly with live-virus vaccines such as the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, have been avoided in patients with JIA for several reasons. First, there is some question about the impact of immune stimulation from immunizations on JIA, both with regards to induction of arthritis and as a cause of disease flares, although data are limited and conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. In addition, patients on immunosuppressive therapy may develop infections from live-virus vaccines and may not develop protective responses to killed vaccines. Thus, the rate of administration of the MMR vaccine is still low in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>However, no increase in JIA disease activity or medication use after MMR vaccination was seen in several observational studies, which included patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Nor were overt measles, mumps, or rubella infections reported. A normal immunologic response and no significant increase in JIA disease activity were seen in a randomized, open-label trial of MMR booster vaccination in 137 patients (131 analyzed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This study included 15 patients on biologic agents (discontinued prior to vaccination) and 60 patients on methotrexate. Sixty-five percent of patients in this study had oligoarticular JIA, and most patients had low disease activity. These findings suggest that a booster MMR vaccine can be administered to patients with oligoarticular JIA. Further studies are needed in this area, particularly regarding the safety of primary immunization with live-viral vaccines in patients with all types of JIA who have inactive disease and are not on immunosuppressants, and booster vaccination in patients who have other forms of JIA, who have moderate-to-high disease activity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who are on biologic agents.

Thus, children who are ANA positive are screened more often than those who are ANA negative.

A retrospective review of patients with JIA and uveitis from a single, Canadian tertiary center reported complications in 53 of the 142 patients with uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The most common complications were cataracts (n = 33) and synechiae (n = 31), followed by glaucoma (n = 22), band keratopathy (n = 20), and macular edema (n = 7). After a mean follow-up time of 6.9 years, 10 patients developed legal blindness in 10 eyes, and four patients developed impaired vision in six eyes. Another retrospective review found that male gender was a risk factor for a more complicated course of uveitis and poorer visual outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. However, severe disease is also seen in females.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5063469\"><span class=\"h2\">Leg-length discrepancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leg-length discrepancy is the second common complication of oligoarticular JIA. There can be significant asymmetric bony overgrowth in both length and width when a single knee joint is involved, resulting in a leg-length discrepancy over time.</p><p>Joint injection with glucocorticoids early in the course of oligoarticular JIA may prevent leg-length discrepancies. A retrospective study compared the development of leg overgrowth among a cohort of children with oligoarticular JIA who received intra-articular glucocorticoids with a similar group of patients followed at a different center who did not receive such injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Although not a randomized trial, both groups had similar clinical characteristics. None of those who received glucocorticoid injections of the knee or ankle developed a significant leg-length discrepancy or required a lift. By comparison, among those who did not receive injections, 50 percent had leg-length discrepancies, averaging approximately 1 percent of total leg length.</p><p>Leg-length discrepancies of less than 1 cm are not clinically significant and are present in up to 70 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. When they become greater, however, they are associated with gait abnormalities and increased strain on the shorter leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Proper gait can be maintained in children with mild leg-length discrepancies (1 to 2 cm) by placing an appropriate lift in the opposite shoe. An absolute discrepancy of great than 2 to 2.5 cm should prompt orthopedic evaluation for possible surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Orthopedic consultation should be obtained before the child reaches skeletal maturity. By using radiographic standards to forecast the remaining growth, it is possible to surgically close the distal tibial epiphysis in the leg that is longer and allow catch-up growth on the opposite side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. This is a minor surgical procedure (stapling) that usually has a good outcome. Similar discrepancies of bone growth may occur in other affected joints, but the knee is most common since two-thirds of longitudinal growth occurs around this joint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5063514\"><span class=\"h2\">Short stature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth retardation with short stature is seen in 11 to 36 percent of patients with persistent oligoarticular JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-70</a>]. In one series, severe growth retardation was more likely in children who required treatment with disease-modifying rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) than those who were treated with intra-articular glucocorticoid injections alone. This difference is most likely due to the latter group having milder disease, rather than any effect of the drugs. Risk factors for growth retardation included younger age at onset and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5063582\"><span class=\"h2\">Amyloidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the risk of developing secondary (AA) amyloidosis is generally small in patients with JIA, there may be an increased risk in those with extended oligoarticular disease. In one study of 215 children with various subtypes of JIA, only three (1.4 percent) developed amyloidosis, but two of these three had the extended type of oligoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Nonetheless, amyloidosis is sufficiently rare that most practicing pediatric rheumatologists report never having seen secondary amyloidosis.

These patients are subdivided into two groups. Patients with no additional joint involvement after the first six months of illness have persistent oligoarticular JIA. Those who have involvement of four or less joints during the first six months of illness, but have additional joints involved over time, resulting in five or more joints ultimately being affected, have extended oligoarticular JIA. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Course and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligoarticular JIA is the most common JIA category, constituting approximately half of cases of JIA. It is more common in females than males, and the peak incidence is two to three years of age. The typical presentation is limping without complaint. The large joints (particularly knees and ankles) are most commonly affected, but the hips are virtually never the first involved joint. Systemic manifestations other than uveitis are characteristically absent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of oligoarticular JIA is made in children with arthritis in four or less joints during the first six months of disease and in whom other causes of oligoarthritis have been excluded. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are frequently present in oligoarticular JIA and are associated with an increased risk of iridocyclitis. Patients with an otherwise unexplained elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or anemia are more likely to have recurrent disease and evolve into extended oligoarticular JIA. The differential diagnosis of oligoarticular JIA includes Lyme disease, psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pigmented villonodular synovitis, and malignancy, all of which may initially involve four or fewer joints. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrences occur in approximately one-fifth of children who initially do well. Some cases of oligoarticular disease evolve into chronic destructive arthritis. Features present during the first six months of oligoarticular illness, such as presence of symmetric disease, ankle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wrist involvement, and laboratory evidence of inflammation, are indicators of poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Course and prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H852371963\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic markers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with low to moderate disease activity, no poor prognosis risk factors, and no joint contractures are usually responsive to intra-articular glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, patients with more significant disease who do not respond to initial joint injection therapy or those with initial severe disease activity and poor prognosis risk factors require treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Biologic agents (tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors) are used in patients with severe disease or moderate disease and poor prognostic features who do not respond to nonbiologic DMARD therapy. TNF inhibitors are also used in patients with extended oligoarticular JIA and in those with uveitis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uveitis or iridocyclitis is the most serious complication, occurring in approximately one-quarter of children with oligoarticular JIA. Those who have detectable ANAs and are below six years of age at diagnosis are at the greatest risk. Uveitis is often initially silent. Thus, routine screening is necessary. Screening must be performed by an ophthalmologist and includes a complete slit lamp examination; optometric examination or office funduscopy are <strong>not</strong> adequate substitutes. Complications include cataracts, synechiae, glaucoma, band keratopathy, and macular edema. (See <a href=\"#H5062896\" class=\"local\">'Uveitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg-length discrepancy is the second common complication of oligoarticular JIA. This frequently results in bony overgrowth both in length and in width. Knee and ankle joint injection with glucocorticoids early in the course may prevent leg-length discrepancies. (See <a href=\"#H5063469\" class=\"local\">'Leg-length discrepancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383569556\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Thomas JA Lehman, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Petty RE, Southwood TR, Manners P, et al.
