The minimum requirements for performing the procedure are ovulation in the IUI cycle, patency of at least one fallopian tube, inseminate with an adequate number of motile sperm, and absence of documented or suspected active cervical, intrauterine, or pelvic infection. </p><p>Because coitus can be avoided, IUI is particularly useful in couples with some types of severe sexual dysfunction (eg, severe vaginismus, ejaculatory dysfunction) or discordant for sexually transmitted disease carriage (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis). For cervical factor or mild male factor infertility, IUI allows sperm to bypass potentially hostile cervical factors, thus increasing the number of sperm that gain access to the uterine cavity (and oocyte). For women undergoing ovulation induction, including those with unexplained infertility or minimal or mild endometriosis, pregnancy rates are thought to be higher when IUI is used as an adjunctive procedure instead of timed natural intercourse. In these couples, IUI is often used as an intermediate level and cost-effective intervention prior to proceeding to in vitro fertilization (IVF). The pregnancy rate after IUI depends on male factors, female factors, and technical factors. </p><p>Clinical use of IUI is discussed in more detail separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unexplained-infertility#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unexplained infertility&quot;, section on 'Intrauterine insemination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of infertility in women with endometriosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-assisted-reproduction-in-hiv-and-hepatitis-infected-couples\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of assisted reproduction in HIV- and hepatitis-infected couples&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-female-infertility#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for female infertility&quot;, section on 'Cervical factor infertility'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1836697\"><span class=\"h1\">SPERM COLLECTION AND PROCESSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is usually performed with fresh sperm from the woman's partner. IUI with donor sperm, which is frozen, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-insemination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor insemination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1836744\"><span class=\"h2\">Semen collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We ask men to produce a semen specimen in the morning after two or three days of sexual abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The specimen is produced by masturbation, ideally in a private room designated for this purpose in the <span class=\"nowrap\">laboratory/office</span>. The entire ejaculate is collected in a <strong>sterile</strong> cup to minimize the risk of uterine infection from contaminants. We advise avoidance of lubricants, as most are toxic to sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. If a lubricant is needed, we instruct the client to prevent contact between the lubricant and glans. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1836751\"><span class=\"h2\">Sperm processing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is critical to separate sperm in the ejaculate from prostaglandin-rich prostatic secretions and seminal fluid, which can cause uterine cramping and, rarely, anaphylaxis, when placed directly into the uterine cavity. In addition, sperm preparation maximizes the number of motile sperm for insemination, removes cellular debris, and concentrates the specimen.</p><p>Two commonly employed techniques for sperm processing are the 'swim up' method and use of 'density gradient centrifugation.' A systematic review of randomized trials comparing these two techniques did not find a statistically significant difference in pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the percentage of motile sperm recovered after processing is generally higher with density gradient centrifugation than with the swim up technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Therefore, we prefer this method in men with oligo- or asthenospermia. </p><p>We evaluate a tiny drop of the processed sample prior to insemination to ensure that an adequate number of moving sperm has been recovered. The minimum post-wash total motile sperm count for IUI is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Although pregnancies from IUI have occurred with a post-wash total motile sperm count less than 5 million, a count greater than 5 to 10 million is associated with higher pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. A count less than this warrants further evaluation and possible treatment by a urologist. If samples consistently have less than 3 to 5 million motile sperm, pregnancy rates will be less than 1 percent per cycle. In these cases, in vitro fertilization (IVF), possibly with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), is the appropriate course of treatment to overcome severe male factor infertility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING THE INSEMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The luteinizing hormone (LH) surge can be detected in serum 36 hours before ovulation and in urine 24 hours before ovulation. The oocyte can be fertilized up to 24 hours after ovulation; sperm are most capable of fertilization up to 48 hours after entering the female genital tract. Timing the intrauterine insemination (IUI) is based on these relationships. However, the optimum time for IUI is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. A 2010 systematic review of trials that evaluated the effectiveness of different synchronization methods in natural and stimulated cycles for IUI in subfertile couples concluded the choice should be based on hospital facilities, convenience for the patient, medical staff, costs and drop-out levels as no method was clearly superior to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Unstimulated cycles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Natural (unstimulated) cycle procedures are most appropriate for patients with ejaculatory dysfunction, vaginismus, or cervical factor infertility. Ovulation should be documented prior to proceeding with the unstimulated (natural) cycle IUI. The most cost-effective method is use of an over-the-counter urine ovulation predictor kit. Once the LH surge is documented in first morning urine, IUI is performed the next day. A large randomized trial showed that ovulation monitoring resulted in higher pregnancy rates than human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) triggering to time insemination in natural cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In our experience, couples are nearly always able to arrange their schedules to allow IUI timed by urinary LH monitoring. In many offices, male partners drop semen samples in the office between 7:00 and 8:30 AM, with IUI processing performed subsequently. Processed sperm can be incubated without significant loss of motility for many hours. The use of LH for timing ovulation in natural cycles actually might be the best way to maximize the probability of pregnancy for patients undergoing IUI. In a randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate with IUI, pregnancy rates were higher with urinary LH surge monitoring than with hCG-timed IUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In the United States, several types of healthcare professionals (eg, physician, nurse, nurse practitioner, etc) are permitted to perform <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bill for IUIs, but this varies from state to state as well as by country.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Stimulated cycles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is commonly used with IUI for treatment of infertility in couples with unexplained infertility. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clomiphene</a> citrate is the standard first-line therapy; if unsuccessful, the aromatase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, injectable gonadotropins, or IVF can be the next step [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Letrozole may be preferable to gonadotropins because of the lower cost, ease of use, and lower risk of multiple gestations, particularly triplet gestations or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Data on the use of aromatase inhibitors with IUI are not extensive, but suggest that letrozole yields equivalent pregnancy rates as clomiphene citrate in combination with IUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In a trial by the Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN) without IUI, letrozole was superior to clomiphene for treating anovulatory infertility in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>In four randomized trials of patients with unexplained subfertility, pregnancy rates were higher when IUI was performed in stimulated cycles than in natural cycles (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.26-3.61; 25 versus 14 percent; 26 patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate, 370 patients received gonadotropins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, another randomized trial in couples with unexplained infertility found that in vitro fertilization (IVF) resulted in the highest pregnancy rate (per cycle pregnancy rate with IVF 31 percent; per cycle pregnancy rate with <span class=\"nowrap\">clomiphene/IUI</span> and follicle-stimulating hormone <span class=\"nowrap\">[FSH]/IUI</span> cycles 8 and 10 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Urine LH testing starts on cycle day 10 to 12. Detailed instructions on when to begin LH testing are included in the ovulation predictor kits. Once an LH surge is documented in the first morning urine, IUI is performed the next day. For women who are known to be ovulatory but unable to identify the LH surge with a urine kit, we prescribe CC 100 mg for five consecutive days beginning on cycle day 3 or 5 as above, and then perform <strong>serum</strong> LH testing starting cycle day 12. </p><p>For women undergoing CC ovarian stimulation, higher pregnancy rates have been reported when IUI is performed following spontaneous ovulation as documented by LH surge compared with IUI following hCG injection to trigger ovulation. In a meta-analysis of seven studies including over 2500 women, women who received IUI after hCG injection had a 25 percent reduction in clinical pregnancy rates compared with women who had IUI after LH surge (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Additionally, follicle monitoring with ultrasound and hCG triggering of ovulation increases the patient's visit burden and cost, and therefore is rarely performed in place of CC therapy in our practice. We reserve ultrasound monitoring of the ovarian follicles for women in whom a serum LH is missed.</p><p>For women who do not tolerate or respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> and women with unexplained infertility, the aromatase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a> can be a second line option for ovarian stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Injectable gonadotropins (recombinant FSH) are given per provider dosing preference beginning on cycle day 2 or 3. It is the standard of care to follow serum estradiol levels and ovarian follicle size with transvaginal ultrasounds. When at least one follicle has a mean diameter of 15 to 18 mm, the patient self administers 5000 to 10,000 units of hCG as a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection to trigger ovulation. The minimum size (15 to 23 mm) of the leading follicle before hCG injection is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. One IUI is performed 36 hours after hCG injection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;, section on 'Gonadotropin therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The addition of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist to recombinant FSH during controlled ovarian stimulation may improve pregnancy rates by reducing the incidence of premature luteinization in women with some types of ovulatory dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Alternatively, a GnRH antagonist can be added to the controlled ovarian stimulation cycle when the lead follicle is 14 mm in size. This delays luteinization, thus allowing development of additional follicles, which is particularly useful if only one follicle has developed. Use of GnRH antagonists may also be beneficial in preventing luteinization when IUI is delayed over a weekend or holiday in practices with staffing restrictions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

In addition, when compared with double IUI, single IUI entails fewer visits and less cost and stress. &#160;</p><p>We use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain fresh or frozen ejaculate for intrauterine insemination (IUI) preparation and processing (see <a href=\"#H1836697\" class=\"local\">'Sperm collection and processing'</a> above).

Although not mandatory, consider asking women with an anteverted uterus to maintain a full bladder to facilitate straightening of the uterus. This is not useful for women with retroverted uteri.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open a 1-cc syringe and draw up approximately 0.3 to 0.5 mL of air.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attach a blunt sterile needle (eg, MONOJECT blunt cannula).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspirate the processed sperm and its suspension media into the syringe.

Two types of catheters are available: (1) relatively rigid single sheath catheters (straight or with a preformed curve) that cannot be bent and (2) double sheath catheters with an external flexible sheath that will maintain a curve and a very soft internal catheter. In a 2010 meta-analysis of six randomized trials, pregnancy and live birth rates were the same for flexible and rigid catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, other factors should be considered. We prefer a soft flexible catheter, as it can be formed to accommodate the curve of the patient's uterus and is less traumatic to the endometrium. An internal wire or rigid stylet may be used with the external sheath for difficult IUIs. If it is difficult to pass the IUI catheter through the internal os, transabdominal ultrasound guidance with the patient having a full bladder may be helpful. In our experience, patients barely feel the IUI procedure with these catheters. Stiffer catheters are easier to insert into the uterine cavity because they do not bend, but they are more uncomfortable for the patient and more traumatic to the endometrium, and thus associated with more vaginal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the speculum to obtain adequate visualization of the cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Without touching the end of the catheter that will enter the sterile uterine cavity, insert the catheter through the cervical os, through the endocervical canal, and into the uterus to a depth of approximately 6 to 6.5 cm. Try not to let the catheter touch the fundus, as this will cause cramping and, in some cases, disruption of the endometrium and bleeding, which is toxic to embryo development. If difficulty is encountered with insertion of the catheter, use of a rigid stylet or abdominal ultrasound guidance may be helpful.

We have our patients rest in supine or reverse Trendelenburg position for 10 minutes after sperm injection. Although only limited data are available on whether rest is of any value in enhancing pregnancy fertilization rates, one randomized trial reported higher pregnancy rates in rested patients compared with those who were immediately mobile post-IUI (pregnancy rate <span class=\"nowrap\">16/55</span> [25 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">4/40</span> [10 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When IUI is performed during an unstimulated (natural cycle) or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> stimulated cycle, we suggest use of an over-the-counter ovulation predictor kit to schedule the optimum time for the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Timing the insemination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild male factor, early stage endometriosis, or unexplained infertility, we suggest controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with IUI rather than natural cycle IUI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Stimulated cycles'</a> above.) Ovarian stimulation may employ <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> or gonadotropins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing IUI, we recommend a single IUI procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). When compared with double IUI, single IUI has the same efficacy with fewer visits and lower cost. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Semen processing for IUI is not difficult to learn and can be adapted to use in clinical offices, but care must be taken to ensure that adequate quality measures are in place.
