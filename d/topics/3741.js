They are an age-dependent phenomenon, occurring in 2 to 4 percent of children younger than five years of age.</p><p>Simple febrile seizures, defined as generalized seizures lasting less than 15 minutes and not recurring during a 24-hour period, represent the majority of febrile seizures. While they eventually recur in approximately one-third of children during early childhood, they are an otherwise benign phenomenon and are associated with a risk of future epilepsy that is only slightly higher than the general population. Febrile seizures that are focal, prolonged, or multiple within the first 24 hours are defined as complex. Complex febrile seizures are a more heterogeneous group, associated with a higher risk of recurrence during early childhood and an increased likelihood of future afebrile seizures.</p><p>The risk factors, clinical features, and diagnostic evaluation of febrile seizures are reviewed here. Treatment and prognosis of febrile seizures, including the risk of recurrent febrile seizure and future epilepsy, are discussed separately.

Seizures with fever in children who have suffered a previous nonfebrile seizure are excluded from this definition.

Since most simple febrile seizures last less than five minutes, a cutoff of 10 minutes has been proposed as a more appropriate threshold for distinguishing between simple and complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex febrile seizures are characterized by episodes that have a focal onset (eg, shaking limited to one limb or one side of the body), last longer than 15 minutes, or occur more than once in 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>Note that these definitions cannot be accurately applied with regard to seizure duration if treatment (eg, rectal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a>) is given after five minutes.</p><p>The distinction between simple and complex has prognostic implications, with most studies indicating that patients with complex features have a higher risk of recurrent febrile seizures and a slightly higher risk of future nonfebrile seizures.

They occur in approximately 2 to 4 percent of children younger than five years of age, with a peak incidence between 12 and 18 months. A higher prevalence has been reported in certain regions, such as Japan Mariana Islands. There is a slight male predominance, with an estimated male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340715795\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Febrile seizures are an age-dependent phenomenon, likely related to a vulnerability of the developing nervous system to the effects of fever in combination with an underlying genetic susceptibility. Aside from age, the most commonly identified risk factors include high fever, viral infection, recent immunization, and a family history of febrile seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340716550\"><span class=\"h2\">High fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maximum height of a fever, rather than the rate of rise, may be the main determinant of risk in febrile seizures. This has been demonstrated in animals and confirmed in clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In a study of 110 children with febrile seizures, the mean of 110 recordings with seizures was significantly higher than the mean of the 51 highest fevers unassociated with seizures (104.0 versus 103.3&deg;F, p&lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A key variable that modulates the impact of fever is seizure threshold, which varies by individual and with age and maturation. Seizure threshold is lower in infants and is modified by certain medications and water and electrolyte imbalances, especially hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340719519\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral infections are commonly identified in association with febrile seizures, whereas bacterial infections are infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Febrile seizures are not thought to be viral specific, but rather dependent upon the degree of temperature elevation. Viral infections associated with high fever, such as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and influenza, appear to pose the highest risk.</p><p>HHV-6 is the virus most frequently associated with febrile seizures in the United States and has been identified in one-third of all first-time febrile seizures in United States children up to two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a European study, HHV-6 was isolated in 35 percent of children with febrile seizures, adenovirus in 14 percent, respiratory syncytial virus in 11 percent, herpes simplex virus (HSV) in 9 percent, cytomegalovirus in 3 percent, and HHV-7 in 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The preponderance of HHV-6-associated febrile seizures is linked to the unusually high fevers associated with HHV-6 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The mean maximum fever in infants with primary HHV-6 infection is generally 39.5&deg;C (103&deg;F) or higher, and the incidence of febrile seizures associated with primary infection has been estimated to be as high as 36 percent in the 12- to 15-month age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This may be an overestimate of the actual risk, however, since children with milder infections were likely underrepresented in the sampled emergency department population. In one community-based cohort study in which children's saliva was tested weekly for HHV-6 DNA for the first 24 months of life, only one-third of children with a well-defined acquisition were seen by a clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Febrile seizures associated with HHV-6 have been associated with an increased rate of complex features, recurrence, and febrile status epilepticus (FSE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/14,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18-20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human herpesvirus 6 infection in children: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Acute febrile illness'</a> and <a href=\"#H864054756\" class=\"local\">'Febrile status epilepticus'</a> below.)</p><p>In Asia, influenza A virus is most commonly isolated in children with febrile seizures, accounting for 20 percent of cases in a Hong Kong study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Parainfluenza (12 percent) and adenovirus (9 percent) were also common. In a separate hospital-based case-control study, the incidence of febrile seizures in children requiring admission for a viral illness was similar with influenza, adenovirus, and parainfluenza infections (6 to 18 percent), and somewhat less common with respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus (4 to 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These viral infections were the cause of fever in children with febrile seizures, and they occurred with the same frequency in a control group of patients with fever but without seizures.</p><p>Except for the common association of HHV-6 or influenza A virus, the type of viral infection is not important in predicting future recurrence of a febrile seizure or a complex febrile seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A specific neurotropism or central nervous system (CNS)-invasive property of HHV-6 and influenza A viruses and bacterial neurotoxin (<em>Shigella dysenteriae</em>) are implicated but unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Seizure recurrence may be caused by a reactivation of the HHV-6 virus and a mild and transitory encephalitis, a theory that is an exception to the accepted definition of a febrile seizure. Multiple factors may be involved, including a proinflammatory cytokine and immune response to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340716564\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of febrile seizures is increased after administration of certain vaccines, including diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and whole-cell pertussis (DTP); and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), although the absolute risk is small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The risk varies according to vaccine preparation and age when the vaccine is administered. Genetic susceptibility may also play a role. (See <a href=\"#H340716577\" class=\"local\">'Genetic susceptibility'</a> below.)</p><p>For DTP immunization, the risk of febrile seizure is highest on the day the vaccine is administered (when fever tends to occur) and varies by preparation. DTP has been associated with an increased risk on the day of vaccination (adjusted relative risk [RR] 5.7) only, with an absolute risk estimated at 6 to 9 per 100,000 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Combination diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis (DTaP)-inactivated polio (IPV)-<em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib) vaccine has also been associated with a three- to sixfold increased risk of febrile seizure on the day of the first and second doses, although the absolute risk is small (&lt;4 per 100,000 vaccinations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. By contrast, in a cohort of more than 430,000 children who received DTaP alone, there was no increase in risk of seizures within zero to three days after vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-tetanus-and-pertussis-immunization-in-infants-and-children-0-through-6-years-of-age#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunization in infants and children 0 through 6 years of age&quot;, section on 'Adverse reactions'</a>.)</p><p>The occurrence of a febrile seizure within three days of DTP vaccination is considered a precaution to administration of subsequent doses of the vaccine, but the risk of recurrence is not well studied. Decisions about repeat vaccination should be individualized and take into account the presence of certain factors (eg, a pertussis outbreak) where the benefits of immunization outweigh the risks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-tetanus-and-pertussis-immunization-in-infants-and-children-0-through-6-years-of-age#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunization in infants and children 0 through 6 years of age&quot;, section on 'Previous reaction'</a>.)</p><p>In comparison with DTP, the risk of febrile seizures related to MMR vaccination is slightly higher and peaks later, 8 to 14 days after vaccination. The absolute risk associated with MMR vaccination was estimated at 25 to 34 per 100,000 children in one large study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among children aged 12 to 23 months, MMR-varicella (MMRV) combination vaccine is associated with an approximately twofold higher risk of febrile seizures than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65930 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Nonetheless, the absolute risk of febrile seizures with MMRV in this age group is still quite low (approximately 40 per 100,000 children).</p><p>Age at time of vaccine administration is also important. The risk of fever and seizure following a measles-containing vaccine is significantly lower when administered at age 12 to 15 months than at 16 to 23 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The second dose of <span class=\"nowrap\">MMR/MMRV,</span> administered to children between four and six years of age, has not been associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

Among first-degree relatives of children with febrile seizures, 10 to 20 percent of parents and siblings also have had or will have febrile seizures. In addition, monozygotic twins have a higher concordance rate than do dizygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], in whom the rate is similar to that of other siblings.</p><p>Susceptibility to febrile seizures has been linked to several genetic loci in different families, including the long arm of chromosome 8q13-21 (FEB1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], chromosome 19p (FEB2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], chromosome 2q23-24 (FEB3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], and other loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-45</a>]. The trait is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern with reduced penetrance or as a polygenic or multifactorial model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In one study, heterogeneous R43Q mutations of the <em>GABRG2</em> gene, located on the long arm of chromosome 5, occurred significantly more often in patients with febrile seizures than controls (36 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Family history of febrile seizures and epilepsy was significantly higher in the study group than in controls, but the homozygous mutation carrier status was not different.</p><p>In a large genome-wide association study, isolated febrile seizures were associated with common genetic variants in loci containing the sodium channel genes, <em>SCN1A</em> and <em>SCN1B,</em> among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In the same study, two loci were specifically associated with MMR-related febrile seizures, including one locus containing an interferon-stimulated gene and another correlating with the measles-specific immune response.</p><p>In some patients and families, the propensity for febrile seizures is an early manifestation of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), a genetic epilepsy for which a variety of causative mutations has been identified. Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet syndrome) is another genetic epilepsy with a well-known preponderance for seizures with fever in early childhood. (See <a href=\"#H340722567\" class=\"local\">'Genetic epilepsies with febrile seizures'</a> below.)</p><p>Hippocampal abnormalities are identified in some patients and families with febrile seizures and may be a link to genetic factors and risk of future temporal lobe epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The degree of fever associated with febrile seizures is variable and is dependent on the child's threshold convulsive temperature. While measured fever is most often at or above 39&ordm;C, approximately 25 percent of events occur when the temperature is between 38 and 39&ordm;C. Seizures are often seen as the temperature is increasing rapidly, but the degree of fever, not the rate of temperature rise, is the precipitating stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340721197\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizure characteristics</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H527240341\"><span class=\"h3\">Simple febrile seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple febrile seizures are generalized, last less than 15 minutes, and do not recur in a 24-hour period.

Although by definition the duration of a simple febrile seizure can be as long as 15 minutes, most simple febrile seizures are much shorter, with a median duration of three to four minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Children typically return to baseline quickly after a simple febrile seizure. As with nonfebrile seizures, the postictal phase can be associated with confusion or agitation and drowsiness. Prolonged drowsiness is not typical for simple febrile seizure and should prompt consideration of an alternative etiology (eg, meningitis, structural brain pathology) or ongoing seizure activity. Similarly, the presence of persistently open and deviated eyes is an important clinical feature of ongoing seizure activity.

Prolonged seizures occur in less than 10 percent and focal features in less than 5 percent of children with febrile seizures. An initial simple febrile seizure may be followed by complex seizures, but the majority of children who develop complex febrile seizures do so with their first seizure. However, an initial complex febrile seizure does not necessarily indicate that all subsequent seizures will be complex.</p><p>Transient hemiparesis following a febrile seizure (Todd paresis), usually of complex or focal type, is rare, occurring in 0.4 to 2 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/9,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,55</a>].</p><p>Children with complex febrile seizures are often younger and more likely to have abnormal development.

In the FEBSTAT cohort, the median peak temperature was 103&ordm;F (39.4&ordm;C), most patients had a defined viral or bacterial illness, and there was a higher-than-expected family history of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In another series, patients with FSE were more likely to have a family history of epilepsy than children who presented with briefer febrile seizures; they also had a higher prevalence of baseline neurologic disease and a personal history of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>By definition, FSE does not include episodes of status epilepticus in children with fever due to meningitis, but the distinction may not be possible based only on clinical features at the time of initial presentation, and lumbar puncture (LP) should be more carefully considered in patients. In one large single-center study of 381 consecutive cases of status epilepticus with fever, FSE accounted for the majority of diagnoses (82 percent), followed by known epilepsy (7.6 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">encephalitis/encephalopathy</span> (6.6 percent), and bacterial meningitis (0.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Shaking chills are usually readily distinguished from seizures. Chills are common and are characterized by fine rhythmic oscillatory movements about a joint. They rarely involve facial or respiratory muscles, which frequently occur during febrile seizures. In addition, chills usually involve both sides of the body simultaneously and are not associated with loss of consciousness, in contrast to children with generalized seizures. Thus, bilateral manifestations without apparent unconsciousness strongly suggest that the movements are not epileptic. Any repetitive movements of concern should also be evaluated by touch, since seizures should not be suppressible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340722560\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Provoked seizures from meningitis or encephalitis are the main concerns in a child presenting with fever and seizures. A thorough evaluation by an experienced clinician almost always will detect the child with meningitis. Although as many as 40 percent, particularly younger infants, who have seizures as an initial manifestation of meningitis do not have meningeal signs, they have other symptoms and findings (eg, altered consciousness, petechial rash) that strongly suggest the correct diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>It is exceedingly rare for bacterial meningitis to be detected on the basis of doing a &quot;routine&quot; evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after a simple febrile seizure. When the only indication for performing a lumbar puncture (LP) is the seizure, meningitis will be found in less than 1 percent of patients and less than one-half of these will have bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Meningitis itself has also become increasingly less common with widespread <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib) immunization practices. (See <a href=\"#H91723942\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar puncture'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with status epilepticus and fever may be more likely to have bacterial meningitis than those with a short seizure, although estimates of risk vary, and bacterial meningitis itself has become less common with widespread vaccination. In one prospective population-based cohort in England that included 95 children with status epilepticus and fever between the years 2002 and 2004, 11 children (11.6 percent) had acute bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. By contrast, the rate of bacterial meningitis was only 0.8 percent in a retrospective cohort of 381 consecutive cases of convulsive status epilepticus and fever presenting to a single tertiary care center in Japan between the years 2010 and 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition to lower rates of bacterial meningitis over time, another potential explanation for the disparity is that the former study included both in-hospital and out-of-hospital presentations, whereas the latter study included only cases presenting to the emergency department.</p><p>The emergent evaluation and management of the child with suspected meningitis is discussed separately.

Aside from typical febrile seizures, the most common phenotype of GEFS+ consists of seizures with fever in early childhood that, unlike typical febrile seizures, continue beyond six years of age or are associated with afebrile tonic-clonic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/50,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,63-65</a>]. The phenotypic spectrum is broader than initially thought and includes a small number of individuals who have only focal seizures, leading to a proposal that the syndrome be renamed genetic (rather than generalized) epilepsy with febrile seizures plus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The epilepsy typically remits by mid-adolescence but can persist into adulthood.</p><p>GEFS+ is usually associated with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. <em>SCN1B</em>, the gene encoding the sodium channel beta 1 subunit, was the first gene identified for GEFS+. Additional families have been identified with mutations in genes encoding voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and potassium channels; ligand-gated ion channels; nicotinic cholinergic receptor; various subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor; and syntaxin 1B (<em>STX1B</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/45,66-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,66-77</a>].

GEFS+ has been described as an evolving composite of many syndromes with shared genetic susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet syndrome) is a rare genetic epilepsy that can resemble complex febrile seizures in the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Mutations in <em>SCN1A</em>, encoding for the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, are identified in approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients; the majority are de novo rather than germline mutations. Patients with Dravet syndrome typically present in the first year of life with prolonged, often febrile, generalized clonic or hemiclonic seizures in the setting of normal cognitive and motor development prior to the onset of seizures. The most common precipitants for seizures in children with Dravet syndrome are <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/illness</span> and vaccination, although the first seizure is afebrile at least one-third of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Most patients have refractory seizures and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and are thereby easily distinguished from patients with febrile seizures with time.

The evaluation should focus on assessment and diagnosis of the underlying febrile illness and parent education about risk of recurrent febrile seizures and the low risk of future epilepsy.

Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the outpatient setting may help further stratify risk of future epilepsy in children with complex febrile seizures but are not usually necessary in the acute setting. The approach to outpatient evaluation of complex febrile seizures is not standardized, and a specific plan for each patient must be developed by the treating clinician, usually in consultation with a pediatric neurologist for interpretation of abnormal testing results.</p><p>Children younger than 12 months of age also warrant special consideration since signs and symptoms of meningitis may be more subtle in this age group. The threshold for performing a lumbar puncture (LP) in these patients should be lower, particularly if immunizations for <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib) or <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> are not up to date or cannot be verified.

The history should include an assessment of immunization status, personal or family history of seizure, and history of neurologic problems or developmental delay. A child with a known neurologic condition may be more likely to experience a seizure with fever, which would not be classified as a simple febrile seizure.

The presence of any of these signs should prompt consideration of an alternative etiology such as meningitis or an underlying structural abnormality. Likewise, children with febrile seizures are typically well appearing, and postictal drowsiness usually resolves within 5 to 10 minutes, depending upon the duration and type of seizure. Encephalopathy beyond this time period should prompt increased suspicion for possible CNS infection or severe systemic infection.

In a prospective cohort study of more than 100 children presenting with FSE, the median seizure duration was 72 minutes, seizures were intermittent in half of the cases, and chart reviews suggested that status epilepticus was often not recognized by the emergency department staff, perhaps contributing to the long duration of the seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures/abstract/56,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,82</a>].

A prolonged seizure, or one that has focal features, warrants an EEG and neurologic follow-up since the risk of future epilepsy (repeated afebrile seizures) is higher.

Affected patients are typically between the ages of six months and five years of age and do not have epilepsy, central nervous system (CNS) infection or inflammation, or other triggers for seizures. (See <a href=\"#H91723651\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Febrile seizures occur in 2 to 4 percent of children younger than five years of age, with a peak incidence between 12 and 18 months. Febrile seizures are an age-dependent phenomenon, likely related to a vulnerability of the developing nervous system to the effects of fever in combination with an underlying genetic susceptibility. Aside from age, the most commonly identified risk factors include high fever, viral infection, recent immunization, and a family history of febrile seizures. (See <a href=\"#H750682289\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H340715795\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of children have their febrile seizures on the first day of illness and, in some cases, it is the first manifestation that the child is ill. (See <a href=\"#H340722006\" class=\"local\">'Presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple febrile seizures are the most common and are characterized by seizures that last less than 15 minutes, have no focal features, and occur once in a 24-hour period. These are mainly generalized tonic-clonic seizures but may also be atonic or tonic in character. Complex febrile seizures are characterized by episodes that last more than 15 minutes, have focal features or postictal paresis, or occur more than once in 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H340721197\" class=\"local\">'Seizure characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of febrile seizure includes nonepileptic events or movements, CNS infection (eg, meningitis or encephalitis), and rare forms of genetic epilepsy in which seizures are particularly common with fever. While meningitis and encephalitis are the main concerns in a child presenting with fever and seizures, a thorough history and examination will almost always detect the child with meningitis. (See <a href=\"#H91723886\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Febrile seizures are a clinical diagnosis. In children with a typical history and a reassuring and nonfocal exam, diagnostic testing is unnecessary in most cases. (See <a href=\"#H91723936\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture (LP) is unnecessary in most well-appearing children who have returned to a normal baseline after a febrile seizure. Postictal drowsiness typically resolved within 5 to 10 minutes, depending upon the duration and type of seizure. LP should be performed when there are meningeal signs or symptoms or other clinical features that suggest possible meningitis or intracranial infection. Additional circumstances that warrant consideration of LP include (see <a href=\"#H91723942\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar puncture'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants between 6 and 12 months of age, if the immunization status for <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib) or <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is deficient or undetermined</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Current treatment with antibiotics since antibiotics can mask the signs and symptoms of meningitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Febrile status epilepticus (FSE)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seizures that occur after the second day of a febrile illness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing, neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) are required only in specific circumstances.
