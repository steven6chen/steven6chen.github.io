In a 2015 survey of 2225 adults, 23 percent of those with tattoos reported having had regrets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Common reasons for regret included being too young when they got it, the tattoo no longer reflects their lifestyle, the tattoo was poorly done, and the tattoo is not meaningful.

Such counseling does not address tattoos directly, but highlights internal empowerment and self-esteem, which can bolster self-worth, decision making, and confidence, which in turn may affect motivation to obtain tattoos.

The Alliance of Professional Tattooists (APT) is a nonprofit educational organization that promotes safety and provides information to tattoo artists, clients, and legislators.

The tattoo design is then drawn on the skin by hand or with a stenciling machine. Ink is applied to the design with needles that have been dipped in ink that has been poured into disposable ink cups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most commercial tattoo artists apply the ink using a handheld, electric-powered machine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109701\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109701 \">picture 1</a>). This device is held several centimeters away from the skin and has a needle bar that moves up and down between 50 to 3000 times per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Several needles may be attached to the end of the needle bar and are responsible for inserting the pigment into the skin. The number of needles produces the desired effect: a single needle creates a fine line; increasing numbers of needles create thicker lines, shading, or solid color.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The skin is repeatedly punctured using solid bore needles to allow the tattoo pigment to leach into the dermis, where it is taken up by macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The depth of the puncture varies from 1 to 4 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. During the tattooing process, blood and serosanguineous fluid seep onto the skin and are wiped away by the artist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tattoo <span class=\"nowrap\">ink/coloring</span> agents</strong> &ndash; The coloring agents of tattoo ink include inorganic metallic salts, different types of organic molecules, and organic dyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Auxiliary ingredients may be added to make the ink more suitable for tattooing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The composition of inks has changed over time; aluminum, oxygen, titanium, and carbon are more common than metallic salts such as mercury, cadmium, and cobalt, but metallic salts continue to be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/34,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,37</a>].

Among the 30 pigment samples, the most commonly identified elements were aluminum (87 percent), oxygen (73 percent), titanium (67 percent), and carbon (67 percent). The elemental analysis was usually consistent with the information supplied by the manufacturer, but there were important exceptions.

Most tattoo pigment manufacturers do not provide a description of the ingredients used in tattoo pigments, but one state (California) requires that tattoo pigments provide an itemization of ingredients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The FDA considers tattoo inks to be cosmetics and the pigments used in the inks to be color additives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. As color additives, the pigments used in the inks are subject to premarket approval under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, but the FDA generally has not exercised its authority over tattoo pigments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

These tattoos often have crude designs and are placed using primitive instruments, such as pencils, pens, or other sharp objects. The pigments could be unconventional and may incorporate available materials, such as charcoal, ink, or mascara. Adolescents may obtain amateur tattoos because they cannot find a studio that will tattoo minors or because they cannot afford to pay for a studio tattoo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H593904859\"><span class=\"h2\">Henna tattoos</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Henna-based body art is performed by temporarily applying pigment to the surface of the skin. The pigment is derived from dried powder of the plant <em>Lawsonia inermis</em>, which in its native form appears red and is commonly used for dying hair and skin in many cultures. Henna is usually applied as a paste via syringe or stylus, left on the skin or hair for 6 to 12 hours, and then washed off. Red henna is often mixed with black henna (paraphenylenediamine [PPD]) or other plant-based pigments in order to enhance the staining contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

The artist bandages the tattoo and should provide aftercare instructions, including recommending that the client cleanse the site twice daily with an antimicrobial soap and avoid contact with the site except for cleaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p>Tattoos take approximately two weeks to heal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. During this time, the risk of infection is increased. We advise patients to avoid swimming, soaking in water, and directing shower jets onto the site of the tattoo. We also advise them to avoid sun exposure, to use sunscreen if sun exposure cannot be avoided, and to wear loose clothing that will not stick to the tattoo site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110578322\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH RISKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little information is available about the incidence of complications of tattooing because they are infrequently reported to state health departments or in the medical literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].
