The adult patient with acute dyspnea presents difficult challenges in diagnosis and management. The emergency clinician must work through a wide differential diagnosis while providing appropriate initial treatment for a potentially life-threatening illness. Airway, breathing, and circulation are the emergency clinician's primary focus when beginning management of the acutely dyspneic patient. Once these are stabilized, further clinical investigation and treatment can proceed.</p><p>For the purpose of this review, we will use the term &quot;dyspnea&quot; to encompass all patients with disordered or inadequate breathing. This topic review will provide a differential diagnosis of the life-threatening and common causes of dyspnea in the adult, describe important historical and clinical findings that can help to narrow the differential diagnosis, discuss the use of common diagnostic studies, and provide recommendations for initial management and disposition. Detailed discussions of specific diagnoses are found elsewhere in the program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The respiratory system is designed to maintain homeostasis with respect to gas exchange and acid-base status. Derangements in oxygenation as well as acidemia lead to breathing discomfort. The development of dyspnea is a complex phenomenon generally involving stimulation of a variety of mechanoreceptors throughout the upper airway, lungs, and chest wall, and chemoreceptors at the carotid sinus and the medulla. The pathophysiology of dyspnea is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of dyspnea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dyspnea is a common chief complaint among patients who come to the emergency department (ED). A chief complaint of dyspnea or shortness of breath made up 3.7 million visits (2.7 percent) of the more than 136 million visits to United States EDs in 2011. Other dyspnea-related chief complaints (cough, chest discomfort) comprised 8.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In males and females over the age of 65 years old, dyspnea and related problems were a major reason for ED visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>According to one prospective observational study, the most common diagnoses among elderly patients presenting to an ED with a complaint of acute shortness of breath and manifesting signs of respiratory distress (eg, respiratory rate &gt;25, SpO2 &lt;93 percent) are decompensated heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism, and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A table listing life-threatening and common causes of dyspnea that present to the emergency department is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52926\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52926 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening upper airway causes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheal foreign objects &ndash; Common objects include food, coins, bones, dentures, medication tablets, and a multitude of other objects that can be placed in the mouth and become lodged in the upper and lower airways. This is an uncommon cause of acute dyspnea in adults.

The affected skin may be erythematous or normal in color, but is usually not pruritic. Although first described over a century ago, the pathophysiology, origin, and treatment of angioedema are not completely understood. The various types include allergic, medication-related (eg, NSAID, ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker), and complement-related (C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency or a nonfunctional allele). Patients who receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke are also at risk for developing angioedema, which tends to be hemi-lingual and contralateral to the ischemic hemisphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Epiglottitis generally presents with rapidly progressive sore throat, dysphagia, hoarseness (&quot;hot potato&quot; voice), and fever. Although once a predominately pediatric disease, epiglottitis now occurs more often in adults, in whom airway obstruction may not be a prominent symptom. Pertussis may present with severe paroxysms of cough, but can be difficult to diagnose clinically. Deep space infections of the neck, from Ludwig's angina, severe tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, and retropharyngeal abscess, can cause swelling and pain, which may manifest in part as acute dyspnea.

Suspect a larynx fracture in patients complaining of dyspnea in the setting of severe neck pain and dysphonia following blunt trauma. Patients who have sustained facial burns or smoke inhalation are at risk for rapidly progressive airway compromise and must be emergently evaluated. Early endotracheal intubation is often indicated.

Risk factors include a history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, prolonged immobilization, recent trauma or surgery (particularly orthopedic), pregnancy, malignancy, stroke or paresis, oral contraceptive or other estrogen use, smoking, and a personal or family history of hypercoagulability. Presentation varies widely, but dyspnea at rest and tachypnea are the most common signs. A large minority of patients have no known risk factor at the time of diagnosis. Other embolic phenomena include fat embolism, especially after a long bone fracture or associated with the acute chest syndrome of sickle cell disease, and amniotic fluid embolism.

Most often, a viral or bacterial respiratory infection exacerbates the patient's underlying illness. Pulmonary emboli may be responsible for up to 25 percent of apparent &quot;COPD exacerbations&quot; and should be suspected when the patient fails to improve with standard COPD treatment measures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma &ndash; Asthma exacerbations generally present with dyspnea and wheezing. Signs of severe disease include the use of accessory muscles, brief fragmented speech, profound diaphoresis, agitation, and failure to respond to aggressive treatment. Extreme fatigue, cyanosis, and depressed mental status portend imminent respiratory arrest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute exacerbations of asthma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-acute-severe-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in acute severe asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum &ndash; Any simple pneumothorax can develop into a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. In addition to trauma and medical procedures (eg, central venous catheter placement), a number of medical conditions increase the risk for developing a pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Risk factors for primary spontaneous pneumothorax include smoking, a family history, and Marfan syndrome. Patients are generally in their 20s and complain of sudden onset dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain that began at rest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with certain pulmonary diseases (including COPD, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, and AIDS patients with pneumocystis pneumonia) are at risk for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who have sustained chest trauma or who have been coughing vigorously may present with dyspnea, sharp pleuritic chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema over the supraclavicular area and anterior neck from pneumomediastinum associated with a pneumothorax</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary infection &ndash; Lung infections such as severe bronchitis or pneumonia can cause shortness of breath and hypoxia. Productive cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain are common but insensitive signs. The onset of dyspnea in these patients is generally not acute unless underlying chronic pulmonary disease is present. A chest radiograph is generally necessary for diagnosis but may be unrevealing early in the disease course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]) &ndash; ARDS can complicate a wide range of conditions and is characterized by rapidly progressive dyspnea, hypoxia, and bilateral infiltrates on plain chest radiograph. It can be difficult to distinguish from acute decompensated heart failure purely on clinical grounds. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and echocardiography can be helpful for diagnosis. Potential causes include sepsis, shock, severe trauma, toxic inhalations (aspiration, thermal injury, anhydrous ammonia, chlorine), infections (Hantavirus, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome), blood transfusion, and drug overdose (cocaine, opioids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>).

Symptoms often begin with a nonproductive cough, dyspnea on exertion and fatigue, generally between two to four days after ascending to a high altitude. This may progress quickly to dyspnea at rest. Pulmonary symptoms are often accompanied by a headache and, in the most severe cases, cerebral edema. The diagnosis of HAPE should be suspected in any patient with dyspnea who has ascended to a high altitude. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude pulmonary edema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct pulmonary injury &ndash; A pulmonary contusion or laceration is a possible source for acute dyspnea in any patient with chest trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary hemorrhage &ndash; Hemorrhage from an injury or an underlying disease (eg, malignancy, tuberculosis) can cause acute dyspnea.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening cardiac causes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) &ndash; Patients, particularly the elderly, suffering from a myocardial infarction (MI) may present with dyspnea as their sole symptom. Clinicians are more likely to miss an MI in the patient whose chief complaint is dyspnea, rather than chest pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) &ndash; Symptomatic ADHF can be caused by volume overload, HFpEF (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [previously known as &quot;diastolic dysfunction&quot;]) or HFrEF (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [previously known as &quot;systolic dysfunction]), or outflow obstruction (eg, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe systemic hypertension). Myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia are common precipitants. Symptoms range from mild dyspnea on exertion to severe pulmonary edema requiring emergent airway management. Common findings include tachypnea, pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distension, S3 gallop, and peripheral edema. ADHF is among the most common causes of acute respiratory failure among patients over 65 years.

Signs may include tachycardia, bounding pulses, a venous hum heard over the internal jugular veins, and carotid bruits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of high-output heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiomyopathy &ndash; The physiologic derangements associated with cardiomyopathy (primarily dilated cardiomyopathy) may result in pulmonary edema and manifest as dyspnea. Potential causes include cardiac ischemia, hypertension, alcohol abuse, cocaine abuse, and a number of systemic diseases (eg, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac arrhythmia &ndash; Cardiac rhythm abnormalities, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, second and third degree heart block, and tachyarrhythmias (eg, SVT and ventricular tachycardia) can result in dyspnea. Such abnormalities may stem from underlying disease, including myocardial ischemia, or cardiac decompensation due to the elevated or slowed heart rate or uncoordinated contractions.

A murmur may be appreciable, but the absence of an audible murmur does not exclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvular heart disease in elderly adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac tamponade &ndash; Whether due to trauma, malignancy, uremia, drugs, or infection, cardiac tamponade can present with acute dyspnea. The classically described findings of hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart tones suggest the diagnosis, but are often absent. The electrocardiogram generally shows sinus tachycardia and low voltage, and may uncommonly reveal electrical alternans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening neurologic causes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke &ndash; Although dyspnea is not the chief complaint of patients with an acute stroke, a number of respiratory abnormalities may result from a sufficiently severe injury or one affecting regions involved in respiration. Such abnormalities may include aspiration pneumonia, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and a number of abnormal respiratory patterns, including apnea, that can lead to severe hypoxia or hypocapnia. Invasive airway management may be required.

Organophosphate poisoning causes an increase in airway sections and bronchospasm. Petroleum distillates and paraquat can cause respiratory difficulty. Botulism may cause generalized descending muscle weakness involving the respiratory muscles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organophosphate-and-carbamate-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraquat-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraquat poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salicylate poisoning &ndash; Salicylate overdose leads to stimulation of the medullary respiratory center, initially causing hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis, followed by metabolic acidosis. In some cases, pulmonary edema may occur with severe poisoning. Prominent extrapulmonary signs include fever, tinnitus, vertigo, vomiting, diarrhea, and in more severe cases mental status changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbon monoxide poisoning &ndash; Carbon monoxide is a potentially lethal toxin that impairs oxygen transport. Carbon monoxide poisoning may present with tachypnea and acute dyspnea in moderate cases, and pulmonary edema in severe cases. Extrapulmonary signs are generally more prominent and often nonspecific. They can include headache, malaise, chest discomfort, and altered mental status. Pulse oximetry readings are unaffected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxin related metabolic acidosis &ndash; Toxic ingestions, including methanol and ethylene glycol, may cause a metabolic acidosis and compensatory tachypnea that manifest as respiratory distress and may lead to respiratory failure.

Approximately two-thirds of women experience dyspnea during the course of normal pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, pregnancy increases the risk for several potentially life-threatening conditions that may manifest with dyspnea, notably pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary edema may be identified in the setting of a number of diseases associated with pregnancy, including preeclampsia, amniotic fluid embolism, and cardiomyopathy.

Even among young healthy patients with a known anxiety disorder, it is prudent to perform a history and physical examination to screen for medical causes of dyspnea. To complicate matters, anxiety is common among patients with severe medical disease. As an example, COPD patients have a three-fold increase in the prevalence of anxiety disorders compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In such patients, it is best to assume that an exacerbation of their underlying medical disease is the cause of dyspnea, until proven otherwise.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history is critical to the evaluation of the acutely dyspneic patient, but can be difficult to obtain when the patient has difficulty speaking and the clinician must concentrate on ensuring that the patient maintains adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Relevant history can be obtained from the patient, EMS providers, family and friends, pharmacists, and primary care clinicians. The following details should be obtained whenever possible:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General historical features &ndash; Ask about the events leading up to the episode, particularly any recent symptoms or specific triggers for the acute dyspnea. As examples, noncompliance with medications or diet may lead to an episode of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), exposure to cold or an allergen may trigger an asthma flare, acute dyspnea immediately following a meal suggests an allergic reaction, a new productive cough suggests a pulmonary infection, recent surgery or immobilization increases the risk for pulmonary embolism (PE), while recent trauma may have caused a pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past history &ndash; Determine whether the problem is new or recurring. Ask about preexisting medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, or ischemic heart disease, and whether the patient has experienced similar acute episodes before. If it resembles prior episodes, the current problem is often an exacerbation of a preexisting illness. The medical record and medication list can provide important diagnostic clues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior intubation &ndash; Patients with a history of endotracheal intubation for medical conditions have a higher risk for severe disease and the need for subsequent intubation. As an example, patients who have required intubation for a severe asthma exacerbation are at increased risk for subsequent episodes of near-fatal asthma attacks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying patients at risk for fatal asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time course &ndash; Ask whether the dyspnea developed suddenly or gradually. Keep in mind that exacerbations of a single illness can present in different ways and over different periods of time. As examples, an asthma flare may develop over minutes or days, as may episodes of heart failure. A table is provided to help differentiate causes of respiratory distress based on time course (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64683 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity &ndash; When asked to grade the severity of their distress using a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = just noticeable, 3 = slight, 5 = moderate, 7 = moderately severe, 9 = very severe and 10 = panic level), patients with acute exacerbations of asthma, COPD and ADHF tend to rate their distress as moderately severe (score of 7), while those experiencing dyspnea associated with normal pregnancy, neuromuscular disorders or PE tend to rate their distress as only moderate (score of 5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain &ndash; Chest pain in association with dyspnea occurs with a number of diseases, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pneumothorax, and PE. Of note, a sizable minority of patients with ACS or PE complain of dyspnea alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with chest pain in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma &ndash; Injury to the airway, neck, chest wall, lungs, heart, mediastinal structures, or abdomen can lead to dyspnea. Acute symptoms may not manifest until a day or longer following trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; Fever can be associated with an infection, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, aspiration pneumonitis, or poisoning. As an example of the latter, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> overdose can present with fever and abnormal breathing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) &ndash; Keep in mind that PND is NOT specific for ADHF. Patients with COPD may present with a similar history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoptysis &ndash; Hemoptysis is associated with a number of diseases, including PE, tuberculosis, and malignancy, when tumors erode into a vascular structure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough and sputum &ndash; The presence and quality of sputum may be helpful. Purulent sputum suggests pneumonia and white or pink frothy sputum suggests ADHF, while frankly bloody sputum suggests infection (eg, tuberculosis) or pulmonary hemorrhage (eg, pulmonary embolism or malignancy). A nonproductive cough is a nonspecific symptom, and may be associated with asthma, heart failure, respiratory infection, or PE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications &ndash; A review of the patient's medications can prove helpful. In addition to information about chronic or acute illness (eg, recent antibiotic prescription), a medication list may provide information about recent changes in medications or dosing. It is important to ask about compliance. Obtaining information directly from the patient's pharmacy can be helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tobacco and drugs &ndash; Knowledge of the patient's tobacco and drug use can provide insight into the differential diagnosis. Tobacco use increases the risk for a number of chronic conditions (COPD, malignancy), while inhaled drug use can lead to such conditions as crack lung and ARDS. Noninhalational use or overdose of certain drugs, such as opioids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, can produce acute lung injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-disease-in-injection-drug-users\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary disease in injection drug users&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric conditions &ndash; Psychogenic causes for acute dyspnea represent diagnoses of exclusion in the emergency department. Organic causes <strong>must</strong> be thoroughly considered first. Nevertheless, among patients younger than 40 years with no medical conditions, psychogenic dyspnea (eg, anxiety attack) may be the cause in a sizable minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical danger signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emergency clinician should perform a screening physical examination looking for signs of significant respiratory distress in all patients with acute dyspnea.

They are an ominous sign suggesting extreme respiratory distress. The use of accessory muscles to breathe suggests fatigue of the respiratory muscles and suggests the potential for respiratory failure.</p><p>Diaphoresis reflects extreme sympathetic stimulation associated with severe disease (myocardial infarction, severe asthma flare). Cyanosis is uncommon and indicates severe hypoxia or methemoglobinemia.</p><p>Altered mental status (eg, agitation or somnolence) in the dyspneic patient suggests severe hypoxia or hypercarbia. It may also be caused by a toxin (eg, salicylate overdose, carbon monoxide) or underlying pathology (eg, hypoglycemia, sepsis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">General examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a screen for clinical danger signs is completed and any necessary resuscitation is initiated, a more thorough physical examination is performed. Important items to note are described below and in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76513\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76513 \">table 3</a>). Keep in mind that an unremarkable pulmonary and cardiac examination does NOT rule out significant disease. As examples, the sensitivity and specificity of the pulmonary examination are limited for making the diagnosis of pneumonia or acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory rate &ndash; Patients with serious underlying disease may have a fast, normal, or slow respiratory rate (RR). As an example, patients with a pulmonary embolism may have a RR in the normal range. Note that measurements of the respiratory rate obtained during triage may not be accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse oximetry &ndash; Pulse oximetry provides crucial information about arterial oxygenation. However, clinicians must be aware that standard pulse oximeters are NOT accurate in the setting of hypothermia, shock, carbon monoxide poisoning, and methemoglobinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, healthy individuals demonstrate an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95 percent or greater. Elders and patients who are obese or smoke heavily often maintain levels between 92 and 95 percent, while patients with severe chronic lung disease may have baseline levels below 92 percent. In the setting of acute dyspnea, oxygenation levels lower than expected, or below a patient's known baseline, should be investigated and explained. A profound drop in SpO2 associated with exercise is characteristic of Pneumocystis pneumonia. SpO2 levels before and after exercise should be noted in patients suspected or known to have HIV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pulmonary infection in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other vital signs &ndash; Clinicians must review a complete set of vital signs.

Inspiratory stridor suggests obstruction above the vocal cords (eg, foreign body, epiglottitis, angioedema). Expiratory stridor or mixed inspiratory and expiratory stridor suggests obstruction below the vocal cords (eg, croup, bacterial tracheitis, foreign body).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wheezing suggests obstruction below the level of the trachea and is found with asthma, anaphylaxis, a foreign body in a mainstem bronchus, acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), or a fixed lesion such as a tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Crackles (rales) suggest the presence of interalveolar fluid, as seen with pneumonia or ADHF. They can also occur with pulmonary fibrosis. However, the absence of crackles does not rule out the presence of pneumonia, ADHF, or pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diminished breath sounds can be caused by anything that prevents air from entering the lungs.

It can be assessed by observing jugular venous distension or examining hepatojugular reflux.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulsus paradoxus &ndash; Pulsus paradoxus can occur when right heart function is compromised, such as can be seen with severe asthma, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac tamponade. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulsus-paradoxus-in-pericardial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Under normal conditions, inspiration increases systemic venous return and right heart volumes increase; the free wall of the right ventricle expands into the unoccupied pericardial space with little impact on left heart volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the pressure within the pericardial sac acutely increases, the effective compliance of all cardiac chambers is limited to that of the tightly-stretched pericardium (ie, highly constricted). As a result, the increase in right heart filling that occurs during inspiration can only be accommodated by a bowing of the interventricular septum toward the left heart. This leads to a reduction in left ventricular diastolic volume, a lower stroke volume, and a consequent decrease in systolic pressure during inspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In order to determine if a pulsus paradoxus is present, measure the patient's systolic blood pressure after a normal exhalation. Then have the patient inhale normally and determine systolic pressure when the lungs are expanded. Pulsus paradoxus exists if the difference in systolic pressures is greater than 10 mmHg. Keep in mind that the absence of pulsus paradoxus does not rule out any disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspection &ndash; Examine the skin for discoloration suggesting hypoxia or poor perfusion, signs of an allergic reaction, and evidence of trauma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremities &ndash; Peripheral edema may not occur with acute left heart failure, but if present suggests ADHF as the cause of dyspnea.

For patients with mild dyspnea and normal room-air arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), 2 liters per minute (LPM) of oxygen via nasal cannula is typically adequate. For hypoxic patients with respiratory difficulty, 50 to 60 LPM of oxygen should be provided via a nonrebreather mask. To deliver this much oxygen, open the flow meter valve until the indicator lies well beyond the 15 LPM mark.</p><p>Patients breathing 100 percent oxygen deliver five times as much oxygen to the alveoli per unit of ventilation as those breathing room air and in the absence of parenchymal disease can maintain a normal SpO2 with only two or three breaths per minute. Note, however, that the best nonrebreather oxygen delivery systems provide only 85 percent oxygen.</p><p>Do NOT withhold oxygen from patients with COPD. The target oxygen saturation in such patients is 90 to 94 percent with the understanding that this may reduce ventilatory drive and cause hypercarbia. However, failure to oxygenate the patient may have profoundly adverse consequences. If a clinician determines that a COPD patient requires endotracheal intubation, oxygen delivery should be maximized without regard for the target oxygen saturation or hypercarbia.

For patients that require ventilatory assistance to overcome an infraglottic challenge (eg, bronchospasm or parenchymal disease) or nonpulmonary disease (eg, neuromuscular disease), both noninvasive and invasive strategies exist. Noninvasive ventilation with a mask delivering continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BLPAP) can increase minute ventilation, reduce the work of breathing, recruit alveoli, and improve hemodynamics. Noninvasive ventilation improves outcomes in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) or a COPD exacerbation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Noninvasive ventilation does NOT improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of asthma and diseases that do not respond rapidly to medical therapy (eg, pneumonia and ARDS). In such instances, endotracheal intubation and controlled mechanical ventilation should be pursued aggressively when ventilatory support is needed.

Often therapy assists in diagnosis. As examples, an improvement in SpO2 immediately after the administration of low-flow oxygen indicates a ventilation-perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> mismatch, while rapid improvement following treatment with bronchodilators strongly suggests bronchoconstriction. Failure to improve with oxygen administration may indicate a right to left shunt. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An electrocardiogram (ECG) and stat portable chest radiograph (CXR) should be obtained early in the course of management when appropriate. The ECG may reveal signs of cardiac ischemia, such as ST segment deviations or inverted T waves. Findings of right heart strain (eg, inverted T waves in the right precordial or inferior leads, complete or incomplete right bundle branch block, right axis deviation) are consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE). Diffuse low voltage or electrical alternans in a patient with dyspnea and hypotension suggests pericardial tamponade. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A portable CXR may reveal cardiomegaly and other signs of pulmonary edema, a pneumothorax, hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms suggestive of COPD, or an infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia. Nevertheless, many life-threatening causes of dyspnea may not manifest any abnormality on CXR. Bedside ultrasound can be useful in making the diagnosis of pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Plain chest radiograph (CXR)'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Pericardial and limited cardiac examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pneumothorax#H26874124\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pneumothorax&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should take care not to confuse pneumonia and ADHF, which can have a similar appearance on CXR and sound similar with auscultation. Blood pressure, treatment response, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can help to distinguish the two. Pneumonia is more often associated with a normal or low blood pressure, does not respond to early therapy, and is generally NOT associated with a rise in BNP. ADHF is generally associated with a high blood pressure, often responds to aggressive early therapy, and is associated with a rise in BNP. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Brain natriuretic peptide'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of PE can be difficult to make. Although most patients with dyspnea secondary to a PE demonstrate some abnormality on CXR or ECG, there are no pathognomonic findings in either test. A definitive diagnosis is made based upon imaging with a multidetector CT or ventilation perfusion scan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although obvious causes of dyspnea are treated as they are identified, in some instances the cause of dyspnea is not immediately apparent. In such cases, the ED clinician must intervene with treatments or by obtaining emergent consultation based upon the clinical context and available data. As examples, such interventions may include broad spectrum antibiotics when infection is suspected or stress dose glucocorticoids for patients who use such medications chronically (eg, patients with chronic asthma).</p><p>When managing a life-threatening complaint with a broad differential diagnosis such as severe, acute dyspnea, it is crucial that emergency clinicians not fall prey to premature diagnostic closure. Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings that contradict the clinicians initial impressions must be carefully considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonemergent management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most instances, the emergency clinician can determine the diagnosis or the need for hospital admission based upon a thorough history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram.

These are listed above. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Initial interventions and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Often the cause of dyspnea cannot be determined with certainty in the ED. In such cases, the clinician's job is to treat and appropriately triage the patient based upon the clinical scenario and an assessment of the patient's risk.

The differential diagnosis of dyspnea is broad and may involve abnormalities affecting the upper airway, lungs, heart, chest wall, diaphragm, and nervous system, including both mechanical and chemical receptors. The differential diagnosis is described by organ system in the text (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52926\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52926 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common life-threatening causes of acute severe dyspnea include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute coronary syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute heart failure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arrhythmia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pericardial tamponade</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary embolism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pneumonia or other infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>COPD exacerbation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asthma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angioedema and anaphylaxis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poisoning (eg, carbon monoxide)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trauma (eg, pneumothorax, hemothorax)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common diagnoses among elderly patients presenting to an ED with a complaint of acute shortness of breath and manifesting signs of respiratory distress (eg, respiratory rate &gt;25, SpO2 &lt;93 percent) are decompensated heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism, and asthma. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important elements of the history and physical examination in patients with acute dyspnea are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Signs that portend imminent respiratory arrest include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Depressed mental status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inability to maintain respiratory effort</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cyanosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients in respiratory distress often appear anxious and sit bolt upright or in a tripod position. They often breathe rapidly. Stridor or wheezing may be audible. Signs suggestive of severe respiratory distress include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Retractions and the use of accessory muscles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Brief, fragmented speech</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inability to lie supine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Profound diaphoresis; dusky skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Agitation or other altered mental status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A plain chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram are obtained in most emergency department (ED) patients with acute dyspnea. Dyspnea biomarker panels do not appear to improve accuracy beyond clinical assessment and focused testing. The use of ancillary studies in the patient with acute dyspnea is discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three primary goals exist for the emergency clinician faced with an acutely dyspneic patient: optimize arterial oxygenation; determine the need for emergent airway management and ventilatory support; and, establish the most likely causes of dyspnea and initiate treatment. For any patient with acute severe dyspnea, the following measures are performed immediately:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oxygen is provided</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intravenous access is established and blood obtained for laboratory measurements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring is instituted</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Airway management equipment is brought to the bedside</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A screening examination, including an assessment of airway difficulty and a search for rapidly reversible causes (tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, upper airway foreign body) is performed.
