(See <a href=\"#H46193899\" class=\"local\">'Classification and definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of group 3 PH varies depending upon the underlying disease and its severity with rates ranging from 20 to 90 percent. Most patients in group 3 PH have <strong>mild to moderate</strong> elevations in mean pulmonary artery pressure (eg, mPAP 25 to 34 mmHg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F112828\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112828 \">table 2</a>). In contrast, to patients with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), few patients in group 3 PH (&lt;5 percent) have severe PH (mPAP &ge;35 mmHg or mPAP &ge;25 mmHg, and elevated right atrial pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a cardiac index &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>. The severity of PH appears to correlate with the severity of the underlying disorder. (See <a href=\"#H680313403\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction (HPVC) with remodelling of the pulmonary vascular bed are common mechanisms that underlie the development of PH in patients with chronic lung disorders <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxemia. However, other mechanisms are likely also involved. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high index of suspicion for PH should be maintained and Doppler echocardiography performed in patients with chronic lung disorders <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxemia who have the following: exertional dyspnea or hypoxemia disproportionate to the severity of the underlying lung or sleep disorder, features suggestive of right-sided heart failure, enlarged pulmonary artery or right ventricle on imaging, and a severe reduction in diffusing capacity (especially one that is decreased out of proportion to the severity of the restrictive or obstructive defect). Echocardiography should also be performed in patients with at least moderate obstructive disease and patients with interstitial lung disease who need supplemental oxygen as well as in patients suspected as having coexistent left-sided heart disease. Additional testing may be performed to rule out other competing or contributing etiologies or to help narrow the differential. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selecting patients for right heart catheterization (RHC) depends upon factors including the suspected severity of PH, the potential for PAH-specific therapy, the values and life expectancy of the patient, candidacy for transplant, and potential prognostic information. In general, patients suspected to have severe group 3 PH or an alternate class should undergo RHC, while patients suspected to have mild PH or who have contraindications do not need RHC until PH progresses or the contraindication resolves; RHC in patients with suspected moderate PH should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Patients in whom RHC is being considered should be referred to a center with expertise in PH.
