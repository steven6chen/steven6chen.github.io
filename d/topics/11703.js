The cardinal clinical feature is increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections. Patients often present with large, smoldering, cutaneous infections that have persisted for months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51967 \">picture 1</a>). They may also have lung abscesses and mastoiditis. The major pathogens include <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, other enteric gram-negative bacteria, and <em>Candida albicans</em>.</p><p>The diagnosis can be made by simply examining a peripheral blood smear. The neutrophils lack their specific granules and have bilobed nuclei, resembling the Pelger-Huet anomaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71996\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71996 \">picture 2</a>). Most have low or absent eosinophil counts since they lack the typical red staining granules. Early diagnosis of infections, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and aggressive management of infectious complications are critical. Successful hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was reported in one patient.</p><p>Other congenital defects in phagocytic function are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary disorders of phagocytic function: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chediak-higashi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chediak-Higashi syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An accurate estimate of the incidence or prevalence of neutrophil-SGD is difficult to obtain because the disease is so rare. Only a few cases in a handful of families have been reported worldwide since 1980, when the disorder was first defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Four case reports in the 1970s of patients with recurrent pyogenic infections and neutrophil maturation defects, with absence of secondary granules and impaired neutrophil function, may also have been cases of SGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The first case was reported in 1979 and a second case in 1980 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Since then, several other cases have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. The disease occurs in both males and females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactoferrin is absent in neutrophils of patients with neutrophil-SGD, but normal levels of lactoferrin are secreted by nasal epithelial cells in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Levels of RNA for neutrophil-specific granule products, including lactoferrin, transcobalamin F, neutrophil collagenase, neutrophil gelatinase, and defensins, are greatly reduced in SGD bone marrow compared with normal bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The findings above suggested a defect in a myeloid-specific transcription factor. This defect was identified in <span class=\"nowrap\">CCAAT/enhancer-binding</span> protein epsilon <span class=\"nowrap\">(C/EBP-epsilon),</span> a transcription factor expressed primarily in myeloid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> knockout mice were first noted to have neutrophil abnormalities and susceptibility to bacterial infections similar to patients with SGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This prompted the sequencing of the <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> locus in a patient with SGD. A five-base pair deletion in the second exon of <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> was identified in this patient. The frameshift resulted in a truncated protein that no longer had a DNA-binding region or transcriptional activity. Mutations in the <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> gene were identified in several additional patients with SGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. All patients had been homozygous for the mutated gene, with heterozygous parents. Thus, this disorder appears to have autosomal recessive inheritance. One patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] had a novel deletion in the leucine zipper domain of transcription factor of <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP</span> with a clinically less severe phenotype.</p><p>Of note, mutations in <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> have not been identified in all known patients with SGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One patient with SGD was identified who had a heterozygous mutation in the <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> gene but had elevated levels of <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Growth factor independence 1 (Gfi-1) was low in this patient, although a mutation in the gene for this transcription factor was not found. Gfi-1 represses transcription of <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span>. In a mouse model, reduced levels of Gfi-1 are associated with decreased levels of specific granule proteins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CCAAT/enhancer-binding</span> protein epsilon <span class=\"nowrap\">(C/EBP-epsilon)</span> is expressed exclusively in myeloid and T cells. The defect in <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> appears to block the transition of neutrophils from the promyelocyte to myelocyte stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75855 \">figure 1</a>), so the cells are released in an abnormal state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Primary or azurophilic granule proteins are produced in myeloblasts and promyelocytes, whereas secondary or specific granule proteins are synthesized in myelocytes and metamyelocytes and tertiary or gelatinase granule proteins are generated in bands and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57400\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57400 \">table 1</a>). Thus, both specific and gelatinase granules are absent in patients with SGD, and abnormalities are seen in azurophilic granules as well.</p><p>Lactoferrin deficiency and absence of specific granules were the first defects noted in patients with this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/1,2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,17</a>]. Lactoferrin, which is the primary enzyme in specific granules, has strong bacteriostatic properties. Specific granules play an important role in neutrophil locomotion and oxidative metabolism. These granules contain various receptors as well as enzymes. Chemotactic receptors in specific granules translocate to the cell membrane when activated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Neutrophils from a patient with SGD showed a reduced chemotactic response to several stimuli and decreased neutrophil and monocyte mobilization in response to skin abrasion (Rebuck skin window technique) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Neutrophils also had decreased oxidative responses.</p><p>It was later found that neutrophils from patients with SGD are also deficient in defensins, <span class=\"nowrap\">microbicidal/cytotoxic</span> proteins present in azurophilic granules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This defect also occurs in Chediak-Higashi neutrophils, and it contributes to the tendency to develop severe pyogenic infections in both diseases. The almost complete absence of defensins is due to a reduced level of defensins per granule rather than a decrease in the number of azurophilic or primary granules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, both specific and azurophilic granules are affected in SGD.</p><p>Eosinophil granules are also affected in this disease. Eosinophils in patients with SGD cannot be distinguished from neutrophils by light microscopy, because both are granule deficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These eosinophils contain eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and Charcot-Leyden crystal protein and proliferate when exposed to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), as do normal eosinophils. However, these cells lack eosinophil-specific granule proteins, including eosinophilic cationic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and major basic protein.</p><p>Abnormalities in monocytes are also seen with this disease. Monocytes (CD14+ cells) from a patient with SGD were found to have decreased levels of the monocyte-specific enzyme, nonspecific esterase, and electron-microscopic examination revealed morphologic differences between SGD monocytes and normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) modulates acute phase reactants and enhances B cell antibody production, and interleukin 8 (IL-8) is chemoattractant involved in cellular migration into tissues during an inflammatory response. IL-6 levels were lower and IL-8 levels were higher during sepsis in patients with SGD compared with normal controls. Macrophages in <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> knockout mice had decreased chemotaxis and cytokine production, as well as reduced capacity to accumulate lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Platelet disorders with associated bleeding diatheses are also reported. One patient who had increased bleeding following surgical procedures lacked intermediate- and high-molecular-weight von Willebrand factor (vWf) multimers and had no poststimulation increase of vWf surface expression on platelets due to decreased binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Platelet fibrinogen and fibronectin were also reduced in this patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age of presentation of neutrophil-SGD is in the first few years of life. The cardinal clinical feature is increased susceptibility to both skin and deep-seated pyogenic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/1,2,17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,17,25</a>], although there is one reported patient with a unique mutation who had only cutaneous infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Patients with SGD usually present with severe, chronic cutaneous infections, often with ulcers and abscesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51967 \">picture 1</a>). Chronic and recurrent lung infections, including pneumonia and abscesses, are also common. Patients may also develop septicemia and recurrent mastoiditis, otitis media, and lymphadenitis with draining lymph nodes. One infant presented with vomiting, intractable watery diarrhea, and failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Recurrent pulmonary infections can lead to chronic lung disease. The patient may be clinically stable if infections are controlled and there is no permanent damage to the lungs or another vital organ.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathognomonic laboratory findings in neutrophils on a peripheral smear are paucity or absence of specific granules and predominantly bilobed nuclei (pseudo Pelger-Huet anomaly) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71996\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71996 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Eosinophils may be mononuclear and are not easily distinguished from other &quot;granulocytes&quot; by light microscopy, because they also lack their characteristic granules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Neutrophils have abnormal chemotaxis (locomotion), normal aggregation but impaired disaggregation, decrease bactericidal activity, and abnormal superoxide release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-neutrophil-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of neutrophil disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major pathogens are <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, and other enteric gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Fungal infections with <em>C. albicans</em> may also occur.</p><p>Bleeding time may be prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thrombocytopenia may occur during infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is made by examining a peripheral smear and is confirmed by electron microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71996\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71996 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/1,7,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,27,28</a>]. All the &quot;granulocytes&quot; will lack specific granules, making it difficult to distinguish neutrophils and eosinophils. Most of the neutrophils will have bilobed nuclei. Histochemical analysis of the neutrophils will reveal deficiency of lactoferrin, B-12 binding protein, and defensins. Most patients have mutations in the <span class=\"nowrap\">CCAAT/enhancer-binding</span> protein epsilon <span class=\"nowrap\">(C/EBP-epsilon)</span> gene. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p>Flow cytometry may be useful for rapidly confirming the diagnosis. Expression of neutrophil granule proteins was examined by flow cytometry in a patient with neutrophil-SGD, confirmed by mutation analysis of the <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBP-epsilon</span> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This testing revealed severe deficiencies in defensin, lactoferrin, <span class=\"nowrap\">bactericidal/permeability-increasing</span> protein (BPI), human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide 18 (hCAP18), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). These proteins are all present in neutrophil granules, and their deficiency confirms SGD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections are often more severe than suggested by the clinical examination because of defective inflammatory responses. Early diagnosis of infections, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and aggressive management of infectious complications are critical management components. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Acute infections'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment consists mainly of intensive intravenous antibiotics for active infections. Prophylactic antibiotics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, are recommended to prevent infection, based upon data from other primary phagocytic disorders. Growth factors, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) might be considered. Surgical excision and debridement of the larger cutaneous and soft tissue abscesses are often required.</p><p>One patient underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) at 18 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutrophil-specific-granule-deficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Her course was complicated by <em>Candida</em> infection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and mild venoocclusive disease. At 1.5 years after HCT, she was well and had full donor cell engraftment. Her gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and intractable diarrhea) and recurrent infections have disappeared.
