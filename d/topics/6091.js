Venous ablation is indicated in patients with symptoms and signs of venous disease that persist in spite of a trial of medical management, and documented reflux in the target vein (ie, retrograde flow &gt;0.5 seconds). The patient's symptoms should directly relate to the incompetent veins being treated.

We prefer to wait a minimum of six weeks after delivery in pregnant patients before performing EVLA.</p><p>Patients with congenital venous abnormalities (eg, Klippel Trenaunay syndrome, Parkes Weber syndrome) should generally not undergo ablation of major superficial veins. Selected patients may, however, benefit from localized management of symptomatic segments (sclerotherapy, stab phlebectomy).

If the arterial circulation is found to be inadequate for wound healing, the arterial disease should be addressed prior to treating the venous disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136652\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136660\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The veins of the lower extremity are divided into superficial, perforating, and deep veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55019%7EPC%2F52340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019 graphicRef52340 \">figure 1A-B</a>). The superficial veins lie superficial to the muscle fascia. The perforating veins cross the fascia and connect the superficial veins to the deep veins that are located beneath the fascia. The deep veins are <strong>never</strong> treated with endovenous therapies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Great saphenous vein &ndash; The great saphenous vein (GSV) is one of the two main superficial veins in the lower extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55019%7EPC%2F52340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019 graphicRef52340 \">figure 1A-B</a>). It is the longest vein in the body and originates on the medial aspect of the dorsal foot. It crosses anterior to the medial malleolus and ascends along the medial aspect of the leg and thigh. Just below the inguinal ligament, it enters the fossa ovalis and terminates in the common femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small saphenous vein &ndash; The small saphenous vein (SSV) originates laterally from the dorsal venous arch of the foot, crosses posterior to the lateral malleolus, and ascends in the posterior calf (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55019%7EPC%2F52340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019 graphicRef52340 \">figure 1A-B</a>). In the upper calf, the SSV passes through the deep muscle fascia and terminates in the popliteal vein; however, the anatomy at the sapheno-popliteal junction is variable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82053 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The SSV can join a superficial cephalad extension in the posterior thigh (vein of Giacomini), connect to both the popliteal vein and the posterior thigh vein, or join the popliteal vein with no major tributaries near the junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82053 \">figure 2</a>). Anatomic variations in the SSV have implications for SSV ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Anterior ASVs are located anteriorly, and can be found in the thigh or leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55019%7EPC%2F52340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019 graphicRef52340 \">figure 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perforator veins &ndash; The normal flow in the perforating veins is from superficial to deep; however, many perforators demonstrate bidirectional flow. When the perforating veins are incompetent, flow is from deep to superficial. The most clinically significant perforating veins connect the posterior arch vein to the posterior tibial vein. These veins, termed posterior tibial perforators, were formerly known as Cockett's perforators.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136668\"><span class=\"h2\">Saphenous nerve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The saphenous nerve is the largest cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve. It lies near the superficial femoral artery in the thigh, exiting the adductor canal traveling deep to the sartorius muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66562%7ESURG%2F52007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66562 graphicRef52007 \">figure 3A-B</a>). It typically becomes superficial after it emerges medially between the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis muscles at the knee and then travels adjacent to the GSV. The saphenous nerve provides sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the leg. The saphenous nerve is adherent to the saphenous vein in the distal third of the calf [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136676\"><span class=\"h2\">Sural nerve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identi&#64257;cation of the relative anatomy of the sural nerve to the small saphenous vein is important for avoiding damage to the sural nerve during endovenous laser ablation. </p><p>The sural nerve is a cutaneous nerve coursing along the small saphenous vein and traversing posterior to the lateral malleolus toward the fifth toe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62917 \">figure 4</a>). The sural nerve provides cutaneous innervation to the posterior leg and lateral foot. In an autopsy study, the sural nerve was separated from the small saphenous vein by the deep muscular fascia above the inferior border of the gastrocnemius muscle, but below the inferior border of the gastrocnemius muscle, the sural nerve perforated the deep fascia to run in close proximity to the small saphenous vein, where it can easily be injured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The sural nerve can vary in its course from the usual anatomy in up to one-half of patients and can usually be identified using ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136684\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION AND LASER DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lasers emit a single, coherent wavelength of light (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69001\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69001 \">figure 5</a>). Laser therapy of venous structures is based upon the concept of selective photothermolysis (ie, selective thermal confinement of light-induced damage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The wavelength of light is chosen based upon the chromophore (the part of a molecule responsible for its color) of the target tissue. Vein wall injury is mediated directly by absorption of photon energy by the vein wall (thermal radiation) and indirectly by thermal convection from steam bubbles, and thermal conduction from heated blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

The wavelength of laser may impact outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H715137012\" class=\"local\">'Vein closure rates'</a> below.)</p><p>Some have speculated that the use of a bare laser fiber may lead to inhomogeneous vein wall destruction due to a tendency of the tip to become located eccentrically within the vein. A flared tip (Tulip Tip, Tobrix), designed to center the laser and promote more homogeneous heating, is commercially available in Europe, but not in the United States. One trial using this device noted reduced postoperative ecchymosis and pain; however, the differences demonstrated were small and likely not clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Similarly, mild differences in post-procedure pain were identified using the 1470 nm laser catheters with a radial fiber compared with the bare-tip fiber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136692\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation is performed by taking a careful history, performing a physical exam, and obtaining noninvasive vascular laboratory studies.

The general technique is described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136812\"><span class=\"h3\">Prepare and position the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is positioned supine for treatment of the GSV or ASVs. The prone position is preferred for treatment of the SSV but it can be successfully treated in the supine position. The leg should be prepped to include the saphenofemoral junction (for treatment of the GSV) or the sapheno-popliteal junction (for treatment of the SSV) since these areas must be imaged with ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136820\"><span class=\"h3\">Place the device sheath</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important that the patient is relaxed and well hydrated. The patient is placed in reverse Trendelenburg position to engorge the target vein, a position that facilitates venous access. Using ultrasound guidance, a micropuncture cannula is introduced into the vein near the knee for GSV ablation or near the ankle for SSV ablation and a long guidewire advanced toward the saphenofemoral junction (or sapheno-popliteal junction). </p><p>On occasion, the vein may develop spasm during venipuncture. Carefully selecting an accessible portion of the vein and successfully obtaining access upon the first attempt greatly reduce the risk of vasospasm. Placement of a venous tourniquet just proximal to the vein or the application of 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> paste over the vein may break the spasm and prevent the need for a second venipuncture. Alternatively, a cutdown to access the vein can be performed.</p><p>Difficulty advancing the wire or the sheath into the proximal vein may be encountered in the presence of a tortuous vein, venous aneurysms or vein segments that are sclerotic or occluded. Severely tortuous vein segments cannot be treated, though this should be recognized in advance on preoperative duplex ultrasound. (See <a href=\"#H715136645\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H715136756\" class=\"local\">'Vein mapping/marking'</a> above.) </p><p>Mildly tortuous venous segments, sclerotic segments and venous aneurysms can usually be crossed with manual manipulation of the overlying skin or by using a hydrophilic wire (eg, glidewire). Segmental occlusions can be managed with two treatments administered through two separate sheaths placed proximal and distal to the occlusion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136828\"><span class=\"h3\">Position the catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 4 French laser sheath is advanced over the wire and positioned in the proximal vein. Correct catheter position is critical to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis. The tip of the laser should be placed at least 2 cm below the saphenofemoral (or sapheno-popliteal) junction and the position confirmed with ultrasound. Ideally, the catheter tip should be just distal to at least one tributary vein to ensure continued flow in the more proximal vein. Be aware of arteries in close proximity to the vein to minimize the possibility of creating an arteriovenous fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Examples include a deep external pudendal artery coursing posterior to the proximal GSV and sural artery branches in close proximity to the SSV or perforators.</p><p>Patients with variant SSV anatomy with no tributaries to the proximal SSV may be at a higher risk for deep vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].(See <a href=\"#H715136660\" class=\"local\">'Venous anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H715136884\" class=\"local\">'Small saphenous ablation'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the sheath is in place, the patient should be placed in the Trendelenburg position. This serves to empty and allow better contact of the laser catheter to the wall of the vein, which may help reduce postprocedure pain. </p><p>The laser sheath is backed out to expose the tip of the laser catheter. The position of the tip of the catheter should be rechecked with ultrasound and correct placement confirmed. This is a critical portion of the procedure. Sometimes air bubbles in the gel or hair around the groin can reduce visibility. Also, imaging the catheter in obese patients with deep veins can be a challenge. If technical issues obscure the catheter, and its position cannot be positively ascertained, the procedure should be aborted and an alternative procedure performed (eg, vein stripping, sclerotherapy). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136836\"><span class=\"h3\">Instill tumescent anesthetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With ultrasound imaging, an echogenic micropuncture needle is used to inject tumescent anesthesia into the tissue surrounding the vein. Tumescent anesthesia has several important functions including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing anesthesia during EVLA</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facilitating contact of the vein wall with the laser tip</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deepening the vein relative to the skin to protect the skin from damage during laser treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting as a heat sink to protect surrounding tissues, especially sensory nerves, from the thermal damage during laser treatment</p><p/><p>After completion of the tumescent anesthesia, it is important to confirm with ultrasound that a halo of tumescent anesthetic surrounds the catheter, especially in the region of the saphenofemoral junction, and to ensure that the catheter and vein are at least 1 cm deep to the skin. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136844\"><span class=\"h3\">Ablate the vein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After adequate tumescent anesthesia has been delivered, the vein is ready for treatment. The catheter is slowly pulled back at an initial rate of 1 mm every second for the first 10 cm of treatment length. Thereafter, the catheter can be pulled back 2 to 3 mm every second. A slow, steady pullback provides even heating of the entire vein segment and minimizes the chance of vein perforation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136852\"><span class=\"h3\">Perform completion ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following completion of the procedure, ultrasound examination of the common femoral vein (or popliteal vein for treatment of the SSV) is performed to confirm patency and exclude thrombus. Closure of the treated vein is confirmed. The vein should appear thickened (ie, hyperechoic doughnut) with thrombus in its lumen with no identifiable venous flow. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136860\"><span class=\"h3\">Perform supplemental procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following successful closure of the target veins, the extremity is evaluated for any significant residual varicose veins, which can be managed with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy depending upon their size or operator preference. (See <a href=\"#H715136724\" class=\"local\">'Planning supplemental procedures'</a> above.)</p><p>When we identify large varicose tributaries to the ablated vein, we selectively perform stab phlebectomy or sclerotherapy at the time of the EVLA to prevent superficial thrombophlebitis. Treating longer lengths of the GSV reportedly reduces the need for supplemental procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Doing so may increase the risk of saphenous nerve injury. (See <a href=\"#H715136980\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial randomly assigned 65 patients with above and below-knee GSV reflux into three groups: above knee GSV EVLA, mid-calf to groin (extended) GSV EVLA, or above knee EVLA plus below knee GSV foam sclerotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. All patients experienced significant improvements in symptoms; the extended EVLA group had the highest patient satisfaction and the lowest requirement for subsequent sclerotherapy, and the below-knee foam sclerotherapy group was a close second. The need for additional sclerotherapy was 61 percent in the above knee EVLA group versus 17 and 36 percent, in the extended GSV EVLA. and above knee plus below knee GSV foam group, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The same group of investigators evaluated 69 below-knee GSV segments with duplex ultrasound six weeks following above-knee GSV EVLA, and found 59 percent had no or minimal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

As a result, we prefer to treat ASVs that demonstrate significant reflux at the same time as GSV ablation. The second sheath needs to be placed in the ASV prior to instillation of tumescent anesthesia. We treat the GSV first, since it is usually the larger vein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715136884\"><span class=\"h3\">Small saphenous ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic variation in the sapheno-popliteal junction is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In approximately 30 percent of patients, the SSV does not communicate with the popliteal vein; rather, it drains cephalad continuing as the superficial posterior thigh vein (vein of Giacomini). In some individuals, the SSV drains into the popliteal vein directly with no significant tributaries. These patients have a higher risk of developing deep venous thrombosis with SSV endovenous ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Extensive concurrent vein excision may require stronger analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>).

The main purpose of the postoperative duplex study is to carefully evaluate the proximal extent of the ablated vein for thrombus and to determine whether any thrombus extends into the deep veins. Thrombus extending from the saphenous vein into the proximal deep vein cephalad to the level of the ablation can lead to DVT, although this is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This process has been termed endovenous heat-induced thrombus (EHIT). If the initial ultrasound demonstrates no thrombus in the deep vein, repeat ultrasound is not required unless the patient develops new symptoms. Thrombus within the deep vein is treated accordingly. (See <a href=\"#H715136972\" class=\"local\">'Deep vein thrombosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a retrospective review of 312 perioperative vein mappings, patients with valvular incompetence at the saphenofemoral junction or a large proximal GSV diameter had a significantly increased risk of developing EHIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Patients who developed EHIT had a mean great saphenous diameter of 13.1 mm and 11 percent had saphenofemoral junction incompetence. In comparison, those who did not develop EHIT had a mean diameter of 8.4 and only 0.44 percent had saphenofemoral junction incompetence. A review of over 4000 EVLA treatments supports the notion that increasing the distance of the laser tip from the saphenofemoral junction reduces the risk of EHIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Superficial venous thrombosis with thrombus up to but not into the common femoral vein due to endovenous heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) is thought to be more benign than spontaneous thrombus in this location. A repeat ultrasound should be performed within a week. Patients with thrombus in the proximal saphenous vein due to EHIT may or may not be anticoagulated while awaiting repeat ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The author's experience is consistent with the latter reports. Pulmonary embolism and stroke in a patient with a patent foramen ovale have also been reported following EVLA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p>Some of the variation in the incidence of DVT may also be related to how well the saphenofemoral junction is examined with duplex ultrasound following EVLA. An experienced technician should perform the examination. (See <a href=\"#H715136924\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative duplex ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p>The majority of DVT following EVLA appears to be related to extension of clot from thrombus induced in the ablated vein and is more commonly partially occlusive (level IV or V) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112355\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112355 \">figure 6</a>). Direct thermal injury to the deep veins due to catheter tip malposition can also occur. Patients diagnosed with DVT are anticoagulated and a follow-up duplex ultrasound should be obtained in four to five days. </p><p>In many cases, thrombus contraction occurs with the thrombus no longer apparent within the common femoral vein, at which point anticoagulation may be discontinued. DVT due to endovenous therapies usually resolves within two weeks following initiation of anticoagulation, which is faster than with spontaneous DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/37,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,47</a>]. In our experience, most resolve within a week. Patients whose thrombus extension into the deep vein persists are treated with anticoagulation and repeat ultrasound in two to three weeks. If thrombus contraction has occurred, the patient can discontinue anticoagulation. Anticoagulant agents for outpatient therapy for DVT in general are discussed separately.</p><p>Specifically for EHIT, some investigators have switched to using novel oral anticoagulants to avoid subjecting patients to low-molecular-weight-heparin injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Symptoms of saphenous nerve injury include pain or numbness along the medial aspect of the calf or lateral foot and occasionally a feeling of pressure or tightness around the knee or ankle. These symptoms typically resolve four to six weeks after EVLA. </p><p>Because of the close proximity of the saphenous nerve and vein in the distal calf, saphenous nerve injury may be more likely when the endovenous sheath is placed below the level of the mid-calf, due to the adherence of the saphenous nerve to the saphenous vein in the distal third of the calf [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H715136668\" class=\"local\">'Saphenous nerve'</a> above.) </p><p>Adequate tumescent anesthesia is probably the most important factor in preventing nerve injuries.

Periprocedural quality of life measures were maintained following EVLA, but surgical patients experienced more pain and disability with a significant decline in five of eight Short Form 36 (SF-36) domains leading to a significant difference between the two treatments in pain scores. As a result, surgical patients took longer to return to work and normal activity compared with patients undergoing EVLA (14 versus 4 days). </p><p>Similar results have been noted for SSV EVLA.

EVLA is used primarily to treat venous insufficiency of the axial veins (ie, great, small, or accessory saphenous veins). (See <a href=\"#H715136631\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease#H703316837\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;, section on 'Vein ablation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for endovenous laser ablation are patients with persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs</span> of venous disease after a trial of medical therapy plus documented reflux (ie, retrograde flow &gt;0.5 second duration) as a source of their symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H715136638\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endovenous laser ablation is typically performed in an office or ambulatory surgery setting with local anesthesia and anxiolytics. If concurrent vein excision is performed, moderate sedation is preferred. (See <a href=\"#H715136764\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For great saphenous vein (GSV) ablation, we suggest not extending EVLA below the mid-calf to minimize the risk of saphenous nerve injury (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Symptoms of saphenous nerve injury may include pain or numbness along the medial aspect of the calf or lateral foot. These symptoms typically resolve within four to six weeks of the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H715136820\" class=\"local\">'Place the device sheath'</a> above and <a href=\"#H715136980\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some degree of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bruising is common following EVLA and a mild superficial phlebitis is expected. Pain associated with EVLA is usually controlled with over-the-counter pain medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>). Pain gradually resolves over time and is improved by wearing compression stockings. Extensive concurrent vein excision may require stronger analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>). (See <a href=\"#H715136908\" class=\"local\">'Pain management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1229227692\" class=\"local\">'Patient instructions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H715136740\" class=\"local\">'Compression stockings'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duplex ultrasound should be performed within two to three days of the procedure to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis.
