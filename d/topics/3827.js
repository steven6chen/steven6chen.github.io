This disorder contrasts with acute pancreatitis, which is an acute inflammatory response to pancreatic injury and is usually nonprogressive, although the two conditions may overlap. Recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis may lead to chronic pancreatitis over time.</p><p>Chronic and acute pancreatitis can be distinguished by several features.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pancreatitis may be asymptomatic over long periods of time, can present with a fibrotic mass, or there may be symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency without pain. Acute pancreatitis is almost always painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum amylase and lipase concentrations tend to be normal in patients with chronic pancreatitis, but are almost always elevated with acute disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morphologically, chronic pancreatitis is a patchy focal disease characterized by a mononuclear infiltrate and fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76728\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76728 \">picture 1</a>). In contrast, acute pancreatitis diffusely involves a large portion of the entire pancreas with a predominantly neutrophilic inflammatory response.</p><p/><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical features and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. The etiology, pathogenesis, complications, and treatment of this disorder in adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two primary clinical manifestations of chronic pancreatitis are abdominal pain and pancreatic insufficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is a dominant feature of chronic pancreatitis. The pain is typically epigastric, often radiates to the back, is occasionally associated with nausea and vomiting, and may be partially relieved by sitting upright or leaning forward. The pain is often worse 15 to 30 minutes after eating. Early in the course of chronic pancreatitis, the pain may occur in discrete attacks; as the condition progresses, the pain tends to become more continuous.</p><p>The pain pattern in chronic pancreatitis varies among patients. This was illustrated in a prospective cohort of 207 patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis in which two typical pain patterns were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The first was characterized by episodes of pain (usually lasting less than 10 days) with pain free intervals lasting from months to more than a year. The second pattern was characterized by prolonged periods of daily pain or clusters of severe pain exacerbations often requiring repeated hospitalizations.</p><p>In addition, although abdominal pain is the most consistent finding in patients with chronic pancreatitis, it may be absent in some cases. In one series, for example, 20 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis presented with evidence of pancreatic exocrine or endocrine dysfunction in the absence of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These findings are consistent with a second study in which 45 percent of asymptomatic alcoholics had evidence of chronic pancreatitis on postmortem examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe pancreatic exocrine dysfunction cannot properly digest complex foods or absorb partially digested breakdown products. Nevertheless, clinically significant protein and fat deficiencies do not occur until <strong>over 90 percent</strong> of pancreatic function is lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Fat malabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Steatorrhea usually occurs prior to protein deficiencies since lipolytic activity decreases faster than proteolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The clinical manifestations of fat malabsorption include loose, greasy, foul smelling stools that are difficult to flush. Malabsorption of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> may also occur, although clinically symptomatic vitamin deficiency is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pancreatic diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose intolerance occurs with some frequency in chronic pancreatitis, but overt diabetes mellitus usually occurs late in the course of disease. Patients with chronic calcifying disease, particularly those who develop early calcifications, may develop diabetes more frequently than those with chronic noncalcifying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Diabetes is also more likely to occur in patients with a family history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes; this observation suggests a role for an underlying decrease in pancreatic reserve or in insulin responsiveness. Pancreatic surgery (including drainage or pancreaticoduodenectomy) does not appear to increase the risk of diabetes. Exceptions include distal pancreatectomy and significant pancreatic resection in the setting of extensive pancreatic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Diabetes which develops in patients with chronic pancreatitis is usually insulin requiring. However, it is different from typical type 1 diabetes in that the pancreatic alpha cells, which produce glucagon, are also affected; as a result, there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia, both treatment related and spontaneous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.) Diabetic ketoacidosis and nephropathy are rare; neuropathy and retinopathy occur more frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pancreatitis also may be associated with a variety of complications. These include pseudocyst formation, bile duct or duodenal obstruction, pancreatic ascites or pleural effusion, splenic vein thrombosis, pseudoaneurysms, and, as will be discussed below, pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.) Patients may also develop acute attacks of pancreatitis, particularly alcoholics who continue drinking. Acute pancreatitis should be suspected in patients with chronic pancreatitis who develop a sudden worsening or changing pattern of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69116\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69116 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis can be challenging since laboratory studies and imaging procedures may be normal. In addition, patients may have symptoms suggestive of chronic pancreatitis but in fact have pancreatic carcinoma. On the other hand, the classic triad of pancreatic calcifications, steatorrhea, and diabetes mellitus strongly suggests the diagnosis, but are usually seen together only in late, very advanced disease. The diagnosis is confirmed if there are calcifications within the pancreas on abdominal plain films or computed tomography (CT) scan, an abnormal pancreatogram revealing beading of the main pancreatic duct or ectatic side branches, or an abnormal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> pancreatic function test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic cancer is the primary diagnosis that must be considered in patients suspected of having chronic pancreatitis. The differential diagnosis also includes autoimmune pancreatitis, lymphoma, and pancreatic endocrine tumors. Acute pancreatitis may also be difficult to distinguish from chronic pancreatitis in some patients.</p><p>There are data to suggest that chronic pancreatitis is associated with an increased risk of developing pancreatic carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In a report from the International Pancreatitis Study Group, 2015 patients with chronic pancreatitis were followed for a mean of 7.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A total of 56 pancreatic cancers were identified. The expected number of cases of cancer calculated from country-specific incidence data and adjusted for age and sex was 2.13, yielding a standardized incidence ratio (the ratio of observed to expected cases) of 26.3. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Findings suggestive of possible pancreatic cancer in a patient thought or known to have chronic pancreatitis include older age, absence of a history of alcohol use, weight loss, a protracted flare of symptoms, and the onset of significant constitutional symptoms. Supporting data for malignancy include a pancreatic duct stricture greater than 10 mm in length on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Markers such as CA 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are helpful if abnormal, but normal values do not rule out pancreatic cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum concentrations of amylase and lipase may be slightly elevated in patients with chronic pancreatitis, but are more commonly normal for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pancreatitis is a patchy, focal disease, leading to a minimal increase in pancreatic enzymes within the blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is frequently significant fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76728\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76728 \">picture 1</a>), resulting in decreased abundance of these enzymes within the pancreas.</p><p/><p>Thus, serum measurements of amylase or lipase should be reserved only for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and not chronic pancreatitis where they are neither diagnostic nor prognostic. It is not unusual that a patient with elevated amylase or lipase values &lt;3 times the upper limit of normal is labeled as having chronic pancreatitis when, in fact, these are non-diagnostic.</p><p>The complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests are typically normal. Elevations of serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase suggest compression of the intrapancreatic portion of the bile duct by edema, fibrosis, or pancreatic cancer. Markers of autoimmune chronic pancreatitis include an elevated ESR, IgG4, rheumatoid factor, ANA, and anti-smooth muscle antibody titer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Steatorrhea should no longer be diagnosed qualitatively by Sudan staining of feces since it is nonspecific. A 72-hour quantitative fecal fat determination is the gold standard. The quantitative test is usually performed over 72 hours; excretion of more than 7 g of fat per day is diagnostic of malabsorption, although patients with steatorrhea often have values greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. In the proper clinical setting (eg, in a patient with typical symptoms of abdominal pain), confirmation of increased fecal fat excretion may be sufficient to diagnose chronic pancreatitis.</p><p>Given the cumbersome nature of the 72-hour fecal fat test, measurement of fecal elastase can be helpful for evaluating pancreatic exocrine dysfunction and it is considered the test of choice. Among pancreatic function tests, fecal elastase measurement is the most sensitive and specific, especially in the early phases of pancreatic insufficiency. In addition, its values are independent of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and require only a single random stool sample. According to unpublished data from the manufacturer, values less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> are suggestive of pancreatic insufficiency (sensitivity and specificity of 93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies that may be useful in chronic pancreatitis include abdominal plain films, transabdominal ultrasound, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">(MRI/MRCP),</span> endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and endoscopic ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain films</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcifications within the pancreatic duct are present on plain film in approximately 30 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52624\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52624 \">image 2</a>). Calcium deposition is most common with alcoholic pancreatitis, but is also seen in the hereditary and tropical forms of the disorder; it is rare in idiopathic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">CT, MRI, and US</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transabdominal ultrasonography (US), CT scan, and MRI may show calcifications, ductal dilatation, enlargement of the pancreas, and fluid collections (eg, pseudocysts) adjacent to the gland (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68600\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68600 \">image 3</a>). The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis are 60 to 70 percent and 80 to 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The corresponding values for CT scanning are 75 to 90 and 85 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is becoming the diagnostic test of choice since it can demonstrate calcifications and pancreatic duct obstruction consistent with chronic pancreatitis. In addition, no radiation risk is involved. MRI may also be helpful for diagnosis of a rare segmental form of chronic pancreatitis (Groove pancreatitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Secretin-enhanced MRCP is being increasingly studied for evaluation of pancreatic exocrine function and in the early diagnosis of pancreatitis. The available data suggest that it may enhance visualization of the pancreatic duct, but whether it aids in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains to be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis may have pancreatic atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the most common cause of pancreatic atrophy is aging, in which case it affects the gland diffusely and is common in slim, elderly patients. Other causes of pancreatic atrophy include prior necrotizing pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and advanced hemochromatosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shwachman-diamond-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shwachman-Diamond syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ERCP has frequently been the test of choice for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis when calcifications are not present on a plain film of the abdomen and there is no evidence of steatorrhea. However, with the advances in the quality of MRCP in visualizing the pancreatic ducts (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a>), many centers are limiting the use of ERCP to cases with the potential need of therapeutic intervention (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'CT, MRI, and US'</a> above). Characteristic beading of the main pancreatic duct and ectatic side branches is diagnostic of chronic pancreatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62322\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62322 \">image 4</a>). One classification system, the Cambridge classification, has divided patients into three categories based upon ductal changes on ERCP: equivocal changes (Cambridge I); mild to moderate changes (Cambridge II); and considerable changes (Cambridge III). In one report, this classification scheme correlated with the degree of pancreatic dysfunction: no patients with normal ducts on ERCP had functional impairment, while 50 percent of those with Cambridge II changes suffered from pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>However, some patients with early chronic pancreatitis have a normal pancreatogram. Thus, unless there have been longstanding symptoms (eg, more than four years), a normal study should not rule out the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. If the disorder is suspected despite a normal ERCP, other imaging studies (eg, endoscopic ultrasound) or pancreatic function testing should be considered, depending upon individual expertise with these techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) may be as sensitive as ERCP or pancreatic function testing, but requires a highly skilled gastroenterologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. The most predictive endosonographic feature is the presence of stones. Other suggestive features include: visible side branches, cysts, lobularity, an irregular main pancreatic duct, hyperechoic foci and strands, dilation of the main pancreatic duct, and hyperechoic margins of the main pancreatic duct. Many endosonographers consider the presence of four or more of these features to be highly suggestive of chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several invasive and noninvasive tests are available for the diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency, which can be classified as direct or indirect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct tests involve the stimulation of the pancreas through the administration of a meal or hormonal secretagogues, after which duodenal fluid is collected and analyzed to quantify normal pancreatic secretory content (ie, enzymes, and bicarbonate). Only a few specialized centers perform these tests. Their main role is in the diagnosis of early chronic pancreatitis in patients with compatible clinical features but without characteristic radiographic findings. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> pancreatic function testing in diagnosing chronic pancreatitis are 82 and 86 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect tests measure the consequences of pancreatic insufficiency and are more widely available. However, they depend upon the consequences of pancreatic maldigestion, which are generally not apparent until normal enzyme secretory output has declined by more than 90 percent. Thus, they are insensitive to early pancreatic insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past few years, genetic mutations have been associated with chronic pancreatitis. These genes include the CFTR gene responsible for cystic fibrosis, SPINK-1, which encodes for trypsin inhibitor, and the PRSS-1 gene linked to hereditary pancreatitis.</p><p>In a study where extensive sequencing of the CFTR gene was performed in conjunction with functional analyses, 44 percent of patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis were found to have at least one variant in the CFTR gene which was associated with CFTR dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The fact that 22 percent of healthy controls had at least one variant in that study combined with the data that over 2000 variants (ie, not disease proven mutations and thus of unknown significance) have been detected in the CFTR gene by extensive sequencing, indicates that CF genotyping should not be performed routinely to diagnose a patient with chronic pancreatitis. Alternatively, sweat chloride testing may be of benefit since it assesses CFTR function and does not rely on full gene sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Up to 10 percent of patients will have abnormal results, which should prompt further investigation of occult male infertility or lung disease and may warrant professional genetic counseling.</p><p>SPINK-1 mutations are present in 23 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis but are seen in 2 percent of healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In conjunction with the finding that homozygous mutations can be found in healthy individuals, testing for this gene is presently not of diagnostic or therapeutic benefit and hence not recommended.</p><p>PRSS-1 mutations can be diagnostic of hereditary pancreatitis which can present with recurrent acute episodes of pancreatitis and progress to the chronic form.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One approach to the evaluation of a patient with suspected chronic pancreatitis in whom the laboratory evaluation is normal is to consider an abdominal imaging study. Contrast enhanced CT scan can rule out other causes of pain such as malignancy, or complications of pancreatitis including pseudocysts. In settings where magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is available and of high quality, it may be the imaging test of choice, allowing for assessment for ductal changes and potentially obviating the need for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Secretin</a> pancreatic function testing or endoscopic ultrasound should be considered in patients with normal imaging who are suspected to have chronic pancreatitis. Secretin pancreatic function testing and endoscopic ultrasound are not needed to diagnose chronic pancreatitis in patients who have pancreatic steatorrhea confirmed by a stool elastase measurement. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic ultrasonography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic function tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine full genetic analyses of CFTR and SPINK-1 are not recommended since they are not necessarily diagnostic for chronic pancreatitis, are expensive, do not generally alter management, and may result in inappropriate labeling of an individual as having cystic fibrosis. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Steer ML, Waxman I, Freedman S.
