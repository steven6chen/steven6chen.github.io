The number of platelets per unit varies according to the platelet count of the donor; a yield of 7 x 10<sup>10</sup> platelets is typical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since this number is inadequate to raise the platelet count in an adult recipient, four to six units are pooled to allow transfusion of 3 to 4 x 10<sup>11</sup> platelets per transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These are called whole blood-derived or random donor pooled platelets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Advantages of pooled platelets include lower cost and ease of collection and processing (a separate donation procedure and pheresis equipment are not required). The major disadvantage is recipient exposure to multiple donors in a single transfusion and logistic issues related to bacterial testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Apheresis (single donor) platelets</strong> &ndash; Platelets can also be collected from volunteer donors in the blood bank, in a one- to two-hour pheresis procedure. Platelets and some white blood cells are removed, and red blood cells and plasma are returned to the donor. A typical apheresis platelet unit provides the equivalent of six or more units of platelets from whole blood (ie, 3 to 6 x 10<sup>11</sup> platelets) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In larger donors with high platelet counts, up to three units can be collected in one session. These are called apheresis or single donor platelets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Advantages of single donor platelets are exposure of the recipient to a single donor rather than multiple donors, and the ability to match donor and recipient characteristics such as HLA type, cytomegalovirus (CMV) status, and blood type for certain recipients. (See <a href=\"#H382870465\" class=\"local\">'Ordering platelets'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Issues related to the effects of platelet pheresis on the donor are covered elsewhere.

These WBC can cause febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), alloimmunization, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD) in some patients.</p><p>Platelet products also contain plasma, which can be implicated in adverse reactions including transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H382870592\" class=\"local\">'Complications of platelet transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>Several strategies are used to prevent the complications associated with WBC and plasma contamination of platelets. (See <a href=\"#H382870465\" class=\"local\">'Ordering platelets'</a> below.)</p><p>Platelets concentrates also contain a small number of RBCs that express Rh antigens on their surface (platelets do not express Rh antigens). The small numbers of RBCs in apheresis platelets negates the issue of Rh alloimmunization in most patients. However, blood banks avoid giving platelets from Rh<sup>+</sup> donors to Rh<sup>-</sup> female patients because of the potential risk of Rh alloimmunization and subsequent hemolytic disease of the newborn.

The threshold for prophylactic transfusion varies depending on the patient and on the clinical scenario. (See <a href=\"#H558395341\" class=\"local\">'Specific clinical scenarios'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no ideal tests for predicting who will bleed spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Studies of patients with thrombocytopenia suggest that patients can bleed even with platelet counts greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, bleeding is much more likely at platelet counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span>. Among individuals with platelet counts between <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL,</span> clinical findings can be helpful in decision-making regarding platelet transfusion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The platelet count at which a patient bled previously can be a good predictor of future bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Petechial bleeding and ecchymoses are generally not thought to be predictive of serious bleeding, whereas mucosal bleeding and epistaxis (so-called &quot;wet&quot; bleeding) are thought to be predictive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coexisting inflammation, infection, and fever also increase bleeding risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying condition responsible for a patient's thrombocytopenia also may help in estimating the bleeding risk. As an example, some<strong> </strong>patients with ITP often tolerate very low platelet counts without bleeding, while patients with some acute leukemias that are associated with coagulopathy (eg, acute promyelocytic leukemia) can have bleeding at higher platelet counts (eg, 30,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H558395341\" class=\"local\">'Specific clinical scenarios'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with adults, children with bone marrow suppression may be more likely to experience bleeding at the same degree of thrombocytopenia. In a secondary subgroup analysis of the PLADO trial, in which patients were randomly assigned to different platelet doses, children had more days of bleeding, more severe bleeding, and required more platelet transfusions than adults with similar platelet counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, these findings do not suggest a different threshold for platelet transfusion in children, as the increased risk of bleeding was distributed across a wide range of platelet counts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests for platelet-dependent hemostasis (ie, bleeding time, thromboelastography, and other point of care tests) are generally not used to predict bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-function-testing#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet function testing&quot;, section on 'The in vivo bleeding time'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-function-testing#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet function testing&quot;, section on 'Instruments that simulate platelet function in vitro'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H323107\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic versus prophylactic transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By convention, most authors use the term &quot;therapeutic transfusion&quot; to refer both to transfusion of platelets to treat active bleeding and transfusion of platelets in preparation for an invasive procedure that could cause bleeding. The term &quot;prophylactic transfusion&quot; is used to refer to platelet transfusion given to prevent spontaneous bleeding.</p><p>We use prophylactic platelet transfusion to prevent spontaneous bleeding in most afebrile patients with platelet counts below <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> due to bone marrow suppression. We use higher thresholds (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL)</span> in patients who are febrile or septic. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have a coexisting coagulopathy, and we use a platelet transfusion threshold of 30,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span> for them. (See <a href=\"#H558395349\" class=\"local\">'Leukemia, chemotherapy, and HCT'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with platelet consumption disorders (eg, immune thrombocytopenia [ITP], disseminated intravascular coagulation) and platelet function disorders are typically transfused only for bleeding or, in some cases, invasive procedures. Platelets should not be withheld in bleeding patients with these conditions due to fear of &quot;fueling the fire&quot; of thrombus formation. (See <a href=\"#H558395722\" class=\"local\">'Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H558395714\" class=\"local\">'TTP or HIT'</a> below and <a href=\"#H323385\" class=\"local\">'Platelet function defects'</a> below.)</p><p>Given the need to balance the risk of spontaneous bleeding with the potential complications of unnecessary platelet transfusion, the decision of whether to transfuse platelets based upon a clinical event (ie, for active bleeding or invasive procedures) or at a particular threshold (ie, to prevent spontaneous bleeding) is challenging. Standard practice has evolved to transfusion of platelets at a threshold platelet count of 10,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL</span> for most patients with severe hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia due to hematologic malignancies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the risks and benefits of reserving platelet transfusion for active bleeding episodes in these patients continue to be evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/7,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18-21</a>]. Two randomized trials have evaluated outcomes with platelet transfusion for bleeding versus routine prophylactic transfusions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2012 trial from Germany, 400 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; patients with APL were excluded) and patients undergoing autologous HCT for hematologic malignancies were randomly assigned to receive platelet transfusions when morning platelet counts were <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span> or only for active bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients transfused only for active bleeding received fewer platelet transfusions during the 14-day period after induction or consolidation chemotherapy (1.63 versus 2.44 per patient, a 33.5 percent reduction). However, among patients with AML who were transfused only for active bleeding, there were more episodes of major bleeding (six cerebral, four retinal, and one vaginal) and there were two fatal intracranial hemorrhages compared with four retinal hemorrhages among patients transfused for a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span>. Patients undergoing HCT also experienced more bleeding episodes when transfused only for active bleeding, but most of these were minor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 2013 TOPPS trial (Trial of Prophylactic Platelets), 600 patients with hematologic malignancies receiving chemotherapy, autologous, or allogeneic HCT were randomly assigned to receive platelet transfusion for a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span> or only for active bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Compared with those who received prophylactic transfusions, patients transfused only for active bleeding received fewer platelet transfusions during the 30-day period after randomization, but had a higher incidence of major bleeding (50 versus 43 percent) and a shorter time to first bleed (1.2 versus 1.7 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There were no differences in the duration of hospitalization, and no deaths due to bleeding. In a predefined subgroup analysis, patients undergoing autologous HCT had similar rates of major bleeding whether they were transfused for a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;10,000/microL</span> or only for active bleeding (45 and 47 percent). However, this may reflect a shorter duration of severe thrombocytopenia in this population and more aggressive, early treatment of suspected bleeding in the context of a clinical trial, rather than an inherently different rate of bleeding.</p><p/><p>The findings from these trials support continued use of prophylactic transfusion for patients with hematologic malignancies and HCT until further data become available. Although the findings suggest that reserving platelet transfusion for active bleeding may be safe for some adults undergoing autologous HCT, such a strategy requires intensive monitoring and the ability to perform immediate imaging for suspected CNS or ocular bleeding. We do not recommend reserving platelet transfusion for active bleeding in patients with HCT outside of a clinical trial or a specific protocol in a highly specialized center with the ability to support this level of vigilance. (See <a href=\"#H558395349\" class=\"local\">'Leukemia, chemotherapy, and HCT'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H558395341\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC CLINICAL SCENARIOS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several common clinical scenarios that raise the questions of whether to transfuse patients prophylactically to prevent bleeding, and, if prophylactic transfusion is used, of what platelet count is the best threshold for transfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H558395349\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukemia, chemotherapy, and HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with leukemia, or those being treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy or undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) have a suppressed bone marrow that often cannot produce adequate platelets. We use prophylactic transfusion in these settings, assuming the patient is hospitalized, afebrile, and without active infection. We generally use a threshold platelet count of <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> (ie, transfuse for a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10,000/microL)</span>. An exception is acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), for which the threshold is higher (ie, transfuse for a platelet count of &lt;30,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL)</span> due to a higher bleeding risk. If fever, sepsis, or coagulopathy is present, or if the patient is not hospitalized <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cannot be closely monitored, higher thresholds may be needed.</p><p>This approach is in line with the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115892 \">table 1</a>) and a 2015 practice guideline from the AABB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. It is supported by randomized trials comparing prophylactic (ie, threshold-based) and therapeutic platelet transfusion, in which patients who did not receive prophylactic transfusion had more severe bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/22,25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,28</a>]. While the 2017 ASCO guideline suggests that some individuals undergoing autologous HCT may omit prophylactic platelet transfusions if they are being treated in a highly specialized center, we do not believe there is sufficient evidence to support this approach in most practice settings and clinical scenarios, and we continue to use prophylactic transfusions in our practice unless the patient is enrolled in a clinical trial or is following a specific institutional protocol, as discussed above.

Although platelets do not express Rh antigens, platelet products contain small numbers of RBCs, which could be Rh incompatible with the recipient. Thus, when an Rh(D)-negative woman of childbearing age receives a platelet transfusion, platelets from an Rh(D)-negative donor are used, in order to prevent alloimmunization and HDFN. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) advises administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rho-d-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rho(D) immune globulin</a> in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Even if this is not done and platelets from an Rh(D)-positive donor are used, the risk of alloimmunization remains low. This was illustrated in a retrospective analysis of 1014 Rh(D)-negative patients who received 6043 platelet transfusions from Rh<sup>+</sup> donors (89 percent from pooled platelets); in this series no patients who received only apheresis platelets developed anti-RhD antibodies, and 12 of 315 (3.8 percent) who received pooled platelets developed anti-RhD antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, in a series of 59 Rh(D)-negative patients transfused with platelets from an Rh(D)-positive donor for a non-hematologic condition such as pneumonia or surgery (typical dose, one to three units, given without Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>), alloantibodies to Rh(D) were detected in eight (13.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>To further reduce the risk of alloimmunization if only Rh<sup>+</sup> platelets are available, Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> can be coadministered with platelet transfusions. Each dose of Rh(D) immune globulin is considered sufficient to prevent alloimmunization for up to 15 mL of Rh(D)-positive RBCs, and most units of platelets do not contain more than 0.5 mL of RBCs. Thus, a single dose of Rh(D) immune globulin is likely to be sufficient even if several units of platelets are transfused. If necessary, this can be repeated once every eight weeks (ie, a similar interval to that used to prevent HDFN).

The relative frequency of complications with apheresis versus whole blood-derived, pooled platelets have not been studied in large randomized trials. A 2008 systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated several small randomized trials (mostly with fewer than 100 patients) found a greater incidence of reactions with whole blood-derived platelets; however, this was no longer significant after controlling for the use of leukoreduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A 2016 study involving almost 800,000 platelet transfusions in France found that apheresis platelets were associated with a greater frequency of adverse reactions (approximately 6 per 1000 for apheresis platelets versus 2 per 1000 for whole blood-derived platelets) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In this study, all platelets were leukoreduced (during collection for apheresis, and before storage for whole blood-derived). However, comparison may be difficult due to the different size of apheresis versus pooled platelet units and the challenges of calculating the incidence per unit when multiple units are administered. Additional data are needed before a clear conclusion on relative risk of complications can be made. (See <a href=\"#H382870473\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Donor screening procedures and pathogen inactivation do not completely eliminate the risk of bacterial and other bloodborne infections, and infection by bacterially contaminated platelets represents a serious hazard of platelet transfusion.

Therefore, the incidence of bacterial contamination is higher for platelets than for red blood cells (RBC) (eg, approximately 1 in 2000 for platelets versus 1 in 30,000 for RBC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].

Platelet transfusion introduces approximately 200 mL of intravascular volume per transfusion. The incidence of TACO is in the range of one to three per 100,000 transfusions and is higher in patients predisposed to volume overload (eg, with comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, renal failure, respiratory failure, and positive fluid balance).

In this case, the HLA antigens on the donor lymphocytes are seen by the recipient lymphocytes as self, so recipient lymphocytes do not attack the donor lymphocytes; however, recipient cells also express unique HLA antigens that the donor lymphocytes recognize as foreign. This can result in donor lymphocytes destroying the recipient's tissues (eg, bone marrow, skin and liver), which can be fatal.

For patients undergoing invasive procedures, it is prudent to check that the desired platelet count was achieved before performing the procedure, which can be done within 10 minutes of the transfusion. For actively bleeding patients, cessation of bleeding is a more important clinical endpoint than the post-transfusion platelet count.</p><p>The length of time platelets have been stored has a modest effect on their survival in the recipient. As an example, compared with platelets stored for two or three days, platelets stored for five days produce a smaller increment in platelet count.

Single donor (apheresis) platelets contain approximately 3 to 6 x 10<sup>11</sup> platelets (ie, the equivalent of six or more units) per unit. Platelets are stored at room temperature; consequently their shelf life is only approximately five days. (See <a href=\"#H558382031\" class=\"local\">'Platelet collection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H382870457\" class=\"local\">'Platelet storage and pathogen reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet transfusion can be lifesaving in bleeding patients with thrombocytopenia or reduced platelet function. Platelets should be transfused in any patient who is bleeding with a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(100,000/microL</span> for central nervous system or ocular bleeding), or in any patient with an acquired or inherited platelet function defect regardless of platelet count. Platelet transfusion may also be indicated in thrombocytopenic patients undergoing invasive procedures, depending on the procedure and the platelet count. (See <a href=\"#H558395184\" class=\"local\">'Actively bleeding patient'</a> above and <a href=\"#H558384448\" class=\"local\">'Preparation for an invasive procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other conditions that impair hemostasis (eg, coagulopathy, fever infection, anatomic defects) should be corrected in thrombocytopenic patients when possible to reduce active bleeding and to lessen the risk of spontaneous bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H558395184\" class=\"local\">'Actively bleeding patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use prophylactic platelet transfusion to prevent spontaneous bleeding in most hospitalized afebrile patients with platelet counts below <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> due to bone marrow suppression. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have a coexisting coagulopathy, and we use a platelet transfusion threshold of 30,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span> in these patients.

Platelets should <strong>not</strong> be withheld in bleeding patients with these conditions due to fear of &ldquo;fueling the fire&rdquo; of thrombosis.
