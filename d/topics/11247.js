CSA is usually best diagnosed during an attended in-laboratory polysomnographic (PSG)-based sleep test but can occasionally be diagnosed on a home sleep apnea test (HSAT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Risk factors, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>CSA can be primary (ie, idiopathic CSA) or secondary to other conditions (Cheyne-Stokes breathing, medical conditions such as stroke or heart failure, suppressant drug or substance use, high altitude periodic breathing, or treatment-emergent central sleep apnea). Alternatively, CSA can be classified as hyperventilation-related (eg, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, primary CSA) or hypoventilation-related (eg, central nervous system diseases, drugs or substances) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106782 \">table 1</a>). There is also a subset of conditions primarily associated with alveolar hypoventilation (neuromuscular diseases, severe thoracic cage disorders such as kyphoscoliosis) in which central sleep apneas or hypopneas may be present. In many of these conditions, central apnea is not the only or even dominant type of sleep-disordered breathing that is present. It is therefore prudent that the clinician be aware of the proportional spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing type in a given patient such that an appropriate modality targeted at the major type of sleep-disordered breathing is chosen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypoventilation syndromes without apneic events may be central (eg, spinal cord injury) or peripheral (eg, myasthenia gravis), and when severe enough may be treated with noninvasive positive airway pressure (PAP), the details of which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H4302705\" class=\"local\">'Patients with central hypoventilation syndromes'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4301971\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES AND GOALS OF POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (PAP)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3761008991\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of central sleep apnea (CSA) are associated with a medical disorder (eg, stroke, heart failure) or medications (eg, opioid). In this population, the primary form of therapy is treatment of the associated medical condition when possible, or removal of the offending medication. The clinician needs to be aware of potential dynamic changes in the severity of CSA related to these factors. This fact also emphasizes the need for medical optimization prior to sleep evaluation. Over time, improvement or resolution of the underlying cause may result in a reduced need for positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, necessitating re-titration at variable time points. (See <a href=\"#H622741622\" class=\"local\">'Goals of PAP titration in CSA'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1883747861\" class=\"local\">'Caveats of PAP titration in CSA'</a> below.)</p><p>PAP titration for the common causes of CSA, including heart failure, opioid use, and treatment-emergent sleep apnea, is discussed in the sections below.

The use of AHI as an outcome measure comes as an inference from data gathered predominantly in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adult-patients-with-central-sleep-apnea-syndromes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, in many instances, this goal may not be achieved due to the caveats outlined in the section below.</p><p>Due to the caveats associated with PAP titration in this population (see <a href=\"#H1883747861\" class=\"local\">'Caveats of PAP titration in CSA'</a> below), it is difficult to define a &quot;failure&quot; of any therapy that is tried. While some experts use AHI &lt;15 as a goal of therapy (and treat AHI &ge;15 as a &quot;failure,&quot; or a reason to change and adjust therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adult-patients-with-central-sleep-apnea-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], others use a more strict criterion of AHI &lt;5 as a definition of success. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1883747861\"><span class=\"h2\">Caveats of PAP titration in CSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast with patients who have OSA, PAP therapy may not eliminate all sleep-disordered breathing events in those with CSA, such that titration to this goal is challenging, especially in the absence of alternate well-defined goals. In addition, ventilatory instability associated with high loop gain can lead to overventilation and hypocapnia, which, in turn, can worsen central apnea, particularly when PAP is administered at higher pressures, a phenomenon termed &quot;pressure toxicity&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adult-patients-with-central-sleep-apnea-syndromes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], or when bilevel PAP is employed. Worsening CSA due to this phenomenon can, in turn, lead to an increase in sleep fragmentation and poor adherence.</p><p>Thus, PAP titration with the goal of resolving all central sleep-disordered breathing events may not be feasible in many patients with CSA syndromes. For this reason, attended in-laboratory PAP titrations are preferred with supervised polysomnographic (PSG) monitoring so that fine adjustments can be made to achieve the maximal pressure or optimal PAP modality that allows a minimum number of residual central apneas. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4301989\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH CSA AND HEART FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with heart failure should focus on optimizing heart failure medications as well as treating sleep-disordered breathing with positive airway pressure (PAP). If clinically significant central sleep apnea (CSA) persists despite maximal medical management, continuous PAP (CPAP) is the typical first-line PAP modality used in this population. Most patients should undergo a titration for CPAP in an attended in-laboratory setting. Titration for second-line modes (adaptive servo-ventilation [ASV] and bilevel positive airway pressure [BPAP] ventilation) are reserved for those who fail CPAP. (See <a href=\"#H4301995\" class=\"local\">'Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2867386511\" class=\"local\">'Patients with CSA and heart failure who fail CPAP'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4301995\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPAP provides positive pressure at a relatively constant level throughout inspiration and expiration. Two types of sleep-disordered breathing are common among patients with heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSA-CSB). The rationale for using CPAP in patients with heart failure is the correction of airway collapse that is associated with obstructive events but also transiently present at the end of central apneas and may lead to ventilatory overshot, hyperventilation, and oscillatory apneas in susceptible individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adult-patients-with-central-sleep-apnea-syndromes/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disordered-breathing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure&quot;</a>). Although in-laboratory CPAP titrations and in-hospital &quot;acclimation trials&quot; are sometimes used to determine the optimal CPAP in patients with CSA, there are no comparative data between these titration methods and no official guidelines to direct clinicians. Thus, many centers, including ours, perform attended in-laboratory CPAP titrations for this population. We feel that compared with the acclimation trial, an in-laboratory CPAP titration offers an opportunity to explore and troubleshoot mask interfaces and gives an ability to quickly correct or adjust settings that are clearly not working, thus improving the patient's first experience of PAP, which is an important predictor of long-term compliance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1116875649\"><span class=\"h3\">Attended in-laboratory PAP titration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a sleep laboratory setting, CPAP is initiated as the first modality at the lowest pressure (usually 4 or 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and gradually raised to eliminate <strong>obstructive</strong> events during sleep as determined by polysomnography (PSG). If <strong>central </strong>apneas or hypopneas persist at this point, the following are options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CPAP may be ramped up in 1 to 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O intervals to no greater than an additional 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to assure that no residual obstruction (hypopneas, respiratory effort-related arousals [RERAs]) is present, and then gradually brought down to a setting where obstruction is resolved and the number of central apneas is the lowest (ie, the &quot;optimal pressure&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adult-patients-with-central-sleep-apnea-syndromes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Concerns about &quot;pressure toxicity&quot; and potential hemodynamic effects of high PAP in patients with CSA and heart failure has led some centers to place a pressure limit on the titration and refrain from using CPAP pressures of &gt;10 to 18 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adult-patients-with-central-sleep-apnea-syndromes/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

This technology is similar to the auto-titrating technology used in CPAP devices. ASV devices with variable expiratory pressure do not require manual alterations of pressures, but auto-adjust expiratory pressures within the preset range in response to the airway obstruction encountered during individual breaths, while delivering pressure support for each breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adult-patients-with-central-sleep-apnea-syndromes/abstract/26,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,33</a>]. Typically, the minimum expiratory pressure is set at the level known to control obstruction, and the maximum expiratory pressure is limited to 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Although the use of auto-titrating technology may theoretically reduce the need for supervised testing, it is still recommended to initiate it during a supervised PSG. This is to assess efficacy for the individual patient and adjust pressure ranges and other settings for maximal efficacy.

With subsequent evidence of uncontrolled TE-CSA (based on the lack of symptomatic improvement or evidence of residual sleep-disordered breathing on interrogation of the device), an in-laboratory retitration study is then needed.

CSA can be primary (ie, idiopathic) or secondary to other conditions (eg, heart failure, opioid use). Because central apnea in many cases coexists with other types of sleep-disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea [OSA], hypoventilation), an appropriate modality targeted at the major type of sleep-disordered breathing should be chosen. (See <a href=\"#H4301931\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and causes of central sleep apnea (CSA)'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Risk factors, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because most patients with CSA have an underlying cause (eg, heart failure or opioid use), the primary form of therapy is often treatment of the associated medical condition or removal of the offending medication. Positive airway pressure (PAP) in patients with CSA, in contrast to those with OSA, often does not eliminate all apneic events. Therefore titration is more challenging and should occur in an in-laboratory setting with PSG monitoring so that the response can be maximized.

Patients should undergo a titration for CPAP during an attended in-laboratory PSG. Rarely, an &quot;acclimation trial&quot; may performed in those not suitable for an in-laboratory study. (See <a href=\"#H4301989\" class=\"local\">'Patients with CSA and heart failure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4301995\" class=\"local\">'Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CSA and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (&gt;45 percent) who fail CPAP, adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) and bilevel PAP (BPAP) in the <span class=\"nowrap\">spontaneous/timed</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/T)</span> mode are indicated and typically titrated in an attended in-laboratory PSG-monitored setting. We prefer ASV given its better acute efficacy in correcting central apneas. ASV and BPAP are contraindicated in those patients with CSA and a low ejection fraction (&le;45 percent) due to a lack of benefit and potential harm; these patients are typically treated with CPAP or CPAP with oxygen supplementation if CSA persists despite maximized medication therapy.

Finally, for those who fail ASV therapy, titration with <span class=\"nowrap\">BPAP-S/T</span> mode can be performed. This population generally has titrations performed during in-laboratory PSG and may require higher levels of pressure support to control concurrent hypoventilation. Testing in these populations typically involves monitoring of transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels. (See <a href=\"#H4302533\" class=\"local\">'Patients with CSA and opioid use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with OSA who have treatment-emergent central sleep apnea (TE-CSA), ASV titration during in-laboratory PSG is appropriate, either immediately upon recognition of TE-CSA if time permits during the same night, or during a separate subsequent polysomnogram. Initial treatment with CPAP and reassessment for residual TE-CSA after two to three months is also a reasonable approach. Finally, CPAP with an addition of low-flow oxygen is sometimes done especially in those patients who have another indication for nocturnal oxygen supplementation. (See <a href=\"#H4302641\" class=\"local\">'Patients with treatment-emergent CSA'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-emergent-central-sleep-apnea#H18678874\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with rare etiologies for CSA, choosing a method for PAP titration is individualized and dependent upon the modality chosen to deliver PAP as well as the underlying cause. (See <a href=\"#H4302699\" class=\"local\">'Patients with rare etiologies of CSA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with central hypoventilation syndromes (eg, obesity hypoventilation, congenital alveolar hypoventilation), central apneas tend to be a minor component of the sleep-disordered breathing. BPAP is first-line therapy and an in-laboratory BPAP titration is generally performed in this population. (See <a href=\"#H4302705\" class=\"local\">'Patients with central hypoventilation syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adult-patients-with-central-sleep-apnea-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Marin JM, Carrizo SJ, Vicente E, Agusti AG.
