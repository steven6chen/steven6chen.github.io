The most important thing is to eat a healthy diet. The number of calories you need depends on your age, weight, height, and how active you are. If you are trying to lose weight, breastfeeding might help. If you are not trying to lose weight, you might need to eat a bit more than usual to keep your body healthy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30443900\"><span class=\"h1\">Do women who breastfeed need to drink more?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Women who breastfeed need to make sure that they drink enough fluids. To make sure that you drink enough, always drink when you feel thirsty. If you have a dry mouth or dark-colored urine, you probably need to drink more. Some women find it helpful to keep water or another non-caffeine drink nearby when they breastfeed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30443907\"><span class=\"h1\">Do women who breastfeed need to take vitamins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women need to take a daily vitamin, depending on what they eat. Women who eat meat and fish do not usually need to take a daily vitamin. But women who do not eat meat, chicken, fish, or dairy foods should take a daily vitamin that has vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in it.</p><p>Some women need to take an iron supplement. Supplements are pills, capsules, liquids, or tablets that have nutrients in them. You might need to take a daily iron supplement if you have a condition called &quot;anemia&quot; after you give birth.</p><p>Women also need to make sure that they get enough calcium and vitamin D each day. Calcium and vitamin D help keep bones strong. Different foods and drinks have calcium and vitamin D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 1</a>). If you do not get enough calcium and vitamin D from your food and drink, you might need to take calcium and vitamin D supplements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30443914\"><span class=\"h1\">Should women who breastfeed avoid certain foods?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Women who breastfeed should avoid certain types of fish. That's because some types of fish have a lot of mercury in them. Mercury is a substance that can pass through the breast milk to the baby. It can cause problems with a baby's brain and nervous system. Fish that have a lot of mercury include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shark</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swordfish</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>King mackerel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tilefish</p><p/><p>Other types of fish and seafood do not have as much mercury. In fact, these are healthy for both you and your baby. Doctors recommend that women who breastfeed eat these types of fish and seafood about 2 times a week. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shrimp</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Canned light tuna</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salmon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pollock</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catfish</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30443921\"><span class=\"h1\">Should women who breastfeed avoid certain medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends. Let your doctor or nurse know if you take any medicines. He or she can make sure that those medicines are safe to take when breastfeeding.</p><p>Some medicines can affect the amount of breast milk a woman makes. For example, some hormone birth control pills can reduce the amount of breast milk a woman makes.</p><p>Also, doctors recommend that women who breastfeed not use illegal drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30443928\"><span class=\"h1\">Should women who breastfeed drink alcohol?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you drink, some alcohol does pass through your breast milk to your baby. After you have 1 drink, it takes about 2 hours for your body to get rid of the alcohol. Because of this, most doctors recommend having only an occasional drink that has the same amount of alcohol found in a single glass of wine. They also recommend that women wait 2 hours after having a drink before they breastfeed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30443935\"><span class=\"h1\">Should women who breastfeed drink caffeine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some caffeine can pass through the breast milk to the baby. Some babies can get fussy or have trouble sleeping from the caffeine if the mother drinks more than 3 cups of coffee per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30443942\"><span class=\"h1\">Should women who breastfeed smoke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. All mothers of newborn infants should stop smoking. That's because babies whose parents smoke can have breathing problems, lung infections, or ear infections. Also, smoking might reduce the amount of milk that you make.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30443949\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have questions?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have any questions about nutrition and breastfeeding, ask your doctor or nurse. Some women also find it helpful to work with a breastfeeding expert, called a &quot;lactation consultant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30444083\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weaning from breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breastfeeding-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-risks-to-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Secondhand smoke: Risks to children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-health-and-nutrition-during-breastfeeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Maternal health and nutrition during breastfeeding (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-guide-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breastfeeding guide (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
