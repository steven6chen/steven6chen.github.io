The syndrome is heterogeneous clinically and biochemically. The diagnosis of PCOS has lifelong implications with increased risk for metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and possibly cardiovascular disease and endometrial carcinoma. PCOS should be considered in any adolescent girl with a chief complaint of hirsutism, treatment-resistant acne, menstrual irregularity, or obesity.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of an adolescent with suspected PCOS is described here. Other aspects of PCOS in adolescents are reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768364214\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recommended for adolescent girls with one or more of the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormal degree of hirsutism or a hirsutism equivalent, such as inflammatory acne vulgaris, that is poorly responsive to topical therapies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual abnormality (persistent amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, or excessive uterine bleeding)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity or focal hirsutism accompanied by menstrual abnormality</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768363647\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest a stepwise approach to the evaluation that addresses the diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107842 \">table 1</a>). This approach is first outlined here and then detailed in the sections below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Basic evaluation</strong> &ndash; The evaluation begins with a focused clinical evaluation for the presence of hirsutism (or hirsutism equivalents) and menstrual abnormality. This is followed by laboratory testing for androgen excess by measuring total or free testosterone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59954\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59954 \">algorithm 1</a>). Patients with elevated testosterone levels are likely to have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). I advise further evaluating these patients to rule-out the most common non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism with ovarian ultrasonography and a screening panel of laboratory tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85781\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85781 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This evaluation excludes the vast majority of disorders that mimic PCOS. Some other experts reserve the ultrasonographic screening for those patients with atypical features, such as those with features suggestive of virilization, such as rapidly progressive hirsutism, or failure to respond to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H768363661\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H768363667\" class=\"local\">'Testing for hyperandrogenemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H768363685\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion of non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Demonstration of persistent hyperandrogenism in a patient with a persistently abnormal degree of menstrual irregularity fulfills the diagnostic criteria for PCOS if the endocrine screening tests are negative for the most common disorders that mimic PCOS. This minimalist approach is approximately 99 percent specific for PCOS in young women and meets international consensus criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lack of hyperandrogenism effectively rules out the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents. However, the ovarian hyperandrogenism of PCOS may not become demonstrable until a few years after menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, young patients with menstrual irregularity should be followed, and the diagnosis of PCOS should not be dismissed until their menses normalize and androgen levels remain persistently normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Further endocrine evaluation</strong> &ndash; The basic evaluation described above does not exclude rare virilizing disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91894\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91894 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In the presence of concern about the possibility of a rare virilizing disorder, such as a tumor or rare congenital disorders, a more comprehensive evaluation is suggested, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> suppression testing and cosyntropin testing, which determines the source of androgen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65682\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef65682 \">algorithm 3</a>). These tests also help to exclude the possibility that a mild PCOS picture is simply due to obesity. This approach is consistent with the hirsutism clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H768363709\" class=\"local\">'Further endocrine evaluation for rare disorders mimicking PCOS'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Additional evaluation after the diagnosis of PCOS</strong> &ndash; Girls diagnosed with PCOS should have additional evaluations for glucose intolerance and other features of the metabolic syndrome. Primary relatives of PCOS patients may also benefit from screening for these disorders, particularly if other risk factors such as obesity are present. (See <a href=\"#H768363734\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation of PCOS patients'</a> below and <a href=\"#H768363740\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of family members'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768363654\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768363661\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation starts with a thorough assessment of the clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and for disorders that mimic it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59954\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59954 \">algorithm 1</a>). The cutaneous manifestations of hyperandrogenism (particularly hirsutism or acne, which occur in approximately three-quarters of PCOS cases) provide clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism. An abnormal menstrual pattern constitutes evidence of oligo-anovulation. Assessment includes a history of medications that may either mask the symptoms (eg, oral contraceptives and topical or systemic acne medications) or cause the symptoms (eg, androgenic steroids, antiepileptic drugs).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hirsutism &ndash; The degree and distribution of sexual hair growth should be identified (eg, using the Ferriman-Gallwey score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66629 \">figure 1</a>)) and interpreted in the context of norms for the patient's age and ethnicity. Moderate or severe hirsutism (hirsutism score &gt;15) constitutes clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism in an adolescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The history should specifically explore whether the patient shaves excess hair or uses depilatory agents, which may obscure the physical findings, and whether the patient is taking medications that cause hirsutism (eg, anabolic steroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Hirsutism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acne &ndash; The degree of acne should be evaluated in the context of the patient's gynecologic age. The possibility of hyperandrogenism is suggested by moderate or severe inflammatory acne (&gt;10 lesions in any area, eg, face, chest, back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107843 \">table 3</a>)) through the perimenarcheal years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] or acne that is persistent and poorly responsive to topical dermatologic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H1359792857\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Acne'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menses &ndash; The age of menarche and subsequent menstrual patterns should be described and interpreted in the context of the patient's gynecologic age. The menstrual dysfunctions that suggest abnormal degrees of anovulation in adolescence are detailed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93199 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A menstrual pattern that is outside of these bounds for two years (or one year with supporting evidence for PCOS) can be considered a &quot;persistent&quot; abnormality and fulfills one of the two criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Note that normal menstrual regularity does not necessarily mean that ovulatory function is normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Anovulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The assessment also includes addressing the differential diagnosis of PCOS for familial hyperandrogenic disorders, medication usage, virilization (eg, rapidly progressive hirsutism), galactorrhea, Cushingoid or acromegaloid changes, or evidence of thyroid dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59954\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59954 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768363667\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing for hyperandrogenemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent serum testosterone elevation above adult norms in a reliable reference laboratory is the best evidence of hyperandrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Therefore, in the presence of clinical risk factors for PCOS, the routine evaluation should begin with measuring serum testosterone concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59954\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59954 \">algorithm 1</a>). The choice between initiating workup with assay of total or free testosterone depends on assay reliability and cost-effectiveness considerations discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If a reliable measurement of total testosterone is easily available, this can be used as an initial test, but should be followed by measurement of free testosterone if the results are not consistent with the patient's clinical course. If a reliable method for measuring serum free (or bioavailable) testosterone is available to the practitioner and cost is not an issue, this test is the preferred choice for initial testing. Measurement of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) should be included for those with severe or rapidly progressive hyperandrogenism to screen for a primary adrenal source.</p><p>Hyperandrogenemia is present in most cases of moderate or severe hirsutism, but only about one-half of cases of mild hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Therefore, moderate or severe hirsutism can constitute clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism, but should only be used as a diagnostic criterion when a reliable assay for hyperandrogenemia is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768363673\"><span class=\"h3\">Testosterone assays: choices and pitfalls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many pitfalls in testosterone assays at the low levels found in women, and reliable testosterone assays are not available to many physicians. For these and other reasons discussed below, assessment may be best deferred to a specialist.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total testosterone &ndash; A reliable total testosterone assay is critical to accurate assessment for biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism. The automated assays that are used to measure serum total testosterone in most laboratories are not suitable to accurately measure levels in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Results by the best available assays vary by an average of approximately 6 to 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. The interpretation of the laboratory results is further complicated by systematic differences between assays and excessively broad normal ranges derived from populations of apparently normal women with unrecognized androgen excess. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods are becoming the preferred method, but their availability is limited to major specialty laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free testosterone &ndash; An elevation of serum (or plasma) free testosterone is the single most sensitive test to establish the presence of hyperandrogenemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,6,10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,10,13,14</a>]. The combination of an upper-normal total testosterone and a lower-normal sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) yields a high free testosterone concentration. The serum free testosterone concentration is about 50 percent more sensitive for the detection of hyperandrogenemia than the total testosterone concentration. This is because PCOS is characterized by low levels of SHBG, which is the main determinant of the fraction of serum testosterone that is free, and thus bioactive, and the fraction that is weakly bound to albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. SHBG production by the liver is raised by estrogen and suppressed by androgen, insulin-resistant obesity, and hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although the low SHBG in obese individuals has been attributed to hyperinsulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], evidence suggests that monosaccharide excess itself and inflammatory cytokines mediate the SHBG response to obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite these advantages, assaying the free testosterone level introduces other potential sources of error. In part, this is because of systematic differences between assays and because there is no uniform standard. The most accurate androgen determinations come from specialty laboratories using established, validated assays in well-characterized control women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The only reliable methods report free testosterone that is <strong>calculated</strong> as the product of the total testosterone and a function of SHBG (free testosterone = total testosterone x percent free testosterone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The most common methods calculate percent free testosterone from the SHBG concentration or determine the percent free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis. An alternative reliable method is to instead calculate &quot;bioavailable testosterone&quot; by determining the percent of serum testosterone not precipitated with globulins by ammonium sulfate (the supernatant includes both the fraction free and that weakly bound to albumin, the latter being bioactive to the extent that it dissociates to free in a given tissue space dependent upon the local interstitial albumin concentration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. <strong>Direct</strong> assays of the free testosterone serum concentration are inaccurate and should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768363679\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation of testosterone levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal upper limit for serum total testosterone in adult women is approximately 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (1.4 to 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> when using most validated assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>]. The adult norm is the appropriate reference range for adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Most patients with PCOS have serum testosterone concentrations 29 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (1.0 to 5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. A total testosterone &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> increases the likelihood of a virilizing neoplasm.</p><p>For practical purposes, an elevated serum total and free testosterone at any time of day provides evidence of hyperandrogenism in an anovulatory cycle. However, a normal level in the afternoon does not exclude hyperandrogenemia. Partly this is because serum testosterone undergoes episodic changes of about twofold (trough-to-peak). Partly it is because norms are standardized for early morning on days 4 through 10 of the menstrual cycle in regularly cycling women because normal testosterone levels fall 10 percent from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM and rise transiently during midcycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Patients who have clinical features consistent with PCOS but have an initial normal total testosterone should have repeat testing, preferably an early morning serum free testosterone level calculated from SHBG in a reliable specialty laboratory.</p><p>The estrogen and progestin contents of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) interfere with the assessment of androgens. They suppress gonadotropins, elevate SHBG, and directly inhibit steroidogenic enzymes such as 3&szlig;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3&szlig;-HSD). They normalize androgens in PCOS and also have been reported to normalize androgens in some virilizing tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. After discontinuing COCs, normal women may transiently have a slightly high total testosterone level but a normal free testosterone level because SHBG turnover is slower than testosterone turnover.</p><p>Adolescents with PCOS or with features of PCOS that do not fulfill diagnostic criteria should be followed to determine that hyperandrogenemia and symptoms persist, since data are limited on the natural history of adolescent PCOS. The diagnosis of PCOS should not be fully dismissed until menses normalize and androgen levels remain persistently normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768363685\"><span class=\"h2\">Exclusion of non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hyperandrogenic patient should be further evaluated to screen for an underlying cause of androgen excess. The diagnosis of PCOS is made when other hyperandrogenic disorders are excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91894\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91894 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Anovulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>). For practical purposes, the endocrine screening panel is often performed at the same time as the initial testing for hyperandrogenemia (above), particularly in patients with a high clinical suspicion for PCOS (eg, oligomenorrheic girls with moderate or severe hirsutism).</p><p>In my pediatric endocrinology practice, I have performed basic screening for all patients with confirmed hyperandrogenism, consisting of panel of serum endocrine studies as described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85781\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85781 \">algorithm 2</a>). This screening evaluation excludes most of the non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism and is consistent with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Endocrine Society, and adolescent guidelines for the diagnosis of PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24,25</a>]. I also generally perform ultrasonography at this stage, primarily to exclude rare tumors. Other experts reserve ultrasonography for patients with atypical features, as outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H768363691\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> below and <a href=\"#H232265929\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine screening panel'</a> below.)</p><p>However, this exclusionary approach to the differential diagnosis will miss a few patients with rare disorders. Therefore, patients must at the least be followed closely to be sure they respond to therapy as expected. Patients with abnormal results of the endocrine studies, or with unusual features on history or physical examination suggesting rare causes of hyperandrogenism other than PCOS, may warrant further testing by a subspecialist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65682\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef65682 \">algorithm 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768363691\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is not recommended or required for the <strong>diagnosis</strong> of PCOS in adolescents, because the high frequency of polycystic-appearing ovaries in this age group makes this an unreliable criterion for the diagnosis of PCOS. The primary purpose of ultrasonography in the hyperandrogenemic adolescent is to exclude causes other than PCOS.

Furthermore, it has become apparent that these criteria are problematic in young adults because normal young adults have slightly larger ovaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and the newer high-definition vaginal imaging techniques show that small antral follicle counts up to 24 are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adult PCOM criteria are especially problematic when applied to adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. For one thing, an accurate antral follicle count cannot be defined by the abdominal ultrasonographic approach necessary in virginal adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. For another, even if an accurate follicle count is obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the adult criteria for PCOM overlap with criteria for a multifollicular ovary, which is defined by the presence of &ge;6 follicles of 4 to 10 mm diameter without increase in ovarian volume and is known to be a normal variant unrelated to hyperandrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Additionally, though data vary considerably, studies suggest that ovarian volume is slightly larger in adolescents than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28,31</a>].

Until further research establishes definitive criteria, evidence suggests that a mean ovarian volume &gt;12 cc (or single ovary &gt;15 cc) may be considered enlarged, and thus to constitute PCOM, in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, because of uncertainties about definitive criteria for PCOM and the wide range of findings in adolescents, PCOM is not included in the 2015 consensus diagnostic criteria for PCOS in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

In my pediatric endocrinology practice, I have recommended adrenal and ovarian ultrasonography for all patients with anovulatory symptoms and documented hyperandrogenemia, to exclude rare but serious androgen-producing tumors, as described below. Other experts perform ultrasonography only for selected patients with features that are atypical for PCOS, such as very high testosterone levels (eg, &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL),</span> clitoromegaly, rapidly progressive hirsutism, or poor response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The primary purpose of ultrasonography is to exclude the rare but serious adrenal or ovarian tumor and ovarian pathology not related to PCOS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85781\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85781 \">algorithm 2</a>). In addition, other pelvic pathology, including an ovotesticular disorder of sex development and the functional hyperandrogenism of pregnancy, can often be detected by ultrasonography. On rare occasions, ultrasonography has been insensitive in detecting a virilizing ovarian tumor in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], and it must be remembered that half of virilizing tumors are adrenocortical. Girls who have an ultrasound that shows an ovarian tumor or other explanation for hyperandrogenism should be referred for further evaluation and treatment of the underlying disorder. Otherwise, hyperandrogenic girls need further endocrine studies irrespective of whether the ovaries are polycystic, as discussed in the following section. (See <a href=\"#H232265929\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine screening panel'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ultrasonography also provides the opportunity for patient reassurance and education. For many women, the diagnosis of ovarian &quot;cysts&quot; raises a concern about tumors, so it is reassuring to know that a tumor has been ruled out by the ultrasound. The clinician can explain to the PCOS patient with a polycystic ovary that these are numerous small egg sacs that are not ovulating properly. Conversely, if a polycystic ovary is not visualized in a PCOS patient, the clinician can explain that the ovarian dysfunction is &quot;too mild to be seen on the ultrasound.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H232265929\"><span class=\"h3\">Endocrine screening panel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exclusion of disorders that commonly mimic PCOS is an integral part of the diagnostic process. All clinical guidelines recommend screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, prolactin excess, thyroid dysfunction, and acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,24-26,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24-26,36</a>]. However, the guidelines vary in which tests are recommended for universal screening, and which are recommended only for patients with symptoms suggestive of one of these disorders. These guidelines are based on expert opinion and no cost-effectiveness analyses have been performed. Therefore, the actual range of practice varies considerably among expert clinicians in this field.</p><p>In my pediatric endocrinology practice, I have typically performed the full range of screening tests outlined below for all patients presenting with suspected PCOS. I have taken this approach because I consider it to be both simple and an economic use of time for patients, and it permits a thorough screening workup within two visits. Some other experts select among these tests based on clinical symptoms and signs that raise concerns for a particular disorder. This approach considers the costs of the laboratory tests themselves, and recognizes that most of these disorders are rare in adolescents and usually can be identified by specific symptoms. PCOS is by far the most common cause of hyperandrogenic anovulation, and the most common of the disorders mimicking PCOS is nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which occurs in only about 3 percent of women in the United States. In the absence of a cost-effectiveness analysis, the optimal approach to the workup would seem to be an individualized one.</p><p>In my practice, I begin the specific work-up for PCOS by ordering a random serum free testosterone at the initial evaluation for hyperandrogenemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59954\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59954 \">algorithm 1</a>). At the same time, I generally include the most clinically relevant of the simple screening tests in the initial blood draw: prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and, if the patient is centrally obese, cortisol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85781\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85781 \">algorithm 2</a>). For practical reasons, after documentation of hyperandrogenemia, I ordinarily schedule the serum 17- hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85781\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85781 \">algorithm 2</a>) for early morning of the day of the ultrasound examination, since this test requires early morning sampling to be highly discriminatory in detecting nonclassic CAH. It is best to perform these tests in the untreated state because hormonal medications (eg, COCs, corticosteroids) affect these results.</p><p>Pregnancy should be excluded in all amenorrheic patients. My initial general evaluation of patients presenting with anovulatory symptoms also ordinarily includes ancillary evaluations of serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol, as well as a focused dietary history. The purpose of these tests is to screen for other causes of amenorrhea (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>); LH and FSH (and their ratio) are not useful in establishing the diagnosis of PCOS.

About one-quarter of adolescents with an abnormal degree of menstrual irregularity will have an elevated androgen level, but no clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism, and neither the menstrual abnormality nor the hyperandrogenemia will persist. In the absence of clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism or an abnormal degree of acne), a diagnosis of PCOS is not warranted in an adolescent with anovulatory symptoms and an elevated androgen level without other clinical manifestations of PCOS, unless both of these features are documented to persist for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>In patients with PCOS, hyperandrogenism will be persistent, and the following endocrine studies will be normal.

About a quarter of adolescents with PCOS meet proposed adolescent criteria for the metabolic syndrome.

At the least, a fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1C should be advised. However, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is preferable because it is the most sensitive and specific measure of glucose tolerance (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a>). This recommendation is consistent with the recommendations made by international reproductive endocrinology consensus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), and the minority position of the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) in adult women with PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].

In both series, almost all of the adolescents had no symptoms of diabetes. Impaired glucose tolerance suggests insulin resistance and is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Thus, an abnormal OGTT has important therapeutic implications.

The basis of the risk is multifactorial: it is related to the endometrial hyperplasia that arises from persistent estrogen stimulation without the progesterone-induced inhibition of proliferation and differentiation to secretory endometrium that occurs after ovulation. Hyperandrogenism, insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism, and the inflammatory changes of obesity appear to be aggravating factors in PCOS; risk also seems related to body mass index (BMI)-independent proto-oncogenic changes in endometrial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Mood, anxiety disorders, and emotional distress are increased in prevalence in PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].
