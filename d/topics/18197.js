(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-autoimmunity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of autoimmunity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A second category of immune-mediated disease results from inappropriate activation of antigen-independent inflammatory mechanisms. This group of disorders has been termed &quot;autoinflammatory diseases.&quot; An overview of autoinflammatory diseases is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Autoinflammatory diseases prominently involve cells of the innate immune system as well as the mediators associated with these cells. Thus, autoinflammatory diseases are broadly considered to represent primary diseases of innate immunity, in contrast to the <strong>autoimmune</strong> diseases that result from aberrant adaptive or acquired immunity. However, this separation is far from absolute.</p><p>The best characterized autoinflammatory diseases are relatively rare but florid conditions that arise from mutations in single genes. The prototypical autoinflammatory disorders are the periodic fever syndromes. One of these disorders, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS; MIM #142680, formerly known as familial Hibernian fever), is the subject of this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TRAPS is a rare disorder, with a prevalence of approximately one per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. While originally described in an Irish (Hibernian) kindred, cases have since been reported in many ethnic groups. Thus, ancestry plays little role in the consideration of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS/PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TRAPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The genetic defect in TRAPS resides in the gene that encodes the 55 kDa receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TNFR1 (TNF receptor superfamily member 1A, <em>TNFRSF1A</em> gene; MIM *191190) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In many, but not all, cases, the pathogenic variants result in impaired shedding of this receptor. Some of these <em>TNFRSF1A</em> variants have high penetrance (ie, most individuals with the variant develop the disease), while others have appreciable prevalence in healthy individuals. As an example, the arginine to glutamine missense mutation at amino acid 92 (R92Q mutation) is found in 2 percent of the Caucasian population but is nevertheless common among patients with a TRAPS-like illness that is usually milder and without amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. The P46L and T61I are common variants, particularly in <span class=\"nowrap\">Northern/Western</span> Africa and in Japan, respectively, but may occasionally be associated with TRAPS symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>There is no exact correlation between specific genetic mutation and clinical phenotype. However, the risk of secondary (inflammatory or amyloid A [AA]) amyloidosis is increased among patients with mutations affecting certain cysteine residues. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Secondary (AA) amyloidosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of human TRAPS remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Impaired shedding of TNFR1 eliminates an endogenous antagonist to circulating TNF. However, other mechanisms are probably more important since some patients have normal levels of soluble TNF receptor. An excess of retained surface TNFR1 may result in enhanced susceptibility to TNF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Conversely, mutant receptor may bind TNF less efficiently, leading to impaired TNF-driven apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Finally, mutant TNFR1 may misfold <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> traffic aberrantly within the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. These events can trigger an unfolded protein response (UPR, a cellular stress response associated with accumulation of unfolded or misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum) or initiate TNF-independent signaling within the cell that is potentially mediated by enhanced production of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species that disturb intracellular signaling pathways.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients present in the first decade of life (median 4.3 years in the largest series of 158 patients), but approximately 10 percent present over the age of 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/1,2,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent fevers over months or years in the absence of associated viral or bacterial infections are characteristic of TRAPS.

Other than fever, these clinical features are not typically observed in TRAPS. Recurrences of fever generally occur with nearly clockwork regularity, and laboratory markers of inflammation return to normal between episodes.

Normalization of inflammatory markers is believed to result in the greatest likelihood of avoiding amyloidosis in these patients, although the extent to which achieving this target is required to avoid amyloidosis or whether therapy should be escalated to attain serologic remission in a patient who is already in clinical remission remain unknown. Patients bearing the low-penetrance mutations R92Q and P46L generally exhibit less severe disease and a lower amyloidosis risk and may tolerate less intensive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4192853869\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with persistent symptoms or those who develop amyloidosis despite biologic therapy should be referred to regional or national centers specializing in the investigation and care of this rare disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of typical attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help to control fever, but glucocorticoids are typically required to terminate other clinical features of an attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Clinical experience and extrapolation from other autoinflammatory disorders suggest that early institution of biologic therapy lowers the risk of amyloidosis. Historically, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>) was first-line therapy for patients with frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe recurrences and for those with TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) gene mutations that are associated with a high risk of amyloidosis. However, efficacy data appear to favor interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade over anti-TNF therapy in TRAPS, even though there are no head-to-head studies. Thus, IL-1 antagonists have become the preferred first-line biologic treatment for these patients. Anakinra is a possible alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a> that could be given on demand rather than as a standing dose due to its much shorter half-life. Etanercept, an anti-TNF agent, is reserved for patients in whom IL-1 blockade is ineffective or poorly tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-interleukin-1 therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest IL-1 antagonists as first-line biologic treatment for patients with frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe recurrences, in particular for those with TNFR1 gene mutations that are associated with a high risk of amyloidosis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Canakinumab</a>, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-1-beta, has established efficacy. Anakinra is a possible alternative to canakinumab that can be given on demand rather than as a standing dose due to its much shorter half-life. Typical dosing for canakinumab is 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> given subcutaneously every four weeks, although some patients may need up to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> monthly while others will be able to maintain control at 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every eight weeks. Discontinuation of therapy altogether is rarely tolerated.</p><p>Although the molecular defect in TRAPS affects a receptor for TNF, aberrant trafficking of the mutant receptor leads to activation of intracellular stress pathways that lead to excess production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Small case series showing efficacy of IL-1 blockade in TRAPS led to increased first-line use of this class of biologics in this periodic fever syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/27,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,40-43</a>]. Subsequent clinical trials have confirmed these findings.</p><p>A phase-II clinical study demonstrated clear efficacy for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>, leading to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the drug for the treatment of TRAPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Among 20 patients with active or recurrent chronic TRAPS in this open-label study, 19 (95 percent) experienced excellent symptom control with canakinumab (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> subcutaneously every four weeks, maximum dose 150 mg), typically within days of initiating therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Patients were treated for four months, and then treatment was withdrawn. All patients flared off of treatment, but, in each case, the initial drug response was recaptured by reinstitution of therapy. Disease recurrence appeared on average approximately 90 days after the last canakinumab dose, suggesting the possibility that less frequent dosing could be effective. This was confirmed in the long-term extension phase of the above in which patients tolerated dosing every eight weeks, either at the original dose or, in some cases, at a higher 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose. Gene expression studies supported the ability of canakinumab to reverse aberrant transcription associated with active disease, resulting in reduced expression of the gene encoding the defective TNF receptor itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>A potentially more cost-effective alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a> is anakinra, the recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist. Unlike canakinumab, which has a half-life of approximately 24 days, anakinra is short acting with a half-life of approximately four hours. Daily injection of anakinra has been found to be an effective alternative to control of TRAPS symptoms, offering the possibility for on-demand dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-periodic-syndrome-traps/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

We perform such screening at least every 6 to 12 months, using quantitative spot urine protein and creatinine measurement to screen for microalbumin, which is typically the earliest evidence of amyloidosis.
