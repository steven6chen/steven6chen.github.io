If there is a problem with the eustachian tube, the air pressure inside the middle ear won't be the same as the air pressure outside of it. This can damage the middle ear and cause ear pain, hearing loss, and other symptoms. &quot;Ear barotrauma&quot; is the medical term for when people have symptoms or damage in the middle ear because of air pressure differences.</p><p>Most eustachian tube problems are not serious. They usually last only a short time and get better on their own.</p><p>But eustachian tube problems sometimes lead to serious problems, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A middle ear infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A torn eardrum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss</p><p/><p>Long-term hearing loss from eustachian tube problems can also lead to language or speech problems in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196543204\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes eustachian tube problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common causes of eustachian tube problems are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Illnesses or conditions that make the eustachian tubes swollen or inflamed &ndash; These include colds, allergies, ear infections, or sinus infections. The sinuses are hollow areas in the bones of the face.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden air pressure changes &ndash; Sudden air pressure changes can happen when people fly in an airplane, scuba dive, or drive in the mountains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growths that block the eustachian tube</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being born with an abnormal eustachian tube</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196543211\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a eustachian tube problem?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms of a eustachian tube problem include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling pressure or fullness in the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble hearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ringing in the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196543218\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if your symptoms are severe, get worse, or if they don't go away after a few days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196543225\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a eustachian tube problem by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>If your symptoms are severe or last for a long time, your doctor or nurse might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you see a special kind of doctor called an ear, nose, and throat doctor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do tests to check your hearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do an imaging test &ndash; Imaging tests can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196543232\"><span class=\"h1\">How are eustachian tube problems treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what's causing the eustachian tube problem. Depending on your individual situation, your doctor might treat you with 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nose sprays</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antihistamines &ndash; These medicines are usually used to treat allergies.
