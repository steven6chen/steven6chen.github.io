The preoccupation with perceived flaws leads to repetitive behaviors (eg, checking their appearance in mirrors), which are difficult to control and are not pleasurable. BDD is common but usually under-recognized, causes clinically significant distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired functioning, and is often associated with suicidal ideation and behavior.</p><p>Patients with BDD may present to mental health professionals as well as other clinicians, such as dermatologists, plastic surgeons, primary care physicians, pediatricians, and dentists. Most patients seek nonpsychiatric cosmetic treatment (most commonly dermatologic or surgical) for their perceived physical defects; this treatment appears to be ineffective for most patients and can be risky for clinicians to provide. By contrast, pharmacotherapy (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored specifically to BDD are often efficacious.</p><p>This topic reviews the assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of BDD. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment and prognosis of BDD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body dysmorphic disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-dysmorphic-disorder-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body dysmorphic disorder: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133542\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial clinical evaluation of patients with a possible diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) includes a general psychiatric history, general medical history, and mental status examination, with emphasis upon suicidal ideation and behavior, delusional BDD symptoms, substance abuse, and depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. As with all psychiatric patients, a physical examination is indicated and typically is performed by the patient&rsquo;s primary care clinician or an internal medicine consultant; however, many patients refuse examinations because they do not want their bodies seen by others. Laboratory tests are obtained on the basis of the history and examination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067375845\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening instruments can facilitate diagnosis, but are not intended to diagnose BDD by themselves. For patients who screen positive, a clinical interview is required to establish the diagnosis. </p><p>We suggest the self-report Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F107014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107014 \">table 1</a>) to screen for BDD. This measure includes four questions and takes one to five minutes to administer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The Body Image Disturbance Questionnaire demonstrated strong psychometric properties in a nonclinical population, but it lacks sensitivity and specificity data. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133548\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical interview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with BDD do not spontaneously reveal their appearance concerns to clinicians because they are too embarrassed, fear being negatively judged (eg, considered vain), feel the clinician will not understand their appearance concerns, or do not know that body image concerns are treatable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. To detect BDD, clinicians usually must ask patients about specific BDD symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F96647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96647 \">table 2</a>). It is important to inquire about BDD symptoms in mental health, substance abuse, cosmetic surgery, and dermatology settings. &#160; &#160;</p><p>If patients acknowledge having appearance concerns, clinicians should invite patients to say more about their concerns (eg, what body areas the patient worries about), and probe for resulting distress and impairment in social, academic, occupational, and other aspects of functioning. Level of insight into the BDD beliefs should also be assessed. In addition, the appearance concerns should not be better explained by anorexia nervosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91103\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91103 \">table 3</a>), bulimia nervosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91105\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91105 \">table 4</a>), or another eating disorder. However, BDD and eating disorders can co-occur, in which case both disorders should be diagnosed, as each needs to be targeted in treatment. Diagnosis of eating disorders is discussed separately.

If BDD is accompanied by panic attacks, the DSM-5 panic attack specifier is included in the diagnosis (&ldquo;BDD with panic attacks&rdquo;). Information about panic attacks is discussed separately.

There are no specific criteria for BDD in ICD-10; rather, ICD-10 lists the disorder as a subtype of &ldquo;hypochondriacal disorder,&rdquo; which requires that patients persistently refuse to accept medical advice that there is no general medical disorder that accounts for the presenting symptoms. However, many patients are too embarrassed to spontaneously reveal their appearance preoccupations to clinicians, and thus may not have received medical advice. Patients may also lack access to health care. In addition, DSM-5 has eliminated the diagnosis of hypochondriasis.

As a result, BDD is usually misdiagnosed as another disorder or missed altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. BDD needs to be distinguished from the following conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/16,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20,21</a>]: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135218\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal appearance concerns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns with appearance are common in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. BDD is distinguished from normal concerns in that BDD is characterized by time-consuming and excessive appearance-related preoccupations and repetitive behaviors that are usually difficult to resist or control, and that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135224\"><span class=\"h2\">Obvious bodily defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clearly noticeable bodily defects<strong> </strong>are not diagnosed as BDD. However, skin picking caused by BDD can cause noticeable skin lesions and scarring; BDD is diagnosed in such cases. Skin picking (excoriation) disorder is discussed separately.

Dysmorphic concern is defined as an excessive concern with an imagined or slight flaw in physical appearance in addition to other excessive bodily concerns, such as concern with emitting a body odor and somatic complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Concern with emitting a body odor and somatic complaints are not widely recognized as symptoms of BDD. Also, the diagnosis of BDD requires the presence of repetitive behaviors that are performed in response to the appearance concerns as well as distress or impaired functioning that result from the appearance preoccupations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39059433\"><span class=\"h2\">Eating disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both BDD and eating disorders (eg, anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa) involve distorted body image and dissatisfaction with one&rsquo;s appearance. Other shared clinical features between eating disorders and some patients with BDD include weight concerns, dieting, and excessive exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>]. However, appearance concerns in BDD commonly involve more body areas, including the face or head, than is seen in eating disorders. If a patient is only concerned about being fat, and meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder, the eating disorder should be diagnosed and BDD should not. That said, eating disorders and BDD can co-occur; in such cases, both should be diagnosed. Diagnosis of eating disorders is discussed separately.

In addition, many patients with BDD meet diagnostic criteria for unipolar major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 6</a>); depressive symptoms in BDD often appear to be secondary to the distress and impairment that BDD causes. BDD is distinguished from major depressive disorder in that BDD is characterized by prominent preoccupation with appearance with specific body areas (eg, skin, hair, and nose) and<strong> </strong>excessive compulsive and repetitive behaviors; these preoccupations and behaviors are not a symptom of unipolar major depression. Clinicians should not assume that appearance concerns are due to a depressive syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients who meet criteria for both BDD and unipolar major depression should be diagnosed with both disorders. Diagnosing unipolar major depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H26342747\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Unipolar major depression'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135242\"><span class=\"h2\">Social anxiety disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Social anxiety disorder (formerly called social phobia) and BDD share anxiety about social situations, shame, and avoidance of others, as well as distress and functional impairment. In addition, fear of negative evaluation by others is a symptom of social anxiety disorder and often occurs in BDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, patients with social anxiety disorder fear negative evaluation of their behavior or what they say, whereas patients with BDD fear negative evaluation of their appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, repetitive behaviors occur in BDD but are not considered a key symptom of social anxiety disorder. Thus, if social anxiety is due solely to embarrassment and shame about perceived appearance flaws, and if diagnostic criteria for BDD are met, BDD should be diagnosed rather than social anxiety disorder. However, many patients manifest social anxiety and avoidance due to excessive appearance concerns as well as other social situations (eg, public speaking) and can therefore fulfill criteria for both disorders; in these cases, both disorders are diagnosed. Diagnosing social anxiety disorder is discussed separately.

However, if situations are avoided solely because of fears that others will see the person&rsquo;s perceived appearance defects, and if diagnostic criteria for BDD are met, BDD should be diagnosed rather than agoraphobia. In patients who meet diagnostic criteria for each disorder, both disorders should be diagnosed. Diagnosing agoraphobia is discussed separately.

However, the panic attacks in panic disorder occur in the absence of a cue (&quot;out of the blue&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. By contrast, the attacks in BDD occur in response to distress about physical appearance (eg, attacks are triggered by seeing one&rsquo;s reflection in a store window, or by the belief that others are staring at the patient). If the panic attacks are due solely to BDD, then &ldquo;BDD with panic attacks&rdquo; should be diagnosed rather than panic disorder, and a separate diagnosis of panic disorder should not be made. In patients who meet diagnostic criteria for each disorder, both disorders should be diagnosed. Diagnosing panic disorder is discussed separately.

However, the anxiety and worry in generalized anxiety disorder are not focused upon the perceived appearance flaws that occur with BDD. If anxiety and worry are due only to concerns and preoccupation with perceived appearance flaws, and if diagnostic criteria for BDD are met, BDD should be diagnosed rather than generalized anxiety disorder. In patients who meet diagnostic criteria for each disorder, both disorders should be diagnosed. Diagnosing generalized anxiety disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H448541462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135260\"><span class=\"h2\">Obsessive-compulsive disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BDD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are both characterized by recurrent, intrusive thoughts <span class=\"nowrap\">(obsessions/preoccupations)</span> that typically persist for hours each day, as well as compulsive behaviors (rituals) that are performed in response to obsessions; in both disorders the obsessions and compulsive behaviors are often difficult to resist and control, and they are not pleasurable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24</a>]. In addition, both BDD and OCD may be associated with shame such that symptoms are kept secret, even from clinicians. </p><p>However, BDD and OCD have several differences. Unlike OCD, BDD preoccupations and repetitive behaviors focus exclusively upon appearance. In addition, insight is poorer in BDD than OCD, and delusions related to the disorder (BDD or OCD), suicidal ideation and behavior, and comorbid unipolar major depression and possibly substance use disorder are more common in BDD than OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In patients who meet diagnostic criteria for each disorder, both disorders should be diagnosed. Diagnosing OCD is discussed separately.

Some patients with BDD also pull out or pluck their hair compulsively, but in BDD the intent is to improve a perceived defect in their appearance (eg, &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; facial hair or &ldquo;uneven&rdquo; eyebrows). When hair removal (tweezing, plucking, pulling, or other types of removal) is intended to improve perceived defects in the appearance of body or facial hair, and diagnostic criteria for BDD are fulfilled, BDD should be diagnosed rather than trichotillomania, and a separate diagnosis of trichotillomania should not be made. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39059628\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin picking (excoriation) disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin picking (excoriation) disorder is marked by recurrent skin picking that causes skin lesions as well as distress or impaired functioning as a result of the behavior; many patients with BDD also pick their skin. The two disorders are distinguished in that picking behavior in skin picking disorder is not intended to improve a perceived defect in physical appearance, whereas skin picking in BDD represents an attempt to improve perceived skin flaws. If the skin picking occurs in response to a preoccupation with nonexistent or slight defects in appearance of the skin, and other diagnostic criteria for BDD are met, BDD should be diagnosed rather than skin picking disorder, and a separate diagnosis of skin picking disorder should not be made. In addition, skin picking as a symptom of BDD can cause noticeable skin lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scarring; such cases can be diagnosed with BDD and are an exception to the rule that to diagnose BDD appearance defects must be nonexistent or only slight. </p><p>Diagnosing skin picking disorder is discussed separately.

However, the preoccupation in BDD is with being ugly, whereas the preoccupation in illness anxiety disorder is with having or acquiring a serious illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, BDD is always marked by distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychosocial dysfunction, whereas illness anxiety disorder is not. If the preoccupation is about perceived appearance flaws, and if diagnostic criteria for BDD are met, BDD should be diagnosed rather than illness anxiety disorder, and a separate diagnosis of illness anxiety order should not be made. Diagnosing illness anxiety disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis#H7947249\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Illness anxiety disorder: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135284\"><span class=\"h2\">Factitious disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factitious disorder and BDD may each involve self-induced injuries. However, patients with factitious disorder intend to injure themselves to deceive clinicians. By contrast, patients with BDD do not intend to injure themselves. As an example, BDD patients may compulsively pick their skin and produce skin lesions, but do not intend to injure their skin. In addition, some patients with BDD perform surgery on themselves in an attempt to improve the appearance of or remove the disliked body part. Unlike factitious disorder, these behaviors in BDD are motivated by an attempt to improve one&rsquo;s appearance and do not involve deception and falsification of symptoms. Diagnosis of factitious disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious disorder imposed on self (Munchausen syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135290\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychotic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with psychotic disorders (eg, delusional disorder or schizophrenia) and those with BDD may have delusions about their physical appearance and delusions of reference (false, fixed beliefs that ordinary events have a particular meaning for oneself). However, in patients with BDD, delusional beliefs and delusions of reference focus specifically upon perceived ugliness or imagined defects in one&rsquo;s physical appearance, related compulsive behaviors are present, and other psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations, grossly disorganized behavior, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms) are not present. If patients present with delusions that involve preoccupation with perceived appearance flaws, and if diagnostic criteria for BDD are met, BDD should be diagnosed rather than delusional disorder or other psychotic disorders. An overview of psychotic disorders is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults#H261969404\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and initial management of psychosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Primary psychiatric illnesses'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H222951\"><span class=\"h2\">Gender dysphoria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gender dysphoria and BDD are both marked by a strong desire to change physical features that are distressing, as well as resulting functional impairment. However, the focus of gender dysphoria is usually upon one&rsquo;s primary and secondary sex characteristics, which reflect one&rsquo;s natal sex and are incongruent with one&rsquo;s expressed or experienced gender. If concerns with other body areas are present, it is because they reflect the person&rsquo;s natal sex. BDD should not be diagnosed in patients who are preoccupied with only their primary and secondary sex characteristics or with other aspects of appearance that reflect their natal sex, and who meet other diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H136029\"><span class=\"h2\">Olfactory reference syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In both BDD and olfactory reference syndrome (false belief that one emits a foul odor), patients are preoccupied with a perceived somatic abnormality, engage in repetitive behaviors in response to the preoccupation, and often avoid social situations because of embarrassment and shame; in addition, most patients manifest poor insight or delusions regarding the somatic concerns, and there may be fears of negative evaluation by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The two disorders are distinguished in that patients with olfactory reference syndrome are preoccupied with emitting a foul or offensive body odor, which is not observed in BDD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135314\"><span class=\"h2\">Body identity integrity disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Body identity integrity disorder (apotemnophilia or xenomelia) is not classified as a disorder in DSM-5. However, it is sometimes mentioned in the scientific literature and the popular press. Body identity integrity disorder and BDD each involve discomfort with a body part and can involve surgery to remove the disliked body part [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, patients with body identity integrity disorder experience a mismatch between their bodily identity and their actual anatomy, believe they would be happier living as an amputee, and thus want to amputate one or more healthy limbs. This desire to amputate a limb because it is not congruent with the person&rsquo;s identity is not observed in BDD. Patients with body integrity identity disorder do not perceive the appearance of the limb as defective and are not ashamed of the limb; rather, they view the limb as incongruent with their identity. In addition, body integrity identity disorder appears to be a rare disorder, whereas BDD is common. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients can benefit from reading about their illness at websites such as those maintained by the <a href=\"http://iocdf.org/&amp;token=6tF+hpDIhXWnuNKBvcHLg180bYa1DGFir1MOOyXGzMk=&amp;TOPIC_ID=96883\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">International OCD Foundation</a><u> and the author of this article</u><u> (</u><a href=\"http://katharinephillipsmd.com/&amp;token=msaAgDuZ2kXPgplkr1gPI598lvheUcJxy7lYe4RtHgHVYEDOsUbP0NCtuM8JGcuD&amp;TOPIC_ID=96883\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">KatharinePhillipsMD.com</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135363\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial clinical evaluation of patients with a possible diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) includes a psychiatric history, general medical history, mental status examination (emphasizing suicidal ideation and behavior, delusional BDD symptoms, substance abuse, and depressive symptoms) and a physical examination. Many patients refuse examinations because they do not want their bodies seen by others. Laboratory tests are obtained on the basis of the history and examination.
