The number of perioperative patients with OSA is likely to continue to increase in parallel with the increase in obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. OSA leads to perioperative morbidity, such that prompt recognition and treatment is prudent to offset postoperative complications. While a significant proportion of patients who present for surgery have a known diagnosis of OSA, more than one-half do not have a diagnosis in place resulting in challenges in management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The postoperative management of patients with OSA (including those with obesity hypoventilation syndrome [OHS]) is reviewed here.

Most events (&gt;80 percent) occur in the first 24 hours, such that vigilant monitoring particularly in the early postoperative period is critical. Further details regarding the incidence and type of complications that occur postoperatively in patients with OSA are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea#H15227501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical risk and the preoperative evaluation and management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea&quot;, section on 'Perioperative risks'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3723768618\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General strategies including lateral or semi-upright positioning, pain control, and judicious fluid management apply to all patients with known or suspected OSA throughout their postoperative course.</p><p>Our management strategy is keeping with guidelines issued by experts including the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/7-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-15</a>]. General recommendations include maintaining a high index of suspicion for OSA in the perioperative patient, careful use of sedative medications including opioids, vigilant monitoring for upper airway obstruction, and an integrated team approach to perioperative management. There is little direct evidence that these precautions improve outcomes, so recommendations are generally based upon indirect evidence, clinical rationale, and expert opinion. Postoperative care should begin in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and continue throughout the patient's stay (if hospitalization is warranted) through recovery at home, since OSA may worsen postoperatively for several days after surgery until normal sleep architecture is restored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2365385829\"><span class=\"h2\">Upright positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the supine position worsens OSA, it is prudent to maintain postoperative OSA patients in the upright or semi-upright position, if not contraindicated by the surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The lateral position is an alternative if a semi-upright position is not feasible or tolerated by the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Sleep position'</a>.)</p><p>Data supporting non-supine positions in this population come partly from studies of nonsurgical patients with OSA that have shown that sleeping in a non-supine position improves the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxyhemoglobin saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], while a change in position from lateral to supine increases the passive pharyngeal collapsibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A prospective cohort study in postoperative patients reported that postoperative patients spent a significant proportion of time in the supine position and that the AHI was significantly greater while in this position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a randomized crossover study of 55 postpartum patients with OSA, 45 degree elevation of the upper body after delivery compared with the supine position reduced the AHI (7.7&plusmn;2.2 per hour versus 4.5&plusmn;1.4 per hour) during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The upright position may also potentially help reduce rostral fluid shift and thereby reduce postoperative airway obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H3589245855\" class=\"local\">'Fluid management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1994288043\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whenever feasible, we prefer opioid-sparing analgesic techniques to avoid or minimize the postoperative use of opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. This approach is based upon the rationale that opioid use increases the incidence of oxygen desaturation and episodes of apnea in patients with severe OSA and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), particularly in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Opioid-sparing techniques are especially useful in patients who complain of pain when aroused but are otherwise sedated (ie, they have concurrent high pain and sedation scores). This &quot;pain-sedation mismatch&quot; identifies patients with OSA who are at risk for airway obstruction or respiratory failure, and should also be considered in determining the level of monitoring needed if opioids are used in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H544953932\" class=\"local\">'Discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit'</a> below.)</p><p>Opioid-sparing techniques include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonopioid analgesics include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. Analgesic adjuvants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> may also decrease postoperative opioid requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of regional analgesia with local anesthetic (eg, peripheral nerve blocks, epidural analgesia) may also decrease or eliminate the need for opioid administration. Peripheral nerve blocks with long-acting local anesthetics or infusions via continuous catheters may provide analgesia for several hours to days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H795596357\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Peripheral nerve blocks'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional recommendations for the management of postoperative pain in the obese patient are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient#H2284147197\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the obese patient&quot;, section on 'Management of postoperative pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p>While these techniques decrease the need for opioids, some patients need additional analgesia, which may be provided with low doses of systemic or neuraxial opioids. A low-dose epidural infusion with a lipophilic opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sufentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sufentanil</a>) may cause less respiratory depression than intravenous opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>]. Patients who receive epidural or intrathecal bolus doses of more hydrophilic opioids (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>) should be monitored for delayed respiratory depression for 24 hours after the dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The incidence of cardiorespiratory complications after administration of neuraxial opioids in patients with OSA is unknown and the literature on this issue is limited. A 2013 systematic review included five studies (two retrospective chart reviews and three case reports) and 121 patients with OSA who had received neuraxial opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Six major cardiorespiratory complications were reported among five (4.1 percent) patients, including three deaths, one cardiorespiratory arrest, and two episodes of severe respiratory depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H795596143\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Monitoring the patient who has received neuraxial analgesia'</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the route of opioid administration, the lowest effective dose should be used with vigilant monitoring for respiratory depression. The majority of respiratory depression events occur within 24 hours of surgery, with one closed claims analysis concluding that most events were probably preventable with increased vigilance and monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, vigilance should be maintained throughout the patient's postoperative recovery period. After leaving a closely monitored environment (eg, PACU or intensive care unit), continuous infusions of opioids is contraindicated when patient-controlled analgesia is used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H795594284\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Patient-controlled analgesia'</a>.) </p><p>Concurrent administration of sedatives (eg, anxiolytics) should be avoided, if feasible, in patients with OSA who are receiving systemic opioids, to minimize the risk of respiratory depression and upper airway collapse. Clinicians should anticipate respiratory depression when these drug combinations are used, by providing more intensive monitoring and ensuring the availability of specific antagonists (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> [for opioids], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> [for benzodiazepines]).</p><p>The interactions between nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep disruption from untreated OSA, postoperative pain, opioid analgesia, and the role of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy are unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. On one hand, sleep disruption and intermittent hypoxia may worsen postoperative pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and sleep restoration with continuous PAP (CPAP) treatment in OSA patients may reduce pain sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In contrast, a retrospective study of bariatric patients with OSA reported that chronic intermittent hypoxemia was associated with reduced opioid consumption in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Further research in this field is necessary to explore these interactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3589245855\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many experts believe that patients with OSA may benefit from a restrictive or goal-directed strategy for perioperative fluid therapy, and from fluids with relatively lower salt content (ie, Ringer's Lactate or Plasmalyte) rather than normal saline. </p><p>The rationale for this approach is based upon the observations that intravenous fluids with a high salt content (eg, normal saline), the supine position, and compression stockings, all common in the perioperative period, may together potentially result in rostral fluid shifts, thereby predisposing to airway collapse in the postoperative OSA patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Postoperatively, and when feasible, we prefer that patients with OSA be positioned upright or semi-upright to ameliorate this phenomenon. Whether adopting this approach leads to improved outcomes or can be easily treated by the use of crystalloids with a lower salt content or with CPAP is unknown. Further details regarding restrictive and goal-directed fluid management and the pathogenesis of rostral fluid shifts are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraoperative-fluid-management#H2410959413\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraoperative fluid management&quot;, section on 'Restrictive (zero-balance) strategy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraoperative-fluid-management#H626508222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraoperative fluid management&quot;, section on 'Goal-directed fluid therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H175956489\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Rostral fluid displacement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1087034143\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive airway pressure therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1121033277\"><span class=\"h3\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine use of postoperative noninvasive PAP therapy, typically CPAP, depends upon whether or not patients have a known diagnosis of OSA and are adherent to therapy preoperatively.</p><p>We suggest the routine use of PAP therapy postoperatively in patients with a known diagnosis of OSA who are compliant preoperatively with PAP. For patients without a diagnosis of OSA, or those who have diagnosed OSA but are noncompliant with or intolerant of PAP therapy, we suggest using PAP selectively, when hypoxemia, airway obstruction, apnea, or hypoventilation occur. PAP therapy is preferably started in the PACU and continued on the floor through recovery and discharge home. PAP should be in place whenever the patient is in bed, since postoperative patients often sleep during the day. While on PAP therapy, it is prudent that patients be monitored for oxygenation and ventilation as outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H1530071754\" class=\"local\">'Post-anesthesia care unit management'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who are intolerant of PAP therapy in the PACU or on the floor can be successfully managed with maneuvers such as adjusting the mask (eg, full-face mask if there is either nasal packing or a nasogastric tube in place) and adding heated humidification and a pressure ramp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. Thus, using PAP requires that nurses and respiratory therapists be available and trained to assist patients so that compliance can be achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H284801771\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Patient-device interface'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Accessory features'</a>.)</p><p>The use of CPAP seems to be safe in the perioperative setting. Despite concerns that PAP therapy might lead to anastomotic leaks after upper gastrointestinal surgery, in a systematic review of 13 observational studies (5500 patients) who underwent gastric bypass surgery, postoperative noninvasive positive ventilation was not associated with increased risk of anastomotic dehiscence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Similarly, another review reported that only one-third to two-thirds of patients who were on home CPAP received postoperative CPAP during their hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4088475045\"><span class=\"h3\">Known OSA on treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients on home PAP should be instructed to bring their devices to the hospital for continuation in the postoperative period to facilitate use. PAP therapy, typically CPAP, should be initiated in the PACU (if feasible) at the level previously prescribed. However, adjustments may need to be made to the settings to account for perioperative changes such as facial swelling, upper airway edema, fluid shifts, pharmacotherapy, and respiratory function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. If the previously prescribed level is not known, it is reasonable to begin CPAP at an empiric level of 8 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and then titrate the level until apneas, episodes of oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and snoring are eliminated. Alternatively, auto-titrating CPAP is increasingly being used to eliminate the need for manual titration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/38,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41,42</a>].

However, even in these populations, evidence of improved outcomes with the routine use of CPAP perioperatively is limited, with mixed outcomes from studies that use both preoperative and postoperative PAP support rather than either method alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/14,38,41,43-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,38,41,43-50</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One meta-analysis of six studies reported that there was no difference in postoperative complications between patients receiving CPAP or no CPAP; although postoperative AHI was lower and there was a trend towards shorter hospital length of stay (0.4 days) in those using CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Switching to BPAP (with a <span class=\"nowrap\">spontaneous/timed</span> mode) is appropriate in those who develop hypoventilation as a complication of their surgery. For patients on oral devices for OSA treatment, the device should be applied in the PACU, if feasible; PAP is an alternative.

Most clinicians choose CPAP as the preferred empiric mode of noninvasive PAP for patients with OSA with the sole goal being maintenance of upper airway patency. However, BPAP may be more appropriate in those with obesity, or medication-related hypoventilation. BPAP settings are empirically adjusted based on oxygenation (by oximetry) and patient comfort with PAP, respiratory effort, and presence of breakthrough snoring. Auto-titrating PAP (APAP) may be an option for those not tolerating CPAP with several studies reporting successful application of empiric APAP in the perioperative setting with improved saturation and AHI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/38,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41,42</a>]. </p><p>It is uncertain whether patients with undiagnosed or untreated OSA who have not used CPAP preoperatively benefit from its postoperative use; literature on this issue is limited.

Postoperative areas should be prepared and equipped to detect respiratory depression early and intervene with airway and ventilatory support, and antagonist medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a>), as needed. Most patients should be monitored for at least 60 minutes after usual PACU discharge criteria are met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3552247253\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen therapy is routine for adults in most postoperative recovery areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, compared with those without OSA, the incidence of perioperative peripheral oxygen desaturations and respiratory complications are higher in patients with OSA, with the highest risk in those who have obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and the overlap syndrome (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] plus OSA). Thus, oxygen therapy is often prolonged, and there is consequently a greater need for close monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry than for patients without OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The purpose of oxygen supplementation is to eliminate perioperative desaturation. However, the risk of oxygen delivery in patients with OSA is that it may worsen hypoventilation, particularly in patients with concurrent OHS and COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. A strategy of titrated low-flow oxygen that achieves adequate oxygenation (eg, &gt;90 percent) and avoids acute hypercapnia from hypoventilation is prudent (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure#H933406661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure&quot;, section on 'Titration of oxygen'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome#H3944558199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of the obesity hypoventilation syndrome&quot;, section on 'Oxygen alone'</a>). In support of this strategy, a prospective randomized-controlled trial of postoperative patients with newly diagnosed untreated OSA reported that compared with no oxygen, oxygen therapy via nasal prongs decreased the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and improved oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, 11 percent of patients showed elevated arterial carbon dioxide, indicating respiratory depression. Thus, additional methods for detecting hypoventilation should be used for patients with OSA. (See <a href=\"#H3940390907\" class=\"local\">'Ventilatory monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Supplemental oxygen in the PACU is gradually decreased until the patient is able to maintain adequate oxygenation on room air when left unstimulated. Patients with OSA may only become hypoxemic when sleeping, so it is best to observe the patient in a quiet location. Patients who desaturate when left undisturbed should either remain in the PACU or be monitored by continuous pulse oximetry when transferred to the hospital ward.
