The infiltration usually presents as progressive thyroid enlargement that is painless, firm, and bilateral, and may be confused with goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), nontoxic multinodular goiter, subacute thyroiditis, infectious thyroiditis or occasionally thyroid cancer or lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroiditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical course and pathologic findings of the most common forms of infiltrative thyroid disease, excluding those of autoimmune, infectious or malignant origin, are reviewed here. Most of these diseases involve other organs, but the focus here will be on the thyroid manifestations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1723875\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infiltrative thyroid diseases are rare. Painless, progressive enlargement of the thyroid is the most common presentation of infiltrative thyroid disease. Changes in thyroid function tests are less commonly seen, although infiltration of the thyroid can be associated with hypothyroidism.</p><p>We routinely measure thyroid function tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and free thyroxine [T4]) when thyroid enlargement or nodular thyroid disease is noted on physical examination. Many thyroid experts also check serum thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies in patients with diffuse thyroid enlargement (regardless of the TSH level) to confirm the diagnosis of chronic thyroiditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults#H6509061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;, section on 'Approach to evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>We perform thyroid ultrasonography to assess the morphology of the thyroid gland when infiltration is suspected. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a suspicious nodule or expanding mass in the thyroid may be considered to further evaluate the variable pathology of this entity. The presence of a high titer of TPO antibodies does not negate the need for FNA biopsy of a thyroid nodule or expanding mass in patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.</p><p>There are no clinical trials on the efficacy of therapy for infiltrative thyroid disease because of the rarity of this condition. When infiltrative thyroid disease occurs as a manifestation of generalized disease, the underlying disease should be treated. Patients with hypothyroidism require treatment with thyroid hormone replacement (T4 [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>]) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>). Surgical intervention is often necessary when there are signs of obstruction from tracheal or esophageal compression. Treatment of the individual forms of infiltrative thyroid disease is reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RIEDEL'S THYROIDITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Riedel's thyroiditis (fibrous thyroiditis) was originally described in 1896 by Riedel as a &quot;specific inflammation of mysterious nature producing an iron hard tumefaction of the thyroid.&quot; This disorder is a fibrotic process associated with a mononuclear cell inflammation that extends beyond the thyroid into the perithyroidal soft tissue. The perithyroidal fibrosis can involve the parathyroid glands causing hypoparathyroidism, the recurrent laryngeal nerves causing hoarseness, the trachea causing compression, the mediastinum, and the anterior chest wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In contrast, other infiltrative and inflammatory conditions of the thyroid do not extend beyond the thyroid capsule.</p><p>Riedel's thyroiditis is extremely rare, with an outpatient incidence of 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">06/100,000</span> and prevalence of 0.05 percent or less of surgical thyroid diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women are four times more likely than men to be affected, and it most commonly occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of Riedel's thyroiditis is not known. Although Riedel's disease is often believed to be the local involvement of the thyroid in a systemic disease, multifocal fibrosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], there is limited evidence suggesting that Riedel's thyroiditis is associated with autoimmune disease or a primary fibrotic process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The presence of mononuclear cells and vasculitis within the fibrous tissue and of high serum antithyroid antibody concentrations in many patients support the concept of an autoimmune mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the elevated thyroid antibodies may be a reaction to antigens released from destroyed thyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>No etiologic relationship to drugs has been identified in patients with isolated Riedel's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It seems likely that multifocal fibrosclerosis is a primary fibrotic disorder, with fibroblast proliferation induced by cytokines produced by B or T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Riedel's thyroiditis may occur with other fibrosing conditions such as retroperitoneal fibrosis, fibrosing mediastinitis, sclerosing cholangitis, pancreatitis, lacrimal fibrosis, orbital pseudotumor fibrosis, and tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions of the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Riedel's thyroiditis may occur as part of IgG4-related systemic disease. The hallmarks of IgG4-related systemic disease are lymphoplasmacytic tissue infiltration of mainly IgG4-positive plasma cells and small lymphocytes accompanied by fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, and elevated serum levels of IgG4. Excessive numbers of IgG4-positive plasma cells have been identified in thyroidectomy samples from three patients with Riedel's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History and physical examination</strong> &ndash; Common clinical features are those similar to the presentation of thyroid malignancy. Patients present with a slowly growing, painless goiter; they may have anterior neck pressure, dysphagia, hoarseness, dyspnea, or hypoparathyroidism if the process has extended beyond the thyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/1,2,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,12,13</a>]. Local obstructive pneumonia and superior vena cava syndrome have been reported as presenting symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although only approximately one-third of patients may experience hypothyroidism, many patients with Riedel's thyroiditis experience generalized malaise and fatigue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On physical examination, the size of the thyroid gland varies from small to large. Usually both lobes are enlarged, but the enlargement may be asymmetric and occasionally is limited to one lobe. The goiter is typically nontender, &quot;stony&quot; hard, and densely adherent to the adjacent soft tissue and muscles, including the sternocleidomastoid, sternohyoid, and sternothyroid muscles; as a result, the thyroid gland often moves poorly with swallowing. The fibrotic process may encase the esophagus and trachea, and adjacent lymph nodes may be enlarged, raising the suspicion of cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The findings on physical examination alone are sufficient to establish the diagnosis in most patients. A careful search for other physical signs of systemic fibrosclerotic disease should then be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thyroid function tests</strong> &ndash; The majority of patients with Riedel's thyroiditis have normal serum thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations at presentation. The remainder (25 to 32 percent) have subclinical or overt hypothyroidism due to nonfunctioning fibrous infiltration and thyroid parenchymal destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/4,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,15</a>]. Up to two-thirds of patients have elevated serum thyroid autoantibody concentrations, but the titer may be less than that seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other laboratory tests</strong> &ndash; Serum calcium and phosphorus should be measured to identify those with coexistent hypoparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/1,2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,13</a>]. The white blood cell count is usually normal. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be normal or elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging</strong> &ndash; Thyroid radionuclide imaging reveals a heterogeneous pattern of isotope uptake or very low uptake. The extent of the fibrosis is best defined by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows focal homogenous hypointensity in T1 and T2 weighted images. These imaging modalities can show that the lesions may infiltrate the thyroid, peripheral organs, and the vasculature of the neck. Ultrasonography can reveal focal, hypoechoic lesions that may infiltrate the perithyroid muscles, and color-flow Doppler shows absence of vascular flow in the Riedel's regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In two cases, ultrasound showed thyroid tissue circumferentially surrounding the carotid artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Ultrasound elastography showed heterogeneity of the stiffness values of the thyroid parenchyma between 21 and 281 kPa. On fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scans, Riedel's thyroiditis is hypermetabolic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The abnormal FDG metabolism may track with clinical activity of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytology</strong> &ndash; Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy may reveal mononuclear cells and fibrous tissue, but often no thyroid epithelial cells are obtained. The differential diagnosis based on FNA includes subacute thyroiditis, a fibrosing variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, radiation-induced thyroiditis, and malignancy, specifically a paucicellular variant of anaplastic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In many patients, the specimen is inadequate and the diagnosis can be established pathologically only by open biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathology</strong> &ndash; Pathologic examination of resected thyroid tissue reveals hard, white, avascular tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60341\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60341 \">picture 1</a>). Histologic sections from lesions early in the disease will show intense infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Later in the disease process, specimens will show infiltration of the thyroid with dense hyalinized fibrous tissue that contains few lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils and almost no thyroid follicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73174 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The fibrosis extends beyond the thyroid into adipose tissue, muscle, and nerves, and may encase vessels, parathyroid glands, the trachea, and the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53239\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53239 \">picture 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The tissue planes are obliterated, making surgical extirpation virtually impossible. The pathology should confirm the absence of a granulomatous reaction and cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There may be an associated phlebitis with thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This occlusive phlebitis results from a diffuse infiltration of the walls of small and medium sized veins by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Adenomas or cysts (degenerative or hemorrhagic) occur within the fibrous mass in approximately 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thyroid fibrosis is also seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and an infiltrating variant form of papillary cancer, but the extent of the fibrosis in these disorders is much less, and it does not extend beyond the thyroid as it does in Riedel's thyroiditis. The paucicellular variant of anaplastic thyroid cancer has been described that may mimic Riedel's thyroiditis because it is characterized by an infiltrative, hard, fibrotic thyroid mass that may extend into perithyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; however, scattered within the fibrous tissue are spindle cells that obliterate large blood vessels and contain epithelial-cell markers detected by immunohistochemistry.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Riedel's thyroiditis can occur in association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and, as noted above, some patients with Riedel's thyroiditis have elevated serum antithyroid antibody concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and lymphocytic infiltration may be seen in thyroid biopsies. The following findings help distinguish between the disorders, although their pathogenic importance is not known.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venulitis and fibrous tissue invasion into perithyroidal tissues are features of Riedel's thyroiditis that are not seen in the fibrous variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. H&uuml;rthle cells, while frequently seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, are absent from Riedel's thyroiditis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotyping demonstrates a predominance of lambda light chain-containing lymphocytes in Riedel's thyroiditis and kappa light chain-containing lymphocytes in Hashimoto's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost half of the plasma cells in Riedel's thyroiditis produce IgA, while in Hashimoto's thyroiditis most plasma cells produce IgG and only approximately 15 percent produce IgA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, there are several reports of other autoimmune disorders, such as Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes, pernicious anemia, and Graves' disease associated with Riedel's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Riedel's thyroiditis has rarely been reported in association with subacute thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/16,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,29,30</a>]. These patients are typically female and do not have thyroid autoantibodies present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Untreated, Riedel's thyroiditis is usually slowly progressive and may stabilize or even regress spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Mortality is typically attributed to recurrent pneumonia due to bronchial compression and dyspnea. Treatment is aimed at both hypothyroidism, if present, and the manifestations related to fibrosclerosis. Hypothyroidism should be treated with T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>), but it rarely has any effect on the goiter or the progressive spread of fibrosclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no clinical trials on the efficacy of medical therapy for Riedel's thyroiditis because of the rarity of this condition. Nevertheless, empiric therapy may be indicated with the progressive perithyroidal infiltration, fibrosis, and potentially life-threatening destruction of local structures. Treatment with glucocorticoids has reduced thyroid enlargement and induced softening of the neck mass in a few patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/13,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26</a>], especially when used early in the course of the disease. Treatment with glucocorticoids is typically long-term, as disease recurrence has been seen when doses of steroids are tapered.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> has also been used successfully in the treatment of Riedel's thyroiditis. In one series of four patients who had progressive symptomatic disease despite glucocorticoid therapy and surgery, tamoxifen resulted in both subjective and objective improvement in all, including at least a 50 percent reduction in the size of the goiter. The mechanism of tamoxifen's effect is unknown, but may relate to the reduction of cytokine-mediated (namely transforming growth factor beta [TGF-beta]) fibroblast proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Doses of 10 to 20 mg twice daily have been used to treat Riedel's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil have been used as therapy for disorders associated with systemic fibrosclerosis (IgG4-releated disease) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease#H43795020\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>). In one case report, a woman with Riedel's thyroiditis who did not have a response to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> was subsequently treated with 1 gm mycophenolate twice daily and 100 mg of prednisone daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. She had subjective improvement of compressive symptoms and an objective decrease in thyroid mass. In another case report, a woman who had no improvement with glucocorticoids and eventual progression after two years of tamoxifen had symptomatic, biochemical, and radiological improvement after treatment with intravenous rituximab (375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> monthly for three months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The improvement has persisted for 14 months.</p><p>Surgery is indicated to relieve tracheal or esophageal compression or to rule out malignancy. The operation should be limited to relieving the obstruction, eg, by excising a wedge of thyroid isthmus to relieve tracheal compression. Extensive resection, ie, total thyroidectomy, is not indicated because of the lack of resection planes and risk of injury to adjacent adhering structures, including the parathyroid glands and the recurrent laryngeal nerves.</p><p>Low dose radiation therapy has been used in cases that are refractory to other treatments.</p><p>Multifocal fibrosclerosis in the retroperitoneum causing ureteral obstruction has been treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> pulse therapy in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, the effectiveness of this regimen has not been studied in patients with Riedel's thyroiditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">AMYLOID GOITER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amyloidosis is a diverse group of diseases characterized by extracellular tissue deposition of a fibrous insoluble protein generically termed amyloid. In the thyroid, amyloid is most often detected in the stroma in medullary thyroid cancers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>). Rarely, it is diffusely deposited in the thyroid in patients with systemic amyloidosis, sometimes causing goiter and occasionally hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>There are two major forms of systemic amyloidosis: primary and secondary. Primary (AL) amyloidosis is a plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by the tissue deposition of fragments of monoclonal light chains, while secondary or reactive (AA) amyloidosis is associated with chronic inflammatory states and tissue deposition of fragments of serum amyloid A protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

In familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), one study showed that 3 of 1100 patients were afflicted with amyloid goiter, while another center reported 10 of 22 hemodialysis patients with FMF were shown to have amyloid goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amyloid goiter is characterized by gradual, painless, diffuse, firm thyroid enlargement, occasionally sufficient to cause tracheal compression, sometimes with chronic hoarseness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/39,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,42</a>]. Most symptomatic patients present with a neck mass that is rapidly growing over weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], which can be misdiagnosed as a thyroid malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infiltrative-thyroid-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Painless, progressive enlargement of the thyroid is the most common presentation of infiltrative thyroid disease but compressive symptoms may occur, depending on the underlying etiology. (See <a href=\"#H1723875\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in thyroid function tests are uncommon, although infiltration of the thyroid can be associated with hypothyroidism. Thyroid function tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and free thyroxine [T4]) should be measured when thyroid enlargement or nodular thyroid disease is noted on physical examination. Thyroid ultrasonography can be used to assess the morphology of the thyroid. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a suspicious nodule or expanding mass in the thyroid may be considered to further evaluate the variable pathology of this entity. (See <a href=\"#H1723875\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hypothyroidism require treatment with thyroid hormone replacement (T4 [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>]). Surgical intervention is often necessary when there are signs of obstruction from tracheal or esophageal compression. When infiltrative thyroid disease occurs as a manifestation of generalized disease, the underlying disease should be treated. (See <a href=\"#H1723875\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most infiltrative diseases that affect the thyroid limit their involvement to thyroid tissue with the exception of Riedel's thyroiditis, where the inflammation and fibrosis extends in to the surrounding tissues. The symptoms of Riedel's include obstructive or restrictive neck symptoms, sometimes associated with hypocalcemia from infiltrative destruction of the parathyroid glands.
