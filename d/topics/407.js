Adherence to treatment is critical for cure of individual patients, controlling spread of infection, and minimizing the development of drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Issues related to adherence to treatment of drug-sensitive TB in adults will be reviewed here. The clinical approach to treatment of TB is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-uninfected adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-infected-adults-initiation-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-drug-resistant-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES OF ADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incomplete adherence to treatment has been identified as the most serious problem in tuberculosis (TB) control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and a major obstacle to the elimination of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one retrospective study including 184 patients with TB in New York City (nearly half of whom were nonadherent), the nonadherent patients took longer to convert sputum to negative culture results (254 versus 64 days), were more likely to acquire drug resistance (relative risk 5.6), and required longer treatment regimens (560 versus 324 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Adherence to tuberculosis treatment can be particularly challenging; the duration of treatment is long (usually six months or longer), combination therapy is required, and side effects may be unpleasant. Cost of medications (even relatively small copays or deductibles) can be a serious barrier to adherence if not covered by the public health system. Furthermore, patients often experience rapid improvement in symptoms, which may obfuscate the importance of continuing prolonged treatment with drugs that may be perceived as unnecessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors affecting adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful treatment among patients with TB may be influenced by several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access to medical care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of medications and their side effects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Availability and cost of medications (to the patient)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dosing frequency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal and social characteristics of patients and providers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cultural beliefs of patients and providers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cultural sensitivity of providers and the relationship between provider and patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of training among providers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantity and quality of information available about TB</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extent of patient knowledge about TB and the importance of completing a lengthy treatment regimen even if feeling well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Commitment of public health system to TB treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Political, legislative, and economic factors</p><p/><p>Healthcare providers must evaluate potential obstacles to treatment and facilitate educating and supporting patients to take medications as prescribed.

No single group has been consistently identified to be at risk for nonadherence; the following patients may benefit from close monitoring:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have previously failed to complete a regimen of antituberculous therapy (for treatment of active disease or latent infection) or who have had difficulty complying with other medical therapies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physically, emotionally, or mentally challenged patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients unable to pay for medications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients actively abusing drugs, alcohol, or other addictive substances</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not believe they have tuberculosis or who do not understand the importance of treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have cultural beliefs opposing treatment</p><p/><p>In one series of patients with tuberculosis in New York City, an increased rate of nonadherence was observed among African-Americans, injection drug users, homeless individuals, alcoholics, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Multivariate analysis noted that the only consistent predictors of nonadherence were injection drug use and homelessness.</p><p>Physicians and other healthcare workers also have difficulties with adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment strategies should employ a patient-centered case management approach, using directly observed therapy (DOT) as a tool to maximize adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Case management with DOT (at least at the start of treatment) using trained nurses has become a standard of care in tuberculosis (TB) control and prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other strategies include provision of free medications, use of multidrug combination therapy, patient education, and vouchers for transportation and other needs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535488155\"><span class=\"h2\">Comprehensive case management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using this strategy, teams of personnel assume responsibility for case management, continuity of care, and follow-up. Each TB case or suspect is assigned a public health case manager who is responsible for coordinating all aspects of that patient&rsquo;s care, usually giving the patient a major voice in deciding how care is administered. Description of this strategy are contained in the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/ssmodules/pdfs/module6v2.pdf&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsQulwAmMHHLqr1ByRDOU5YDsz7wHHD8PPLKdKJlTufTzb9OWSzSVdRN3gXtJqVYc1g==&amp;TOPIC_ID=8019\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">module</a> on tuberculosis: &quot;Managing Tuberculosis Patients and Improving Adherence&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/cdc/tb/nursing-case-protocols.pdf&amp;token=64bi0iObL+IZDjqd7RhXQM72LEBac6m9expaePbR4f4gJXMP31VD8zfYZSvgn+ZOVSPQhChieyhVZEaWuFyUD9IZ/B6l8h52bPYE64KrM2c=&amp;TOPIC_ID=8019\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">protocol</a> for case management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Directly observed therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Directly observed therapy (DOT) involves observation by a healthcare provider watching as a patient swallows each dose of antituberculous medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. This may be done in a clinic setting or in the community. DOT should be used for patients with the conditions summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109545 \">table 1</a>). In addition, we are in agreement with the 2016 American Thoracic Society, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, which suggest using DOT (rather than self-administered therapy) for routine treatment of patients for all forms of tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Decisions regarding use of DOT may be based on local rates of treatment completion and individual patient circumstances. In many programs, patients are observed taking their medications on weekdays and self-administer medications on weekends.</p><p>DOT programs require a significant commitment of resources but have been shown to be very effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. One study of the community-based DOT program in Baltimore, Maryland, illustrated the benefits derived from DOT; during the 1980s and early 1990s, Baltimore experienced a substantial decline in TB incidence while TB incidence elsewhere in the United States increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In-person DOT has been the model for TB treatment; however, it is resource intensive and may itself be a barrier to successful treatment in some cases. The growth of mobile technology has created new opportunities to deliver care for patients with TB. Numerous pilot studies in high- and low-resource settings have shown that <span class=\"nowrap\">video/mobile</span> DOT <span class=\"nowrap\">(VDOT/MDOT)</span> is feasible, cost-effective, and effective for select groups of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p>Some studies have observed that DOT did not alter rates of cure, treatment interruption, or other outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. A systematic review of the effectiveness of DOT including 34 studies found that, while overall rates of treatment failure and relapse were low, considerable variability among studies existed in actual compliance and follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A subsequent systematic review concluded that DOT did not offer benefit over self-administered care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fixed-dose combination therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of fixed-dose combinations of antituberculous drugs simplifies therapy and reduces the possibility of missing a component of a multidrug regimen. These preparations reduce the likelihood of acquired drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Combination drugs that are available in the United States include Rifamate (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>) and Rifater (isoniazid, rifampin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1914568\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education that is culturally and linguistically appropriate (in combination with other interventions) is essential for ensuring adherence. The use of simple terms together with both written and pictorial materials are all important. Educational efforts should be directed at identifying the patient's perception of barriers to adherence and at building trust with the healthcare delivery system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Incentives and enablers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incentives and enablers are used to encourage treatment adherence. Incentives are small &quot;rewards&quot; given to patients who adhere to the prescribed treatment regimen and maintain regular clinic visits. Enablers allow the patient to receive treatment more easily (eg, bus tickets or other means of transportation).</p><p>Incentives (such as food supplements, food vouchers, cash, and clothing) may be provided to patients to cover personal costs for travel and missing work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Material incentives and enablers may have some positive short-time effects on clinic attendance, particularly for marginal populations, but there is insufficient evidence to know if they can improve long-term adherence to TB treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Some data suggest that illicit drug users adhere to DOT at equal or higher rates than other patients if appropriate incentives and enablers are offered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospitalization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outpatient treatment with DOT may not be sufficient for adherence in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In such circumstances, long-term hospitalization (voluntary or involuntary) may be necessary. In one series of 166 patients in Massachusetts, a dedicated medical-psychosocial inpatient unit facilitated completion of therapy in 97 percent of cases; hospitalization was required for the duration of therapy in 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Among 67 nonadherent patients in California detained in prison rather than a hospital ward, a lower completion rate was observed (84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Involuntary confinement is a strategy of last resort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-tuberculosis-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3705958742\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
