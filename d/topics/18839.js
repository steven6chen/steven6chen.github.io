Doctors call this having &quot;multiple comorbidities.&quot; This is especially common in people as they get older.</p><p>Here are some medical conditions that often occur together:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis or chronic pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression or anxiety</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H283971803\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the concerns about multiple health problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes, people with multiple health problems see different doctors about each of their problems. These doctors do not always realize how the problem they are working with fits into the &quot;whole&quot; of you. They might focus on your blood sugar level, but your first worry might be to stop the pain you have from arthritis when you walk. Sometimes, treatment (such as exercise) for one problem can make another problem worse. And some medicines can help one problem but make another worse. Your doctors need to know which other doctors you are seeing, so they can work together to form the best plan of care for you. You can help them do that.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H283971820\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I have multiple health problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have multiple health problems, do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work with your main doctor to decide what matters most to you when it comes to your care. Always remember that you can choose which treatments you want and don't want. Think about these questions and talk to your doctor about your answers:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Which of your health problems bothers you most? Which one do you want to focus on first?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What matters most to you: living a long time, staying independent, or having the least amount of pain or other symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Are any of your treatments causing side effects or problems?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plan for your doctor visits ahead of time. When you see your doctor, make a plan for what you want to discuss and come prepared with notes or questions. Do not try to do too much at once. If you need to, make more than one appointment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure that your main doctor, and any other doctor or nurse who prescribes medicines for you, knows about <strong>all</strong> of the medicines you take. This includes any over-the-counter or herbal medicines you use on a regular basis. It is also helpful to bring the actual bottles of pills you take to each visit, so your doctors or nurses can review them. Ask your main doctor or nurse to go over all your medicines with you at least once a year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep a list of all the medicines you take that includes the dose you take, your reason for taking it, and the doctor or nurse who prescribed it. Carry this list with you and bring it with you to all of your medical appointments. You can find an example of this kind of list at the following website: <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm079489.htm&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IOH1A9qYx6y2gNfguCapw4LVrAwUchd4jya7gdQvCezTm9dGzWRw5s0j5Z4wLQI7FQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=86146\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm079489.htm</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctors and nurses if there are things you can do on your own to deal with any of your health problems. Some medical problems get better with lifestyle or diet changes. If you can improve your condition with lifestyle changes, you might be able to avoid the risks and side effects of some of your medicines or treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H283971835\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are things that all people can do to improve their health. Here are some things you can do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and low in sweets and processed flours. For example, choose whole grain breads and whole grain pastas over white bread or regular pasta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do some sort of physical activity most days of the week, and build up your activity level slowly. Even small amounts of activity done several times a day can help you get stronger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to get enough sleep. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or nurse about possible solutions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you feel depressed or anxious, talk to your doctor or nurse. Depression and anxiety can make other health problems hard to manage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plan activities with other people, so you aren't stuck at home alone for days. If friends and family are not around, look at your local paper for ways to meet new people through senior centers, religious groups, libraries, garden clubs, or other activity groups.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H283971850\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-you-have-depression-and-another-health-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When you have depression and another health problem (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-medicines-when-youre-older-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking medicines when you're older (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
