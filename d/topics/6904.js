It can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burn calories, which helps people control their weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower blood pressure, especially in people with high blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower stress and help with depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep bones strong, so they don't get thin and break easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower the chance of dying from heart disease </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27849556\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the main types of exercise?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 3 main types of exercise. They are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aerobic exercise</strong> &ndash; Aerobic exercise raises a person's heart rate. Examples of aerobic exercise are walking, running, or swimming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resistance training</strong> &ndash; Resistance training helps make your muscles stronger. People can do this type of exercise using weights, exercise bands, or weight machines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stretching</strong> &ndash; Stretching exercises help your muscles and joints move more easily.</p><p/><p>It's important to have all 3 types of exercise in your exercise program. That way, your body, muscles, and joints can be as healthy as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27849563\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I talk to my doctor or nurse before I start exercising?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have not exercised before or have not exercised in a long time, talk with your doctor or nurse before you start a very active exercise program.</p><p>If you have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease (like high blood pressure or diabetes), your doctor or nurse might recommend that you have an exercise test before starting an exercise program.</p><p>When you start an exercise program, start slowly. For example, do the exercise at a slow pace or for a few minutes only. Over time, you can exercise faster and for longer periods of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27849570\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do when I exercise?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each time you exercise, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Warm up</strong> &ndash; Warming up can help keep you from hurting your muscles when you exercise. To warm up, do a light aerobic exercise (such as walking slowly) or stretch for 5 to 10 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Work out</strong> &ndash; During a workout, you can walk fast, swim, run, or use an exercise machine, for example. You should also stretch all of your joints, including your neck, shoulders, back, hips, and knees. At least 2 times a week, you can add resistance training exercises to your workout.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cool down</strong> &ndash; Cooling down helps keep you from feeling dizzy after you exercise and helps prevent muscle cramps. To cool down, you can stretch or do a light aerobic exercise for 5 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27849577\"><span class=\"h1\">How often should I exercise?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors recommend that people exercise at least 30 minutes a day, on 5 or more days of the week.</p><p>If you can't exercise for 30 minutes straight, try to exercise for 10 minutes at a time, 3 or 4 times a day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27849584\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have any of the following symptoms when you exercise, stop exercising and call your doctor or nurse right away:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or pressure in your chest, arms, throat, jaw, or back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like your heart is fluttering or racing very fast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or faint</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27849591\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I don't have time to exercise?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people have very busy lives and might not think that they have time to exercise. But it's important to try to find time to exercise, even if you are tired or work a lot. Exercise can increase your energy level, which might even help you get more work done.</p><p>On days when you really can't find time to exercise, there are ways that you can be more active. For example, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the stairs instead of the elevator</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Park in a parking space that is farther away from the door</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a longer route when you walk from one place to another</p><p/><p>Spending a lot of time sitting still &ndash; for example, watching television or working on the computer &ndash; can be bad for your health. Try to get up and move around whenever you can.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27849598\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do when I exercise?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To exercise safely and avoid problems, be sure to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink fluids during and after exercising (but drinks should not have caffeine in them)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid exercising outside if it is too hot or cold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear layers of clothes, so that you can take them off if you get too hot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes that fit well and support your feet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27849605\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment for type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metatarsalgia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Metatarsalgia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscle-strain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Muscle strain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=patellofemoral-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Patellofemoral pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=groin-strain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Groin strain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=activity-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Activity during pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hamstring-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hamstring injury (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
