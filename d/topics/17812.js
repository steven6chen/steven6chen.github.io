In children, the most common histologic form of idiopathic NS is with minimal changes, referred to as minimal change disease (MCD), occurring in approximately 75 percent of pediatric cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Prior to 1940, the mortality rate in children with NS was 40 percent, primarily due to infection, but it has been significantly reduced with the introduction of steroid treatment and antibiotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with MCD are generally responsive to steroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Because clinical findings are highly predictable in differentiating MCD from other forms of NS, steroid therapy can be initiated in patients who are likely to have MCD based upon clinical criteria without histological confirmation by renal biopsy. Up to one-third of patients with FSGS will also initially respond to steroid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical experience has demonstrated that the response to steroid therapy rather than the histologic features seen on renal biopsy is better at predicting long-term prognosis. Patients who respond to steroids have an excellent prognosis and rarely develop end-stage renal failure. As a result, patients with NS can be defined by their response to steroid therapy as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) &ndash; More than 90 percent of patients who respond to steroid therapy have MCD, and FSGS is primarily seen in the remaining patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Almost all patients with SSNS have an excellent outcome with few patients developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Patients who fail an initial course of steroid therapy should undergo renal biopsy to determine the underlying diagnosis to guide further therapeutic choices.

The following discussion is consistent with the Children's Nephrotic Syndrome Consensus and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) practice guidelines to treat pediatric NS, which are presented below. Symptomatic support and treatment of complications of NS are discussed separately.

In this guideline, steroid-sparing agents, such as oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) may be used to sustain remission and thereby reduce cumulative steroid doses and toxicity. However, in our experience, these patients usually do not require steroid sparing agents because low dose alternate-day prednisone is effective in preventing frequent relapses and is well tolerated.

In this meta-analysis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> therapy for three months or more reduced the risk of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) (relative risk [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-1.00) and of relapse by 12 to 24 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-1.00) compared with two months of therapy. Five or six months of prednisone therapy reduced the risk of relapse (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85) but not FRNS (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.50-1.22) compared with three months of therapy. <strong>However</strong>, a subgroup analysis of studies with <strong>low</strong> risk of bias showed no difference in the risk for FRNS between patients given prednisone for two or three months and those who received longer durations of therapy. The authors concluded that older, high risk of bias studies overestimated the effect of longer course therapy as compared with subsequent studies of higher quality, and that the evidence demonstrated no benefit of increasing the duration of prednisone therapy beyond two or three months for the treatment of the initial episode of NS.</p><p>As a result of these new data, treatment durations of two or three months are recommended for the management of the first episode of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) rather than longer durations, as recommended in the KDIGO guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].Slow tapering to avoid adrenal suppression may be important to maintain long-term remission as demonstrated in a small study that reported moderate to severe post-prednisone adrenal suppression was associated with an increased risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Increasing initial immunosuppression by adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> to steroid therapy had been proposed as a way to reduce the relapse rate.

Based upon the available data, we initially treat children with idiopathic NS who are likely to have MCD with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day (maximum of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. </p><p>With the initiation of steroid therapy, patients and their parents are taught to monitor urine protein levels by urine dipstick [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When proteinuria disappears, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> is continued at the same daily dose for an additional 30 days and then switched to alternate-day therapy (at the same dose).

As noted above, there is no consensus on the total duration of initial steroid therapy, but based on the available evidence, a prolonged initial treatment beyond two months does not reduce the incidence of relapse. However, it should be noted that these trials used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], whereas the earlier meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], which concluded that a prolonged course (greater than three months) was beneficial, was based mostly on data from trials using prednisone.

Several cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy caused by JC polyomavirus have been reported in patients with hematological disorders or lupus treated with rituximab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].

However, there is no clear evidence that any of the currently used immunosuppressive agents provide long-term efficacy without significant side effects.</p><p>As noted above, in our practice, we recommend the use of levamisole, if it is available. If this is not the case, MMF is our preferred drug for patients with significant steroid toxicity. Although data are limited, MMF appears to have similar efficacy to other nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agents, but with less toxicity. In patients who fail to maintain remission after treatment with levamisole and MMF, we switch to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a>.</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> is effective in inducing or maintaining remission in patients with frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent NS, sustained remission requires prolonged treatment and increases the risk of nephrotoxicity. As a result, in our practice, cyclosporine is used in patients who fail to maintain remission after a course of MMF or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> without a significant steroid dose. Based on the available data, we reserve <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a> only as a last resort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457115963\"><span class=\"h2\">Late steroid resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a small subset of cases, patients who were initially steroid-sensitive become steroid-resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/116-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-118</a>]. Although data are limited, case reports suggest that complete or partial remission can be achieved in the majority of patients using other immunosuppressive therapeutic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/116,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,117</a>]. However, these patients are at risk for renal function impairment and developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</p><p>This was illustrated in a multicenter retrospective review of 29 patients with late steroid resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. In this cohort, medications used to treat NS included MMF (n = 18), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> (n = 15), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a> (n = 13), an alkylating agent (n = 9), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a> (n = 4). Two-thirds of the patients received more than one of these agents. Patients also received steroid therapy for more than half of their total treatment time. At a mean follow-up time of 85 months, complete remission was achieved in 14 patients and partial remission in six patients. Six patients continued to have nephrotic range proteinuria and three developed ESRD. Over the study period, there were no deaths, but there were 13 episodes of serious adverse events including infections (encephalitis, bacteremia, and peritonitis), rhabdomyolysis, renal injury, and seizures. In this study with a limited number of patients, no risk factors were identified to predict response failure or ESRD.</p><p>Based on the available evidence, we suggest that nonsteroidal therapy be offered in patients who develop late steroid resistance.

Using multivariate analysis, the number of relapses as a child was the only factor predictive of relapses occurring later in life.
