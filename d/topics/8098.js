Introduced in the 1940s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the technique was refined during 1950 to 1970 and then introduced clinically for the treatment of poisoning in the 1970s and 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Despite its availability, this technique is only infrequently utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The type of adsorbent particle utilized within a hemoperfusion device may vary. The most commonly available particles are activated charcoal and resin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Charcoal hemoperfusion has been used to treat a variety of conditions, including poisoning and hepatic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain resins (polystyrene, XAD series) are most effective for the removal of lipid-soluble drugs, with drug clearance rates from the blood frequently exceeding those achieved by charcoal hemoperfusion. Although available in Europe, they are no longer available in the United States since the market was limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibers upon which immobilized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a> are attached have also been placed in hemoperfusion cartridges for direct contact with blood for the removal of endotoxin and cytokines.</p><p/><p>Antibody or antigen-coated charcoal hemoperfusion is also available for specific autoimmune states; they have been used infrequently for systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] and to remove pathogenic anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in some renal transplant candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, removal of endotoxin in septic shock has been achieved with a hemoperfusion device consisting of inert fibers coated with the antibiotic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a>, which adsorbs endotoxin, with some clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and ABO sensitization and desensitization in renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'HLA sensitization'</a>). Hemoperfusion devices have been approved in Europe and Japan for removing cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor, and others) in conditions such as septic shock and acute lung injury. They are not yet available in the US. Studies of these devices are ongoing, and their characteristics are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79263\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79263 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Early hemoperfusion devices produced significant side effects, such as facial flushing, dyspnea, burning sensations, thrombocytopenia, and reduced fibrinogen concentrations. These adverse effects have been largely overcome with modern preparatory methods, including selecting less fragile starting materials, washing, and, most importantly, coating of absorbents with a polymer solution that reduces platelet adhesion and complement activation.</p><p>An overview of hemoperfusion, including the clinical settings in which this technology may be considered, is reviewed here. A general introduction to the treatment of poisoning as well as a discussion of the use of other technologies in this setting, such as hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-elimination-of-poisons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced elimination of poisons&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of hemoperfusion in the treatment of specific intoxications, such as valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meprobamate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meprobamate</a>, are also discussed elsewhere. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoperfusion depends upon the physical adsorption of chemicals. With activated charcoal, drugs are irreversibly bound via van der Waals' forces; with resins, drugs are not irreversibly bound and can be eluted with organic solvents. In the case of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a>, endotoxin is bound by chemi-sorption.</p><p>Water- and lipid-soluble substances with molecular weights ranging from 100 to 40,000 daltons are well adsorbed with hemoperfusion. Charcoal has greater affinity for water-soluble molecules, while resins have greater affinity for lipid-soluble molecules. Chemicals at higher molecular weights are adsorbed less efficiently to polymer-coated charcoal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In many cases, drug removal (in terms of clearance) is superior with hemoperfusion than with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or forced diuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In general, hemoperfusion is preferred to hemodialysis for the removal of chemicals that are lipid soluble or are highly protein bound. Hemodialysis is preferred for water-soluble low-molecular-weight compounds since these compounds readily cross hemodialysis membranes. However, with the advent of high-flux dialysis membranes for routine hemodialysis, the advantage of hemoperfusion over cuprophane dialyzers has lessened since high-flux membrane drug removal may be equal to that of hemoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMOPERFUSION METHODOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoperfusion is conducted using dialysis blood lines, a blood pump, pressure gauges, and a column that contains between 100 and 300 g of activated charcoal or 300 to 650 g of resin. A list of some of the clinically available hemoperfusion devices and the contained sorbents is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79263\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79263 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The choice of cartridge depends upon body size and drug involved. As examples, a small cartridge is utilized for a child, while XAD-4 should be used for a lipid-soluble drug, such as glutethimide. Heparin requirements are similar to hemodialysis, and it is recommended to keep the activated clotting time (ACT) approximately 2 to 2.5 times normal or an activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) of approximately 60 to 70 seconds. Regional citrate anticoagulation is also used in many clinical centers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-anticoagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis anticoagulation&quot;</a>). Priming and flushing of the devices are achieved with normal saline.</p><p>To perform hemoperfusion, anticoagulated blood is withdrawn through a temporary vascular access (such as a double-lumen dialysis catheter) or permanent vascular access (arteriovenous or venovenous shunt) via a blood pump. Blood flow rates are graduated, depending upon the clinical condition of the patient. Efficient drug removal occurs with blood flow rates of approximately 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Pressure gauges detect interior rises in pressure, which indicate clot formation occurring inside the device; this is rare if heparinization is controlled via adequate monitoring of the ACT. If required, the procedure can be combined with hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the hemodialysis apparatus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemoperfusion is usually performed for approximately four hours. Reuse of devices is not performed, since partial saturation of small devices can occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITERIA FOR CONSIDERATION OF HEMOPERFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, hemoperfusion should only be employed in the setting of intoxication with a drug or poison that can be removed at a rate that exceeds endogenous elimination by the liver or kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among patients who are poisoned, hemoperfusion should be used in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive deterioration despite intensive supportive therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe intoxication with depression of midbrain function, thereby leading to hypoventilation, hypothermia, and hypotension</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of complications of coma, such as pneumonia or septicemia, as well as the presence of underlying conditions that predispose to such complications (eg, obstructive airway disease)</p><p/><p>Hemoperfusion should also be considered in the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment of normal drug excretory function due to hepatic, cardiac, or renal insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intoxication with agents with metabolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed effects, such as mushrooms and paraquat. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic failure, in which the extraction of hepatic toxins by hemoperfusion may prevent or delay hepatic coma and serve as a bridge to hepatic transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, some clinicians consider hemoperfusion to be unhelpful in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End-stage renal disease with aluminum intoxication; hemoperfusion has been used in conjunction with chelating agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a>) to remove aluminum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Hemofiltration using charcoal hemoperfusion doubles the rate of removal of the deferoxamine-aluminum chelate compared with standard hemodialysis membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, given the necessity for roughly one year of therapy, the most economical alternative is the use and reuse of a high-flux hemodialyzer rather than the very expensive charcoal hemoperfusion cartridge. In acute aluminum poisoning, high-flux dialysis (using deferoxamine as the chelating agent) was superior to that of charcoal hemoperfusion in removing aluminum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aluminum toxicity in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>If a poison is eliminated equally well with hemodialysis and hemoperfusion, hemodialysis is preferred since it will also correct a concurrent acid-base disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additionally, there is generally greater expertise and availability with respect to hemodialysis than hemoperfusion. If necessary, hemoperfusion can be combined with hemodialysis for the correction of an acid-base disturbance or of low body temperature in the severely hypothermic patient.</p><p>Experiments in humans suggest that regional hemoperfusion of blood draining a limb, the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], or the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] may significantly limit anticancer drug toxicity; regional use reduces systemic exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In animal intoxication models, hemoperfusion increases drug elimination rates of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amobarbital</a>, ethchlorvynol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, and digitoxin. In these animal models, as well as clinical experience, it has been observed that &quot;rebound&quot; of drug concentration occurs following hemoperfusion. An international working group (Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning [EXTRIP]) made up of experts in nephrology, clinical toxicology, critical care, and pharmacology does not support the use of hemoperfusion in severe intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoperfusion/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>With &quot;rebound,&quot; the drug redistributes from tissues into the plasma following its removal from the plasma compartment. This is consistent with the pharmacokinetic handling of drugs after their removal from the central compartment; the rebound in drug concentration in plasma may be clinically significant, including a return to severe neurologic dysfunction or coma (as with glutethimide poisoning).</p><p>Intermittent hemoperfusion helps minimize this &quot;rebound&quot; effect (as with paraquat and glutethimide). An additional advantage of intermittent hemoperfusion is a reduction in the hematologic side effects of prolonged hemoperfusion (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below). Replacement of saturated devices with fresh devices is not usually necessary but is another positive aspect of short intermittent hemoperfusion.</p><p>Not unexpectedly, a review of pharmacokinetic data reveals that hemodialysis and hemoperfusion enhance drug elimination only for specific drugs. In humans, in view of the difficulties in conducting controlled prospective clinical trials, a reduction in coma time or overall mortality has not been conclusively demonstrated, although it has been suggested by retrospective studies.</p><p>The table shows representative drug extraction ratios (amount of drug removed relative to one) for many drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62301\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62301 \">table 2</a>). The extraction ratios for many drugs are greater with hemoperfusion than with cuprophane hemodialysis, although high-flux membranes may offer an alternative and similar performance. The table lists some chemicals and drugs removed by various types of hemoperfusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52887\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52887 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important side effect of hemoperfusion with charcoal or resin preparations is platelet depletion. An average loss of 30 percent of platelets with coated or uncoated charcoal or resin occurs; the reduced platelet count usually returns to normal within 24 to 48 hours following a single hemoperfusion. Greater degrees of thrombocytopenia are observed with resin than with charcoal.</p><p>Other side effects of hemoperfusion are hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, and a transient fall in white blood cell count; these complications are usually minor and correct spontaneously or can be corrected. There is also a mild reduction of one to two degrees in body temperature.</p><p>Hypotension is infrequent. If needed, vasopressor agents should be administered distal to the sorbent devices to minimize their adsorption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7169304\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoperfusion consists of the passage of anticoagulated blood through a device containing adsorbent particles.
