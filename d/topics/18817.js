In a recent randomized trial, the use of PERC prior to conventional assessment (which included measuring a D-dimer level to determine further testing) did not alter the diagnostic rate of PE compared with conventional assessment alone. However, the PERC-based strategy did result in a 10 percent reduction in the use of computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. We continue to suggest using PERC when evaluating patients in whom there is a low suspicion for PE.

Among these, most do not have clinical findings of myocardial infarction. In a prospective study of about 2000 patients at increased cardiovascular risk (over 2500 surgeries), hs-cTnT was measured before and after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An increase in hs-cTnT occurred in 16 percent of surgeries and correlated with an increase in both 30-day and one-year mortality, irrespective of clinical findings of myocardial infarction.

In a trial that randomly assigned over 400 medical students and residents to review one of two hypothetical medical record notes that presented identical patients and differed only in the language used to describe them (eg, &quot;narcotic-dependent&quot; versus &quot;typically requires opioid medication&quot;; &quot;girlfriend is lying on the bed with shoes on&quot; versus &quot;girlfriend is by his side&quot;), those who were presented with the stigmatizing language provided less pain control and had more negative attitudes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Clinicians should be aware of the language that they use when caring for people with SCD.

A study of three million cases and over 1800 types of operations in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQUIP) database identified a continuum of cardiac risk within these categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, within the high-risk category identified by standard risk screening tools, there was a threefold difference in risk between laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy and Whipple procedure. These data have been used to create a more granular risk screening model that might better inform decisions about evaluation and alternative treatment. The model requires external validation and may require institution-specific modification for application. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery#H2810882344\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preanesthesia evaluation for noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Surgical risk'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116207\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety of MRI in patients with cardiac devices (January 2018)</span></p><p>Potential risks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with permanent pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) include programming changes, pacing abnormalities, and induced currents in lead wires. In a series of 1509 patients with older generation pacemakers or ICDs (eg, those that don&rsquo;t specifically meet MRI-conditional criteria specified by the Food and Drug Administration, or &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; devices) who underwent thoracic or non-thoracic MRI examinations and were followed for one year, there were no clinically significant events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While this and earlier reports are reassuring, the presence of a non-MRI-conditional pacemaker or ICD requires precautionary measures including device programming before and after MRI and patient monitoring during the imaging procedure, with availability of a defibrillator and code cart. If the examination is indicated and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness, MR imaging in patients with non-MRI-conditional permanent pacemakers or ICDs can be undertaken provided specific precautionary measures are in place.

In this context, questions arise about the risks of proceeding to surgery with uncorrected underlying abnormalities versus the risks of delaying surgery to perform a thorough preoperative assessment and optimize preoperative status. In a retrospective cohort study of over 40,000 patients, patients who had surgery for hip fracture within 24 hours of admission had lower 30-day mortality than patients who had surgery more than 24 hours after admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The results of this study support UpToDate's recommendation to perform surgery within 24 hours in patients who are medically stable. Patients with active medical comorbidities may require evaluation and stabilization of these issues before proceeding to surgery, but this should be done as quickly as possible.

A safety warning from the US Food and Drug Administration has been issued. There is insufficient information to guide the formulation of firm recommendations regarding this clinical scenario; our approach is presented. Clinicians should be aware of this issue and query patients about biotin or vitamin intake. When troponin results are unexpected, it is reasonable to further observe the patient and repeat the troponin test.

There was no difference in the rate of the composite outcome of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis while, as expected, the rate of transfusion was higher in the group with the higher transfusion threshold.

In a study of over 65,000 patients with a first episode of diverticulitis managed without colectomy, only 11.2 percent required readmission for recurrent diverticulitis in the next four years and only 0.9 and 0.75 percent required emergency and elective colon resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These rates do not justify colon surgery for most patients. Following an initial episode of acute diverticulitis, we recommend surgery for patients who have had complications from diverticulitis (eg, abscess, obstruction, fistulization) or who are immunocompromised, as subsequent attacks in such patients are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. We suggest not performing surgery routinely in other individuals.

An open-label randomized trial in patients with cancer and VTE reported that the composite outcome of VTE recurrence and major bleeding was similar with the DOAC <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a> when compared with the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dalteparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dalteparin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While edoxaban resulted in an increased rate of major bleeding, most events occurred in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. With the exception of patients with gastrointestinal cancer, these data support choosing either LMW heparin or edoxaban for first-line anticoagulant therapy in patients with cancer.

One placebo-controlled trial in such patients found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> did not reduce mortality at 28 or 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], while a similar trial in sicker patients reported hydrocortisone plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> reduced mortality at 90 and 180 days, but not at 28 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In both trials, hydrocortisone resulted in faster resolution of shock and was not harmful, but caused hyperglycemia. We suggest administering a glucocorticoid (eg, hydrocortisone) with or without fludrocortisone to patients with refractory septic shock, given a faster resolution of shock and a possible mortality benefit in sicker patients. While it is biologically unlikely that fludrocortisone enhances effectiveness of hydrocortisone, which has some mineralocorticoid effects, the only trial reporting a mortality benefit used combined therapy in sicker patients.

However, we suggest that glucocorticoids<strong> not</strong> be routinely administered for early ARDS, but they may be used on a case-by-case basis. We base this on the lack of a robustly proven mortality benefit, the potential for adverse effects, and the lack of clarification regarding glucocorticoid timing, duration, and dosing. Further randomized trials are awaited.

Thus, capnography may help identify which adults undergoing CPR are likely to develop a perfusing rhythm.

Compared with anticoagulation alone, the addition of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis to anticoagulation did not lower rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism or post-thrombotic syndrome but did lead to more bleeding events. We continue to recommend against the administration of thrombolytics for the treatment of uncomplicated DVT.

The systematic approach resulted in a doubling of the ICU admission rate and an increased risk of in-hospital death, but mortality was no different between the two approaches at six months. Several potential flaws, including a higher severity of illness in the intervention group, may have biased these results. We believe that the location of care should be individualized based upon patient characteristics, preferences for end-of-life care, available resources, and physician judgment.
