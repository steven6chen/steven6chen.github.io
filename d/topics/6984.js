It is caused by an abnormal gene. Parents pass the abnormal gene to their child. Often, people might not know they have the abnormal gene because they don't have any symptoms. The name &quot;Leiden&quot; comes from a city in Holland where the abnormal gene was discovered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182156\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of factor V Leiden?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with factor V Leiden never have any symptoms. But some people with factor V Leiden have a higher risk of getting blood clots, especially in the leg or the lungs. When clots do occur, they can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warmth, redness, pain, and swelling in the leg &ndash; These are symptoms of a condition called &quot;deep vein thrombosis&quot; or &quot;DVT.&quot; This is a blood clot in a vein deep inside the leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70603 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing problems, sharp chest pain, coughing, and fast heartbeat &ndash; These are symptoms of a condition called &quot;pulmonary embolism.&quot; This is a blood clot in the lungs. It usually comes from a blot clot in the leg that breaks off and travels to the lungs. This can be very dangerous and even cause death if the clot is large.</p><p/><p>Some doctors believe that factor V Leiden can also increase the chance of other problems, including stroke, heart attack, or miscarriage (when a pregnancy ends on its own before the baby can live outside the womb). But other doctors do not. If there is an increased risk of these conditions, it is a small increase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182197\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you think you might have a blood clot in your leg. If you have symptoms of a stroke or a blood clot in the lungs, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. These conditions are very serious and can be life-threatening.</p><p>If one of your relatives has been told that they have factor V Leiden, you can talk to your doctor or nurse to find out if you should be tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182212\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for factor V Leiden?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse thinks you might have factor V Leiden, he or she can order a blood test to look for the abnormal gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182227\"><span class=\"h1\">How is factor V Leiden treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If factor V Leiden causes a blood clot, the main treatment is medicines that get rid of clots or keep them from getting bigger. Some of these medicines come in shots and others come in pills. Doctors sometimes do surgery to remove a blood clot in the lungs if it is very severe.</p><p>People who have had a blood clot usually take a medicine in pill form to prevent clots for at least 3 months after the clot is found, and often for longer. This medicine helps keep new blood clots from forming. It is important because people who have one clot often have another later on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182242\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to prevent blood clots?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The best thing you can do is move your legs often. This keeps the blood moving. Not moving for a long period of time can increase your risk of clots. Examples are having surgery, being stuck in bed, or taking a long airplane or car trip.</p><p>To help prevent a clot on a long plane or car ride, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stand up and walk around every hour or 2 (or if driving, take breaks often)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear loose, comfortable clothes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change your sitting position and move your legs and feet often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink plenty of fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear knee-high compression stockings, especially if you get leg swelling</p><p/><p>Women with factor V Leiden should ask a doctor or nurse if it is safe to take birth control pills. The hormones in these pills raise the risk of blood clots. This can be dangerous for some women with factor V Leiden.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182259\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant or need surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant or need surgery, tell your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have had a blood clot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your father, mother, brother, or sister had a blood clot before age 50</p><p/><p>If the doctor or nurse thinks you might have factor V Leiden, he or she can order a blood test to look for it. If you have it, you might need to take medicine to help prevent blood clots.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823182274\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clots-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-embolism-blood-clot-in-the-lungs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-coumadin-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Warfarin (Coumadin) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
