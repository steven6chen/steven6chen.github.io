Pseudo-obstruction may be acute or chronic and is characterized by the presence of dilation of the bowel on imaging. Other causes of colonic distension including toxic megacolon, mechanical obstruction, and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction are discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical colorectal obstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391860878\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) is a disorder characterized by acute dilatation of the colon in the absence of an anatomic lesion that obstructs the flow of intestinal contents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H366746649\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction usually occurs in hospitalized or institutionalized patients in association with a severe illness or after surgery and in conjunction with a metabolic imbalance or administration of culprit medication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66068\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66068 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. In a large, retrospective series that included 400 patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, the most common predisposing conditions were nonoperative trauma, infection, and cardiac disease, each of which were associated with 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this series, cesarean section and hip surgery were the most common surgical procedures associated with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. In a systematic review of 125, postpartum cases of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction 62 (92 percent) occurred following caesarian section for varying indications including preeclampsia, multiple pregnancy, and antepartum <span class=\"nowrap\">hemorrhage/placenta</span> previa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. No specific risk factors could be identified for postpartum acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. In this review, 43 percent of patients had intestinal perforation or impending perforation, and 47 percent of patients required laparotomy, whereas conservative management was successful in 50 percent of cases. All patients with a cecal diameter of &gt;12 cm perforated as compared to 3 of 17 patients with a diameter of &lt;9 cm. Most perforations were diagnosed between day 3 and day 5 following the caesarian section. </p><p>Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is also well-documented after kidney transplantation, and possible contributing factors include obesity, cumulative dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> received, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545980898\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction usually involves the cecum and right hemicolon, although occasionally colonic dilation extends to the rectum. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction appears to be more common in men and in patients over the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, cases have been reported in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is a rare complication of surgery, occurring in 0.06 percent of patients after cardiac surgery, 0.29 percent of burn patients, and 0.7 to 1.3 percent of patients after orthopedic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. In surgical patients, symptoms usually present at an average of five days postoperatively. From a national hospital admissions database, the calculated incidence of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is approximately 100 cases out of 100,000 inpatient admissions per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise mechanism by which colonic dilation occurs in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is unknown. The association with trauma, spinal anesthesia, and pharmacologic agents suggests an impairment of the autonomic nervous system. Interruption of the parasympathetic fibers from S2 to S4 leaves an atonic distal colon and a functional proximal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. However, there is no proposed mechanism to explain colonic dilation in those patients without obvious involvement of the parasympathetic nerves.</p><p>In patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, increasing colonic diameter accelerates the rise in tension on the colonic wall, increasing the risk of colonic ischemia and perforation. The risk of colonic perforation increases when cecal&nbsp;diameter&nbsp;exceeds 10 to 12 cm and when the distention has been present for greater than six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The duration of dilation is probably more important than the absolute diameter of the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Rare cases have been reported in association with atrophic visceral myopathy with an extremely thin colonic wall, atrophic circular, and longitudinal muscularis propria without inflammation or fibrosis, and unaffected ganglion cells and myenteric plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The cause of the smooth muscle atrophy was unclear and the only potential association was with prior hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p>The main clinical feature in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is abdominal distension. Abdominal distension usually occurs gradually over three to seven days but may develop rapidly within 24 to 48 hours. Approximately 80 percent of patients have associated abdominal pain. Nausea and vomiting may be seen in up to 60 percent of patients. Constipation and, paradoxically, diarrhea have also been reported in approximately 50 and 40 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>]. In rare cases, abdominal distention can cause dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>]. </p><p>On physical examination, the abdomen is tympanitic, but bowel sounds are present in almost 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 65 percent of patients with a viable colon have mild abdominal tenderness on physical examination. However, the presence of fever, marked abdominal tenderness, and the presence of peritoneal signs (eg, guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness) are suggestive of colonic ischemia or perforation or their impending development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonic-ischemia#H278244257\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colonic ischemia&quot;, section on 'Acute colonic ischemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-tract-perforation#H73599335\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation&quot;, section on 'Presentations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391861109\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction should be suspected in patients with abdominal distension or pain and a physical examination that reveals a distended and tympanitic abdomen. The diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction is established by abdominal imaging. Colonoscopy should not be used to make the diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction, as insufflation of air may increase the colonic dilatation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545980823\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the evaluation is to establish the diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction, to assess for complications, and to rule out other causes of colonic distension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545980817\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform a complete blood count, electrolytes, and serum lactate levels. Given the rare cases associated with hypothyroidism and the fact it is eminently treatable, we also screen for hypothyroidism with a serum thyroid stimulating hormone. In patients with a suspected perforation and diffuse peritonitis, serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, amylase, and lipase levels should be obtained to rule out other causes of acute abdominal pain. In patients with diarrhea, we also perform stool cultures and stool evaluation for <em>C. difficile</em> toxin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H15443551\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Laboratory assays'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>There are no pathognomonic laboratory findings in patients with acute pseudo-obstruction. Laboratory evaluation may reveal leukocytosis and metabolic abnormalities. If present, leukocytosis is usually due to the patient's underlying disease or impending perforation and is not associated with an uncomplicated pseudo-obstruction. Metabolic abnormalities, especially hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia, are common, occurring in more than 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109746738\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan to establish the diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction and to rule out other causes of intestinal obstruction. In the absence of access to a CT scan, a contrast enema using a water-soluble contrast can be used to establish the diagnosis, provided that there is no evidence of peritonitis on physical examination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abdominal CT scan</strong> &ndash; On abdominal CT scan in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, there is proximal colonic dilatation, often with an intermediate transitional zone at or adjacent to the splenic flexure and a characteristically absent structural cause of colonic obstruction. Occasionally, dilation may extend to the rectum. In addition to differentiating acute colonic pseudo-obstruction from a mechanical obstruction, abdominal CT also has the advantage of demonstrating other intra-abdominal pathology that may have precipitated its development (eg, retroperitoneal hemorrhage).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contrast enema</strong> &ndash; Contrast enema with a water-soluble contrast demonstrates colonic dilation in the absence of a mechanical obstruction. In addition, it can potentially cause an osmotically driven evacuation of the colon and relieve the pseudo-obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, contrast enemas can increase intracolonic pressure and cause perforation. Contrast enemas should not be performed in patients with possible peritonitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abdominal radiographs</strong> &ndash; Plain and upright abdominal radiographs show a dilated colon, often from the cecum to the splenic flexure and occasionally to the rectum; haustral markings are normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78963\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78963 \">image 1</a>). As abdominal radiographic findings are not specific for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, the role of abdominal radiographs is limited to monitoring the colonic diameter once the diagnosis of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction has been established by abdominal CT or contrast enema. (See <a href=\"#H452332366\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction includes other causes of acute colonic dilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545980793\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mechanical obstruction frequently complain of crampy abdominal pain; however, lack of pain, especially in the older adult or postoperative patient receiving opiates, does not exclude that diagnosis. A &quot;cut-off sign&quot; (lack of gas in the distal colon or rectum) or small bowel air-fluid levels on abdominal radiographs can also be seen in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. However, a mechanical obstruction can be differentiated from acute colonic pseudo-obstruction by visualization of an obstructing lesion on abdominal CT or contrast enema. (See <a href=\"#H109746738\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545980799\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic megacolon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike patients with acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction, patients with toxic megacolon have evidence of significant systemic toxicity with fever, tachycardia, altered sensorium, and abdominal pain. Patients with toxic megacolon often have a history of severe bloody diarrhea or other signs or symptoms of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. On abdominal upright and plain films, there is evidence of colonic distension, but the normal colonic haustral pattern is either absent or severely disturbed with &quot;thumbprinting&quot; due to the presence of submucosal edema, or thickening of the colonic wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59217\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59217 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452331834\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of management is to decompress the colon in order to minimize the risk of colonic perforation and ischemia, which are associated with a high mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are few controlled trials comparing treatments of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. Our recommendations are largely consistent with a guideline for the management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and 2016 Clinical Practice Guideline from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67491\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67491 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452332366\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to management</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the risk of colonic ischemia and perforation, patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction should be carefully monitored with serial physical examinations and plain abdominal radiographs every 12 to 24 hours to evaluate the colonic diameter. In addition, we perform laboratory tests every 12 to 24 hours, including a complete blood count and electrolytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is usually conservative in patients without significant abdominal pain, extreme (&gt;12 cm) colonic distension, or signs of peritonitis and those who have one or more potential factors that are reversible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67491\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67491 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with cecal diameter &gt;12 cm and in patients who have failed 24 to 48 hours of conservative therapy, we use pharmacologic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a>. A meta-analysis of four studies that included 127 patients of which 65 were treated with neostigmine.

Because of the possibility of recurrence after the colonoscopic decompression, some authors recommend use of a multiperforated rectal tube and oral or colonic administration of polyethylene glycol laxative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is some evidence that performing colonoscopic decompression before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a> treatment may actually shorten hospital stay, though this advantage of decompression first may pertain mostly to younger patients without cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Percutaneous colostomy should be reserved for patients who fail endoscopic decompression and are not surgical candidates.

It is contraindicated in patients with colonic perforation or peritonitis.</p><p>An oral bowel preparation should not be administered prior to colonoscopy, due to the risk of aspiration in the presence of pseudo-obstruction. We do not administer enemas prior to the colonoscopy, as there is little stool passed following their administration because of the dilatation and lack of propulsion in the colon and the risk of colonic perforation. We place a decompression tube with the aid of a guidewire at the time of colonoscopy as this may reduce the need for repeated colonoscopic decompression. The guidewire is passed through the channel of the colonoscope after reaching the distal transverse colon. Air is suctioned from the colon and the wire left in place as the colonoscope is gently removed. The decompression tube (customized with several extra side holes, if necessary) is then passed over the guidewire and left in the transverse colon. To minimize air inflation, the whole colon should not be examined and the guidewire should not be delivered into the cecum. The decompression tube should be placed to gravity drainage and flushed every four to six hours.</p><p>The efficacy of colonic decompression has not been established in randomized trials. In case series, colonoscopic decompression alone is definitive therapy in less than 50 percent of patients, but, with concurrent placement of a decompression tube, success rates of 88 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/14,17,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17,35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Percutaneous decompression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While percutaneous cecostomy may be effective for treatment of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, it is invasive and can be complicated by local infection and bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. In addition, percutaneous decompression has not been directly compared with colonoscopic decompression or surgery.

Colonic ischemia and perforation are the two main complications of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction, which develop in approximately 3 to 15 percent of patients. The mortality rate in acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction in the absence of complications is approximately 15 percent with early appropriate management as compared with 36 to 44 percent in patients with a perforated or ischemic bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome/abstract/1,29,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) is a disorder characterized by acute dilatation of the colon in the absence of an anatomic lesion that obstructs the flow of intestinal contents. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction usually involves the cecum and right hemicolon, although occasionally colonic dilation extends to the rectum. (See <a href=\"#H391860878\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction usually occurs in hospitalized or institutionalized patients in association with a severe illness or after surgery and in conjunction with a metabolic imbalance or medication administration. (See <a href=\"#H366746649\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main clinical feature in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is abdominal distension. Abdominal distension usually occurs gradually over three to seven days, but may develop rapidly within 24 to 48 hours. Patients may also have nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, and, paradoxically, diarrhea. Plain and upright abdominal radiographs show a dilated colon, often from the cecum to the splenic flexure and occasionally to the rectum; haustral markings are normal. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction should be suspected in patients with abdominal distension or pain and a physical examination that reveals a distended and tympanitic abdomen. The diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction is established by abdominal imaging (eg, abdominal computed tomography [CT] scan or contrast enema) that helps to exclude a mechanical obstruction. Colonoscopy should not be used to make the diagnosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction, as insufflation of air may increase the colonic dilatation. (See <a href=\"#H391861109\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the risk of colonic ischemia and perforation, patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction should be carefully monitored with serial physical examinations and plain abdominal radiographs every 12 to 24 hours to evaluate the colonic diameter. In addition, we perform laboratory tests every 12 to 24 hours including a complete blood count and electrolytes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our recommendations for management are largely consistent with a guideline by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the 2016 Clinical Practice Guideline from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67491\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67491 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H452332366\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction consists of conservative therapy in patients without significant abdominal pain or signs of peritonitis and those who have one or more potential factors that are reversible. Conservative therapy can be continued for approximately 24 to 48 hours, in the absence of significant abdominal pain or extreme colonic dilatation (&gt;12 cm). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest pharmacologic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a> in patients at risk for perforation and those who failed conservative therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In patients with cecal diameter &gt;12 cm or failure of 24 to 48 hours of conservative therapy, we administer neostigmine (2 mg IV). We administer a repeat dose of neostigmine in patients with a partial response or recurrence after initial resolution. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Neostigmine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest colonoscopic decompression in patients who fail or who have contraindications to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest surgical decompression (with cecostomy if possible or colectomy) for patients who fail endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy and for those in whom exploration, lavage, or drainage of the peritoneal cavity is indicated for management of a colonic perforation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
