Evidence continues to accumulate concerning the adverse consequences of transfusing components containing leukocytes, leukocyte debris, or leukocyte-generated cytokines, and it is the author's opinion that, if cost were not a factor, pre-storage leukoreduction should be performed on all cellular components intended for transfusion. Some countries require universal leukoreduction of cellular blood components (RBCs and platelets), whereas this is not mandatory in the United States. It is estimated that approximately 85 percent of RBCs distributed to United States hospitals by their blood providers are pre-storage leukoreduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS FOR WHICH LEUKOREDUCTION IS SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 1 percent of all transfusions are associated with an otherwise unexplained rise in temperature of at least 1&deg;C, with or without chills and rigors. Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) are not serious, as the fever responds to antipyretics and the rigors to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>. However, these reactions are discomforting for the patient and ultimately quite expensive, since they require that an infectious etiology be excluded and, in many cases, that an additional unit of blood be crossmatched and transfused. In some patients (eg, asplenia due to sickle cell disease), development of fever may necessitate hospitalization and empiric antibiotic therapy until an infectious etiology is eliminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H1837255\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Leukoreduction'</a>.)</p><p>FNHTRs appear to be mediated both by donor leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and by cytokine generation and accumulation during the storage of blood components and after transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It has been proposed that an interaction between donor leukocytes and recipient antibody leads to interleukin (IL)-1 release from donor leukocytes or recipient monocytes. IL-1 produces fever by stimulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in the hypothalamus.</p><p>Regardless of the exact etiology, FNHTRs can be minimized by reducing the number of leukocytes transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Each unit of whole blood or unmodified red cells contains roughly 2 to 5 x 10<sup>9</sup> contaminating leukocytes. FNHTRs can be largely eliminated if the total leukocyte count is reduced by one to two logs (90 to 99 percent) to below 5 x 10<sup>8</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This degree of leukocyte reduction is achievable utilizing a variety of methods: saline washing, freezing and deglycerolizing, buffy coat removal, and microaggregate (&quot;second-generation&quot;) filters. The most effective current leukocyte reduction filters (&quot;third-generation&quot;) can achieve a three- to four-log (99.9 to 99.99 percent) reduction, leaving residual leukocyte counts below 5 x 10<sup>6</sup>, and generally below 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>However, randomized controlled studies of this issue are scarce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], and results of some retrospective observational studies have been conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Three large retrospective cohort studies compared the frequency of acute reactions to red cells and platelets during two different periods: when nonleukoreduced products were routinely given and when universal leukoreduction had been implemented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of FNHTRs to red cells was 0.33 to 0.37 percent prior to leukoreduction and was reduced to 0.15 to 0.19 percent following universal leukoreduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of FNHTRs to platelets was 0.45 to 2.18 percent prior to leukoreduction and was reduced to 0.11 to 0.15 percent following universal leukoreduction.</p><p/><p>A small fraction of FNHTRs are not eliminated by third-generation filtration (post-storage). Cytokine accumulation during storage may play a primary role in this setting since it has been demonstrated that the risk of a transfusion reaction increases with the age of the unit transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and that removal of plasma is more effective than post-storage leukoreduction in preventing reactions, especially severe reactions to platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>In one study, for example, patients were randomly assigned to receive transfusion of plasma-depleted versus post-storage leukoreduced platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Plasma depletion was associated with significant reductions in the frequency of reactions (17 versus 26 percent) and the percent of reactions judged as severe (18 versus 33 percent). Regression analysis identified plasma IL-6 levels as the most significant risk factor associated with these reactions.</p><p>For patients who experience repeated reactions even when transfused with post-storage filtered components, pre-storage filtration may alleviate the problem (see below). However, in some high-risk cases, even pre-storage filtration may not alleviate the problems of fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension. As an example, a randomized double-blind study compared the incidence of transfusion reactions in previously untransfused <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV+/CMV+</span> subjects who were randomly assigned to receive either pre-storage white blood cell (WBC)-reduced or unmodified red cell transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The incidence of 1&deg;C temperature increase (16 versus 18 percent), 2&deg;C temperature increase (3 versus 4 percent), and hypotension (5 percent for both) was not different between the two treatment groups. The only factor significantly associated with a reduction in the incidence of transfusion-associated fever in this highly specific group of patients was the lack of fever in the seven days prior to transfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">HLA alloimmunization and platelet refractoriness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain human leukocyte antigens (HLA) expressed on the surface of donor leukocytes can induce the production of HLA antibodies in multiply transfused patients. Clinical problems that result from such allosensitization include an increased risk of graft rejection in patients awaiting organ or bone marrow transplantation and platelet refractoriness in those requiring subsequent platelet transfusion support.</p><p>Patients who are alloimmunized and refractory to platelets are often difficult to manage, even with HLA-matched or crossmatched platelets, high-dose intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, or Rh immune globulin. As a result, it is prudent to try to prevent alloimmunization in patients expected to require prolonged transfusion support. Numerous studies, although varied in statistical and experimental design, provide strong evidence that leukoreduction to below 1 to 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells can decrease the development of primary platelet alloimmunization and refractoriness in patients with hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractoriness to platelet transfusion therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The best evidence in support of this approach has come from the Trial to Reduce Alloimmunization to Platelets (TRAP) conducted under the sponsorship of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This study randomly assigned 530 patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia who had no alloantibodies at baseline to receive one of four regimens, two of which were pooled platelet concentrates from random donors that were either unmodified (control) or filtered for leukoreduction. Compared with unmodified concentrates, the patients treated with leukoreduced concentrates had a lower incidence of both lymphocytotoxic antibodies (18 versus 45 percent, p&lt;0.001) and refractoriness to platelet transfusions (7 versus 16 percent, p = 0.03). A similar benefit was seen with exposure of the transfused platelets to ultraviolet B irradiation to inactivate antigen-presenting (white blood) cells in those concentrates.</p><p>In addition to direct viral transmission, it has been postulated that blood transfusion may cause reactivation and dissemination of latent CMV and HIV infections. This is supported by data from animal studies that have shown that allogeneic but not syngeneic transfusions activate latent CMV infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1427854059\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteria and other organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One rare but significant complication of transfusion is bacterial contamination of red cells. This is an important issue because such septic transfusion reactions carry a high fatality rate. Most bacterial contamination occurs either at the time of venipuncture or during component preparation. Less frequently, bacteria are introduced because the donor has a silent bacteremia at the time of donation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common organisms of clinical relevance are gram-negative, endotoxin-secreting bacteria that can survive cold storage. These include <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em> (<em>Y. enterocolitica</em>) and some Pseudomonas and Enterobacter species. Studies have shown that leukoreduction performed 2 to 12 hours after collection (&quot;pre-storage&quot; leukoreduction) can significantly reduce bacterial proliferation of <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The decreased proliferation may be mediated by removal of bacteria ingested by leukocytes, filtration of bacteria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prevention of release and subsequent proliferation of viable bacteria from disintegrating leukocytes. Regardless of the mechanism, it appears that an additional benefit of pre-storage leukoreduction is a decline in the risk of a septic complication of red cell transfusion.</p><p>In one study, leukodepletion resulted in a substantial reduction in free and intracellular organisms in blood artificially inoculated with Leishmania organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In a second study involving infected donors, red cell samples which had tested positive for Leishmania infantum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) became PCR-negative following leukodepletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335041255\"><span class=\"h2\">Reperfusion injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is well established that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium often leads to further ultrastructural damage, including necrosis. It is postulated that the tissue damage in this setting results from an inflammatory response in which leukocytes play a central role. Leukoreduction can prevent ultrastructural damage and reduce biochemical markers of myocardial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

These results and that of subsequent studies suggest that patients undergoing cardiac surgery may have lesser morbidity and mortality if transfused with red cells that have been leukoreduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

Since the cells latently infected with CMV are monocytes, leukoreduction will remove these cells and the infectious virus. If universal leukoreduction is performed, all patients will achieve this protection and no additional logistic challenges will be imposed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfuse CMV at-risk patients with leukoreduced components that are also CMV seronegative. Theoretically, this could provide additional benefits by applying both approaches simultaneously.</p><p/><p>Multiple observational studies have indicated the equivalency of the CMV seronegative and leukoreduction approaches in preventing transfusion-transmitted CMV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>It is unclear whether CMV serological testing adds additional benefit to leukoreduction. One small retrospective study in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation showed no additional benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. There is variation in practice with regard to using leukoreduced components alone or supplying leukoreduced components that are also CMV seronegative. Even with the combined approach, the consensus is that a small residual risk remains due to infectious virus in plasma during the CMV seronegative window period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. One approach to decreasing this small residual risk is to treat platelet units with pathogen reduction technology in jurisdictions where this has regulatory approval.</p><p>Allogeneic leukocytes can stimulate expression of HIV in infected cells in culture in a dose-dependent fashion; this phenomenon was not observed when the infected cells were cultured with leukoreduced blood components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. However, results of a Viral Activation Transfusion Study (VATS) trial in HIV-infected subjects showed no significant induction of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), HHV-8, HTLV-I, or HTLV-II viral replication following allogeneic transfusion of non-white blood cell (WBC)-reduced blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

It occurs in two clinical settings: when the recipient is immunodeficient or immunosuppressed (eg, from hematopoietic cell transplant, lymphoma) and when there is a specific type of partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between the donor and recipient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Immunodeficient states'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Partial HLA matching'</a>.)</p><p>Leukoreduction <strong>cannot</strong> be relied upon to prevent ta-GVHD.

By selectively trapping leukocytes from RBC (or platelet) concentrates passed through the filter, a large percentage of the original leukocytes are removed; the most effective leukocyte reduction filters (&quot;third generation&quot;) can achieve a three- to four-log (99.9 to 99.99 percent) reduction, leaving residual leukocyte counts below 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> (ie, below five <strong>million</strong>; the limit required by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) and generally below 1 x 10<sup>6</sup>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-storage versus post-storage leukoreduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukoreduction with third-generation filters can be performed shortly after component preparation (representing pre-storage leukoreduction) or at the time of release from the transfusion service or at the bedside (both of which represent post-storage leukoreduction). However, we do not use bedside leukoreduction, and we do not recommend its use. One major reason is that it is less standardized than pre-storage leukoreduction, and some staff may be less experienced with it since it is used less often. Another major reason is that bedside leukoreduction does not remove the cytokines secreted during storage, some of which may be responsible for causing transfusion reactions (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions'</a> above). The only significant advantage of post-storage leukoreduction is that only units requiring leukoreduction will be treated, thereby limiting the extra expense of filtration to those patients for whom it is medically indicated. We do not consider this small cost-saving to justify the use of bedside leukoreduction.</p><p>Additional benefits of pre-storage leukoreduction include immediate availability, more consistent quality, decreased cytokine and histamine production (and fewer transfusion reactions), and, potentially, a diminished risk of alloimmunization, immunosuppression, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> septic transfusion reactions. For these reasons, pre-storage leukoreduction has supplanted post-storage leukoreduction as the method of choice. Furthermore, preliminary studies suggest that the cost of filtration is often less than the cost of treating the complications of transfusing unfiltered components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypotension with bedside leukoreduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are over 80 reports of patients developing significant hypotensive events while receiving blood products (especially platelets) transfused through a bedside leukocyte reduction filter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. As a result, the FDA issued the following recommendations, dated May 4, 1999, for patients receiving blood products through a bedside leukocyte reduction filter:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watch for a precipitous drop in blood pressure, which may be associated with respiratory distress, facial flushing, abdominal pain and nausea, and loss of consciousness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately stop the transfusion if the above reaction occurs.

Whether this evidence is as yet sufficiently compelling remains, for a small minority, a subject for debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/9,11,45,82-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,45,82-87</a>].</p><p>It is clear that chronically transfused patients, potential transplant recipients, patients with acute leukemia, patients with previous transfusion reactions (febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions [FNHTRs]), cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative at-risk patients for whom seronegative components are not available, and patients undergoing cardiac surgery should receive leukoreduced blood components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion/abstract/84,88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,88,89</a>].
