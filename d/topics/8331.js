Labor usually starts on its own between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy. A woman's &quot;due date&quot; is at 40 weeks.</p><p>A pregnancy that lasts 37 to 42 weeks is called a &quot;term&quot; pregnancy. When labor starts before 37 weeks, doctors call it &quot;preterm&quot; labor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298413181\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the signs that labor is starting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The different signs that labor is starting can include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baby moves lower (or &quot;drops&quot;) in your belly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have increased vaginal discharge that is thick, mucus-like, or slightly bloody. (Vaginal discharge is the term doctors use to describe the fluid that comes out of the vagina.) The increased vaginal discharge is sometimes called a &quot;mucus plug&quot; or a &quot;bloody show.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your water breaks. During pregnancy, your baby is in a sac in your uterus and surrounded by a fluid called &quot;amniotic fluid.&quot; This sac will break open sometime before your baby is born. When it breaks open, the fluid inside comes out of your vagina. This can feel like a gush or trickle of fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have low back pain or belly cramps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You start having contractions. During a contraction, the uterus tightens. This can be painful and make your belly feel hard. After a contraction, the uterus relaxes and the pain goes away. Some women have &quot;Braxton Hicks contractions&quot; or &quot;false-labor contractions.&quot; These feel like contractions, but they are not true contractions. They do not mean that you are in labor.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298413188\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I tell if I'm having true contractions?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can be hard to tell if you are having true contractions or Braxton Hicks contractions. But here are some ways to help tell the difference.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True contractions come every few minutes and get more frequent over time. Braxton Hicks contractions can come every few minutes, but they don't get more frequent over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True contractions don't go away, even when you rest. Braxton Hicks contractions usually go away when you rest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True contractions will get stronger and more painful over time. Braxton Hicks contractions usually don't get stronger or more painful over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True contractions might be felt in your back and front. Braxton Hicks contractions are usually only in front.</p><p/><p>If you are still not sure whether you are having true contractions, call your doctor or midwife.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298413195\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I start having contractions?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you start having contractions, you should time them to see how far apart they are. That way, you can tell if they get more frequent.</p><p>You can time your contractions by writing down the time when each contraction starts. If you have a clock with a second hand, you can also time how long each contraction lasts. Your doctor or midwife will want to know how far apart your contractions are and how long they last.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298413202\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or midwife?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or midwife if you think you are in labor. You should also call if <strong>any</strong> of the following things happen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have blood, mucus, or fluid leaking from your vagina.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have 6 or more contractions in 1 hour. (That means your contractions are 10 minutes apart or less.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your contractions are getting stronger and are painful.</p><p/><p>Your doctor or midwife will probably want to see you to do an exam. To tell if you are in labor, he or she will check your cervix to see if it is opening (&quot;dilated&quot;) and thinning out. He or she will see how frequent your contractions are. He or she might also do other tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298413209\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my labor starts too soon?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you start having any symptoms of labor before 37 weeks, call your doctor right away. He or she might want to give you medicine to try to stop your labor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298413216\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my labor doesn't start on its own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your labor doesn't start on its own, your doctor will talk to you about your options. He or she might try to start your labor with medicines. This is called &quot;inducing labor.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298413223\"><span class=\"h1\">How long will my labor last?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If it's your first baby, your labor will probably last for many hours. If it's not your first baby, your labor will probably be shorter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298413286\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-during-labor-and-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain during labor and delivery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm labor (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-premature-rupture-of-membranes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm premature rupture of membranes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prenatal care (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
