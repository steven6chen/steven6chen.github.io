Patients often lack motivation and perseverance to alter their nutritional pattern, a source of frustration to those who care for them. Also, a patient's decision to alter his or her lifestyle is often related to social circumstances, as in this patient, who is motivated to make changes in response to his daughter's encouragement. Unfortunately, he changed his diet without medical supervision, with adverse consequences. Nevertheless, the patient remains motivated and seeks your advice. This is the time to renew your efforts to achieve an improved lifestyle.</p><p>Return to the beginning to try again.
