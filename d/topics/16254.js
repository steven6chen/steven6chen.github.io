It usually gets better on its own. But sore throat can sometimes be serious.</p><p>See a doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever of at least 101&deg;F or 38.4&deg;C</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your throat pain is severe within the first 2 days, or does not start to improve within 5 to 7 days</p><p/><p><strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> or go to the emergency room if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are drooling because you cannot swallow your saliva</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have swelling of the neck or tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot move your neck or have trouble opening your mouth</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392020380\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes sore throat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sore throat is usually caused by an infection. Two types of germs can cause it: viruses and bacteria. People who have a sore throat caused by a virus do not usually need to see a doctor or nurse. People who have a sore throat caused by bacteria might need to see a doctor or nurse. They might have a type of infection called strep throat. Only about 1 in 10 adults who seek medical care for sore throat have strep throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392020387\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I tell if my sore throat is caused by a virus or strep throat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is hard to tell the difference. But there are some clues to look for.</p><p>People who have a sore throat caused by a virus usually have other symptoms, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A runny nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stuffed-up chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itchy or red eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A raspy (hoarse) voice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the roof of the mouth</p><p/><p>People who have a sore throat caused by strep throat <strong>do not</strong> usually have a cough, runny nose, or itchy or red eyes. But they might have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe throat pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (temperature higher than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen glands in the neck</p><p/><p>If you think you have strep throat, the doctor or nurse can check you for it easily. He or she can run a swab (Q-Tip) along the back of your throat and test it for the bacteria that cause strep throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392020394\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need antibiotics?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have an infection caused by a virus, you <strong>do not</strong> need antibiotics. But if you have strep throat, you should get antibiotics. Most people with strep throat get better without antibiotics, but doctors and nurses often prescribe them anyway. That's because antibiotics can prevent problems sometimes caused by strep throat. Plus, antibiotics can reduce the symptoms of strep throat and prevent its spread to other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392020401\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want some relief from the pain of sore throat, you can take pain medicine that you can get without a prescription. Throat sprays are no better at soothing pain than sucking on cough drops or candy. Some people feel relief if they gargle with salt water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392020408\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I go back to work or school?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have strep throat, wait 1 day after starting antibiotics. By then you will be a lot less likely to spread the infection. If you do not have strep throat, you can go back as soon as you feel well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392020415\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to prevent getting a sore throat again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wash your hands often with soap and water. It is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infection. You can use an alcohol rub instead, but make sure the hand rub gets everywhere on your hands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392020422\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sore throat in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sore throat in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
