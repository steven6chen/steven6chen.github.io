He experiences early satiety and has been eating multiple small meals and snacks as a result. He feels that food is &quot;clogged up&quot; in his abdomen for two to three days at a time. He vomits every few days. When he does so, the vomitus often contains food that he had eaten more than 24 hours earlier. Yesterday, the vomitus contained bits of chicken and salad from his supper the day before. He has a bowel movement every two to three days. His symptoms did not respond to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> at full recommended doses for several weeks in each case.
