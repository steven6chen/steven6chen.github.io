Reasons for reintervention included device malfunction and treatment failure. Although some trials of SNM for OAB have found symptom improvement rates of 90 percent and cure rates up to 50 percent, the rate of reintervention should be considered in selecting treatment options when noninvasive therapies do not achieve sufficient symptom reduction.

However, in a trial of 609 overweight adults who were randomly assigned to a healthy low-fat diet or a healthy low-carbohydrate diet, both groups experienced comparable weight loss, and there were no interactions between weight loss and low-fat sensitive or low-carbohydrate sensitive genotypes or baseline insulin secretion levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This finding is consistent with our approach emphasizing adherence and healthy food choices over specific macronutrient composition.

In a recent randomized trial, the use of PERC prior to conventional assessment (which included measuring a D-dimer level to determine further testing) did not alter the diagnostic rate of PE compared with conventional assessment alone. However, the PERC-based strategy did result in a 10 percent reduction in the use of computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. We continue to suggest using PERC when evaluating patients in whom there is a low suspicion for PE.

In a retrospective cohort study of patients treated over a four-year period at a specialty referral facility offering hyperbaric oxygen treatment, 61 patients treated for carbon monoxide poisoning had a history of exposure to waterpipe smoking. The most common symptoms were syncope, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Clinicians should be alert to this risk and warn patients of this potential consequence of waterpipe use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-tobacco-use#H1713552768\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of tobacco use&quot;, section on 'Waterpipes or hookahs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116389\"><span class=\"h2\">Tobacco use rates vary among occupations (January 2018)</span></p><p>The association between occupation and tobacco use rates among United States working adults shows considerable variation, both in overall rates of use and in usage of specific categories of tobacco products. Cigarette smoking rates ranged from approximately 25 percent (construction workers and workers in accommodation and food service industries) to just over 5 percent (workers in education and workers in life, physical, and social sciences) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Use of two or more tobacco products was highest (10 percent) among workers in installation, maintenance, and repair.

However, a prospective cohort study found higher all-cause mortality and cancer incidence among people aged 59 to 82 who consistently smoked 10 or fewer cigarettes a day than among never-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Even smoking less than one cigarette daily was associated with higher mortality and cancer rates. Quitting smoking lowered the risks; the younger the age at quitting, the lower the risks. Sharing such data with patients may help to encourage quitting smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation#H99356499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Questionable utility of smoking reduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116207\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety of MRI in patients with cardiac devices (January 2018)</span></p><p>Potential risks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with permanent pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) include programming changes, pacing abnormalities, and induced currents in lead wires. In a series of 1509 patients with older generation pacemakers or ICDs (eg, those that don&rsquo;t specifically meet MRI-conditional criteria specified by the Food and Drug Administration, or &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; devices) who underwent thoracic or non-thoracic MRI examinations and were followed for one year, there were no clinically significant events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While this and earlier reports are reassuring, the presence of a non-MRI-conditional pacemaker or ICD requires precautionary measures including device programming before and after MRI and patient monitoring during the imaging procedure, with availability of a defibrillator and code cart. If the examination is indicated and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness, MR imaging in patients with non-MRI-conditional permanent pacemakers or ICDs can be undertaken provided specific precautionary measures are in place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Permanent pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116197\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential for burns from electronic nicotine delivery systems (January 2018)</span></p><p>Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) serve as heat generators for e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn (HNB) cigarettes. Added to the risk related to chemical constituents produced during use of an ENDS, there is a risk of burns due to device malfunction. Burns to local tissue have occurred while an ENDS device was stored (eg, in a pants pocket) or during its use, resulting in burns to the thigh, groin, face, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While reported previously, this risk may not be widely recognized among clinicians or users of ENDS.

A large epidemiologic study (Nurses&rsquo; Health Study) recently found that women with a history of GDM who did not progress to type 2 diabetes also had a small absolute increase in risk of CVD, which was attenuated by but persisted after adjusting for lifestyle risk factors for CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These data further support our recommendation to discuss healthy lifestyle behaviors (heart-healthy diet, maintenance of a healthy weight, tobacco avoidance, and physical activity) with all women who have had GDM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational diabetes mellitus: Glycemic control and maternal prognosis&quot;, section on 'Long-term risk'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115949\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of surgery for hip fracture (December 2017)</span></p><p>Hip fractures most commonly occur in frail older adults who have significant underlying comorbidity. In this context, questions arise about the risks of proceeding to surgery with uncorrected underlying abnormalities versus the risks of delaying surgery to perform a thorough preoperative assessment and optimize preoperative status. In a retrospective cohort study of over 40,000 patients, patients who had surgery for hip fracture within 24 hours of admission had lower 30-day mortality than patients who had surgery more than 24 hours after admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The results of this study support UpToDate's recommendation to perform surgery within 24 hours in patients who are medically stable. Patients with active medical comorbidities may require evaluation and stabilization of these issues before proceeding to surgery, but this should be done as quickly as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical consultation for patients with hip fracture&quot;, section on 'Timing of surgical intervention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116060\"><span class=\"h2\">Biotin may interfere with the results of troponin testing (December 2017)</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Biotin</a>, which is contained in varying amounts in many vitamins and dietary supplements, may impact the results of high-sensitivity troponin assays. In general, the reported troponin values are decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. A safety warning from the US Food and Drug Administration has been issued. There is insufficient information to guide the formulation of firm recommendations regarding this clinical scenario; our approach is presented. Clinicians should be aware of this issue and query patients about biotin or vitamin intake. When troponin results are unexpected, it is reasonable to further observe the patient and repeat the troponin test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116019\"><span class=\"h2\">Coffee consumption and health (December 2017)</span></p><p>For most nonpregnant adults, moderate coffee consumption appears to be safe. In a review of meta-analyses of largely observational studies of multiple health outcomes, coffee consumption was more often associated with benefit than with harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Drinking three to four cups of coffee per day was associated with the greatest benefit. Harmful associations were largely absent after adjustment for smoking except in pregnancy, where high consumption was associated with an increase in risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, and pregnancy loss. Given the limitations of observational studies, UpToDate neither promotes nor discourages coffee consumption in nonpregnant adults but discourages more than 200 to 300 mg of caffeine intake per day in women who are pregnant or attempting to conceive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-effects-of-caffeine-on-reproductive-outcomes-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The effects of caffeine on reproductive outcomes in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115624\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence of high blood pressure in United States adults under the 2017 revised definition of hypertension (November 2017)</span></p><p>The 2017 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines changed the definition of hypertension in adults (now defined as a systolic pressure &ge;130 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a diastolic pressure &ge;80 mmHg). This has substantially changed the prevalence of hypertension among adults in the United States. According to NHANES data from 2011 to 2014, 46 percent of adults 18 years and older had hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Based upon the size of the adult population, this translates into 103 million adults in the United States with hypertension.

Major changes from prior recommendations include a lower threshold for the diagnosis of hypertension based upon office blood pressure readings (hypertension now defined as a blood pressure &ge;130 mmHg systolic or &ge;80 mmHg diastolic), and a lower blood pressure goal <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;130/&lt;80</span> mmHg). Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for all hypertensive patients with a higher cardiovascular risk, and for lower-risk patients who have a blood pressure &ge;140 mmHg systolic or &ge;90 mmHg diastolic. Recommendations in UpToDate are broadly consistent with these guidelines.

A large systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies among individuals aged 14 to 30 years showed that, compared with e-cigarette never-users, ever-users had a higher probability of initiating cigarette smoking (31 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These studies do not distinguish if e-cigarette use increases the desire to smoke conventional cigarettes or whether e-cigarette users have a predisposition to smoke. Nonetheless, the finding of a greater likelihood of future conventional smoking among younger e-cigarette users is useful information for clinicians when educating patients about risks of tobacco use.

We suggest RZV rather than ZVL for most patients who meet criteria for vaccination. RZV appears to provide greater protection against herpes zoster, and there is less concern for waning immunity. The choice of RZV as the preferred type of vaccine is consistent with recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Disadvantages of RZV are the need for two doses (versus one with ZVL), and an increased risk of mild to moderate side effects (pain at the injection site, myalgia, fatigue, headache, fever) that typically resolve in one to three days. These factors rarely prevent patients from completing the RZV series. For patients who previously received ZVL, we suggest revaccination with RZV. The optimal use of RZV in immunocompromised patients is still to be determined.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents#H773444165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Infants'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116334\"><span class=\"h2\">Rotavirus vaccination in hospitalized infants (January 2018)</span></p><p>Administration of live oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rotavirus vaccine</a> to hospitalized infants is often delayed until discharge due to concerns about virus transmission, but delay may preclude administration due to the strict age limit for dosing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70478\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70478 \">table 13</a>). A prospective study evaluated rotavirus vaccination, shedding, and transmission in a cohort of 385 infants admitted to an intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Among the 127 infants age-eligible for pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5), 26 percent received &ge;1 dose and 42 percent of unvaccinated infants were no longer eligible for vaccination at discharge. Although rotavirus was detected in 1 percent of surveillance stool specimens from vaccinated and unvaccinated infants, no clinical cases of vaccine-type rotavirus occurred. These data suggest that delaying RV5 until discharge may not be necessary and may lead to missed opportunities for vaccination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-vaccines-for-infants#H500915621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotavirus vaccines for infants&quot;, section on 'Premature infants'</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-family-medicine/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Chughtai B, Thomas D, Sun T, Sedrakyan A.
