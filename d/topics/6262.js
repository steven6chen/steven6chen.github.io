Prior to 1996, the annual mortality among individuals with HIV infection exceeded 20 percent; this rate declined to &lt;2 percent a decade later with the availability of effective treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, following the introduction of ART, new concerns arose about drug toxicities, including body fat maldistribution and metabolic abnormalities (eg, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus), and their potential association with cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>This topic addresses the epidemiology of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and cardiovascular risk factors in the setting of HIV infection and treatment. The incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of dyslipidemia in HIV-infected patients, HIV lipodystrophy, and HIV-associated cardiac complications, such as pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiomyopathy, are also discussed separately.

In particular, cardiovascular disease has emerged as an important cause of death in HIV-infected patients relative to the decreasing incidence of opportunistic disease. Several lines of evidence, from modeling of calculated cardiovascular risk to clinical studies evaluating such hard endpoints as stroke, myocardial infarctions (MIs), and sudden cardiac death have cumulatively supported this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. The data evaluating the rate of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients compared with uninfected populations and its association with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV disease state are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14700934\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence compared with uninfected populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have analyzed large clinical databases and cohorts in the United States, Canada, and Europe to compare the incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with and without HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-27</a>]. Although some of these studies are limited by low number of events, short follow-up, and incomplete assessments of other cardiac risk factors, they consistently report a 1.5-fold increase in the rate of cardiovascular events in HIV-infected individuals compared with control populations. One of the largest of these studies evaluated California state-sponsored health insurance claims data, which included 28,513 HIV-infected and 3,054,696 uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (including acute MI, other ischemic heart disease, and coronary atherosclerosis) in patients between the ages of 18 and 24 years was low overall but increased in those infected with HIV compared with the uninfected (relative risk [RR] 6.76, 95% CI 3.36&ndash;13.58 for men and 2.47, 95% CI 1.23&ndash;4.95, for women). The relative risk of CHD was the most increased in HIV-infected patients over the age of 45 years compared with uninfected populations.</p><p>Other analyses have found that the risk of MI alone is elevated in HIV-infected patients across a wide range of ages. In a cohort of 27,350 HIV-infected and 55,109 age-matched HIV-uninfected predominantly male veterans followed for a median of six years, HIV infection was associated with a greater risk of acute MI overall, even after adjusting for Framingham risk factors and other comorbidities (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.27-1.72) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. When the cohort was analyzed by 10-year age groups, HIV infection was associated with a greater MI risk among patients aged 40 to 69 years but not among younger or older patients. Similarly, in a cohort from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, the age-adjusted rate of hospitalization for MI was 4.3 versus 2.9 events per 1000 person-years in HIV-infected and uninfected men, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, a subsequent update from the Kaiser study demonstrated a decline in rates of MI among the HIV group leading to a rate similar to that in the HIV-uninfected group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A slightly higher overall MI rate was observed from two tertiary care hospitals in Massachusetts, with 11 versus 7 acute MI events per 1000 person-years in HIV-infected and uninfected patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Even when adjusted for age, gender, race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cholesterol, HIV infection remained associated with a significantly higher incidence of MI (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.51&ndash;2.02). Among women, the relative risk for MI compared with controls was further increased. Similar findings were reported from cohorts in France and Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14700942\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of antiretroviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degrees to which HIV infection itself, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and ART each contribute to the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease in the HIV-infected population remain an active area of investigation. However, the preponderance of data suggests individual ART agents might differ in their contributions to the risk of cardiac events. Most studies that show an association between ART and cardiovascular events implicate older protease inhibitor (PI) use; however, this does not appear to be a class effect. (See <a href=\"#H742255\" class=\"local\">'Protease inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p>The Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) Study Group prospectively studied the incidence of MI in 23,468 HIV-infected patients residing in Australia, Europe, and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The overall incidence was low at 3.5 events per 1000 person-years, but the incidence increased with cumulative exposure to ART (age-adjusted RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12&ndash;1.41, for each additional year of exposure). The association between ART and MI persisted in models that controlled for total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, suggesting that ART may negatively affect cardiovascular risk independent of its effects on lipid profile. (See <a href=\"#H2957201\" class=\"local\">'Effect of antiretroviral therapy on lipid levels'</a> below.)</p><p>Some, but not all, other subgroup analyses of retrospective database and cohort studies similarly demonstrate that the relative risk of cardiovascular disease compared with HIV-uninfected patients was greater in HIV-infected patients on ART than those not on ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/19,22,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22,31</a>]. One notable exception is the United States Veterans Study that retrospectively evaluated 36,766 HIV-infected veterans for risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Between 1995 and 2001, the overall mortality decreased by more than 75 percent. The rates of hospital admissions related to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease remained constant over time and were comparable between ART-treated and untreated patients. These findings persisted in a follow-up study that extended the evaluation period from 1993 to 2003 and included 41,213 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Compared with no therapy, there was no significant difference in the rate of serious cardiovascular events after 24, 28, and 72 months of exposure to ART. The reasons for the discrepancy between this and other studies of cardiovascular risk with ART are unknown, although the veteran population may represent a group with higher cardiovascular risk at baseline.</p><p>Nevertheless, several studies suggest that higher CD4 cell counts and lower HIV RNA levels are associated with decreased MI risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>], and in one trial, interruption of ART led to increased cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], suggesting that treating HIV with ART clearly has beneficial effects on MI risk. (See <a href=\"#H743048\" class=\"local\">'Effect of antiretroviral therapy interruption'</a> below and <a href=\"#H24755939\" class=\"local\">'Effects of CD4 cell count and viral load'</a> below.)</p><p>The full extent of cardiovascular risk in treated HIV-infected patients will become more discernible as many of the initial cohorts continue to follow patients over time. Since the HIV-infected population is relatively young and actual cardiovascular events are infrequent, many investigators have used surrogate measures of coronary artery disease, such as intima media thickening of the carotid and coronary arteries, as indirect endpoints. The effect of ART on these markers of cardiovascular disease is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients#H10000548\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Subclinical atherosclerosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H742255\"><span class=\"h3\">Protease inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some, but not all, studies show an association between PIs and cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17,23,29,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23,29,40,41</a>]. In the studies that show a positive association, the PIs evaluated included agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indinavir</a>, which are no longer considered preferred first-line agents in the United States (although lopinavir-ritonavir is still used in resource-limited settings). Furthermore, specific evaluation of individual PIs suggests that the increased risk of cardiovascular disease is not a class effect. More commonly used PIs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a>, each combined with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a>) may not have the increased risk of cardiovascular disease seen with other agents from this class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H742816\"><span class=\"h3\">Abacavir</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have evaluated whether the risk of cardiovascular disease may be related to particular agents within the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class, specifically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a>. The mechanism of action for the association remains uncertain and the time course of exposure to outcome does not appear to be immediate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Overall, the data surrounding abacavir and MI risk are conflicting without clear conclusion.</p><p>In sequential analyses of the D:A:D cohort evaluating 580 events over 178,835 person-years, there was an increased risk of MI in those exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> within the six months prior to the MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43</a>]. This increased risk was not seen with other NRTIs, including tenofovir. Criticisms of these studies suggested that abacavir may have been preferentially prescribed to those patients with metabolic syndrome and renal disease, reflecting prescriber bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, in a follow-up study of the D:A:D cohort that included 941 MI events over 367,559 person-years, the rate of MI was 0.47 among those receiving abacavir at the time and 0.21 among those not receiving abacavir (adjusted risk ratio 1.98, 95% CI 1.72-2.29) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There was no difference in the risk associated with abacavir before and after 2008, despite evidence that individuals at moderate or high cardiovascular risk were less likely to initiate abacavir after this time.</p><p>In a secondary analysis of the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) study, a randomized controlled trial to compare continuous versus interrupted ART administration, patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> or didanosine without abacavir were compared with patients on all other NRTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Preliminary results demonstrated a fourfold risk of MI and a significant increase in other coronary artery disease events, such as stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure, in association with abacavir use compared with other NRTIs. No such association was found with didanosine. Other studies, including a randomized controlled trial and several observational cohorts also found increased cardiovascular risk with abacavir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22,42,47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,42,47-50</a>].</p><p>However, not all studies consistently show risk of MI with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>]. A pooled analysis evaluated the results of 52 industry-sponsored studies in the drug manufacturer's database of HIV trials, which included 9502 patients who received abacavir and 4672 who took other antiretroviral medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Baseline demographics and clinical factors, including lipid and glucose values, were similar between both groups. Rates of MI were comparable among patients exposed or not to an abacavir-containing regimen. Other analyses of data from randomized controlled HIV drug trials arrived at similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/51,53,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53,55</a>].</p><p>Studies evaluating changes in inflammatory or coagulopathic biomarkers upon initiation or discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> similarly have demonstrated conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/46,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients#H25650733\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of vascular disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H743048\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of antiretroviral therapy interruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies suggest that longer duration of ART use, and particularly of some PIs, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, in the SMART study, a large international study of CD4 cell count-guided ART interruption, the 2720 patients randomly assigned to the drug interruption arm had an increased risk of major cardiovascular events compared with the 2752 patients in the continuous treatment arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. After approximately 3700 person-years of follow-up (median 16 months), there were 79 fatal and nonfatal MIs; the event rate in the interruption group was 1.3 per 100 person-years compared with 0.8 per 100 person-years in the continuous therapy group.</p><p>Thus, despite some concerns that certain ART agents may be associated with cardiovascular risks, the discontinuation may result in an even greater risk of disease. One possible explanation for this finding is that suppression of HIV itself may be cardioprotective, possibly by reducing proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-6) that may play a role in arterial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/29,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,57</a>]. Additionally, discontinuation of ART may impact the lipid profile, leading to a reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, a finding that was associated with MI in a case control analysis of SMART study participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

In a nested case-control study within the French Hospital Database on HIV, 289 HIV-infected cases who had a prospectively recorded first-time MI were age-, gender-, and site-matched to 884 HIV-infected controls with no history of MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cases had a lower mean CD4 cell count nadir than controls (135 versus 177 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> but current CD4 counts were similar between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower nadir CD4 cell count and higher plasma viral load were associated with a small but statistically significant increased rate of MI, independent of exposure to ART and presence of traditional risk factors.</p><p/><p>Furthermore, in a retrospective analysis of 3068 HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands, 57 patients experienced a cardiovascular event (MI, stroke, need for coronary artery intervention) during the nearly 11,000 patient years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Those patients with poor immunological recovery (ie, CD4 cell counts remained &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> two years following initiation of ART) had higher estimated five-year cardiovascular event rates (4.7 percent) than those with better CD4 cell count improvements (2 to 2.6 percent). This associated cardiovascular risk was attenuated after adjusting for variables such as age, gender, and prior history of an event. Similarly, in a large cohort study of over 27,000 HIV-infected individuals, each 300-cell increase in current CD4 count was associated with a 25 percent decrease in MI risk, and higher HIV-1 RNA levels also predicted MI risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>By contrast, in the large D:A:D cohort study, there was no association between nadir CD4 cell count (lowest recorded value) or peak HIV viral load and incidence of MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957187\"><span class=\"h1\">TRADITIONAL RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, the classic cardiovascular risk factors of dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking are common among HIV-infected populations, although the frequency of these comorbidities is not sufficient to explain the overall increased incidence of cardiovascular disease observed in the setting of HIV infection.</p><p>The presence of major risk factors for cardiovascular disease were evaluated among 1455 women and 931 men participating in two United States-based cohorts of HIV-infected patients (the Women's Interagency HIV Study [WIHS] and the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study [MACS]) and compared with HIV-uninfected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) was estimated using the Framingham risk score equations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators&quot;</a>).

In vitro models, animal models, studies of HIV-negative volunteers given PIs, and clinical trials of PIs have all demonstrated insulin resistance with these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. One possible explanation for the association is the observation that PIs can direct down-regulation of the glucose transporter isoform GLUT4, the major transporter of glucose into fat cells and cardiac and skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Several studies have also noted an association between cumulative exposure to NRTIs and greater insulin resistance and diabetes risk compared with no NRTI exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/114-116\" class=\"abstract_t\">114-116</a>].</p><p>Most of these studies evaluated patients using older antiretroviral agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indinavir</a>, which are no longer commonly used in resource-rich settings.

In a study that analyzed billing codes from two large hospitals in Massachusetts, the diagnosis of hypertension was recorded more frequently among patients with HIV infection (21 versus 16 percent in those without HIV infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This higher prevalence of hypertension may be related to ART, as illustrated by findings of MACS, which followed 5578 HIV-infected men over 19 years and observed a significantly higher systolic blood pressure in those using ART for greater than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. This increase was not noted if ART was used for less than two years. However, an association between specific ART agents and the risk of incident hypertension has not been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. An association between hypertension and higher waist-hip ratio among HIV-infected patients has also been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957349\"><span class=\"h2\">Cigarette smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking rates among HIV-infected individuals are considerably higher than those seen in the general population. As an example, in a survey of over 4000 HIV-infected adults in the United States, 42 percent were current smokers and 20 percent were former smokers, in contrast to 21 and 22 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Other studies from various countries have reported rates of current or former smoking among patients with HIV infection ranging from 57 to 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20,29,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29,121</a>].</p><p>As in the general population, smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected individuals and is associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-123</a>]. One Danish cohort study suggested that the increase in cardiovascular risk associated with smoking was greater for HIV-infected individuals than uninfected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. In another cohort study of 2921 HIV-infected patients with free access to ART who did not use injection drugs, current compared with never smoking was associated with increased mortality from both cardiovascular and all causes (RRs 4.3, 95% CI 1.4-13.1, and 4.4, 95% CI 3.0-6.7, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. This translated into a loss of 12.3 years of life among smokers with HIV compared with nonsmokers with HIV, more than double the 5.1 years of life lost attributable to HIV alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367874\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK MODIFIERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367855\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipodystrophy syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lipodystrophy syndrome refers to abnormal fat redistribution with lipoatrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lipohypertrophy that can occur in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), which is sometimes associated with metabolic syndrome. The exact prevalence of this phenomenon is unclear, and there may be different risks for fat loss versus accumulation, suggesting discrete processes. Nevertheless, although HIV-infected patients with abnormal fat redistribution may not have overt obesity, it is often associated with significant metabolic abnormalities, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, and thus increased cardiovascular risk. As an example, 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk estimates were compared in 91 HIV-infected and uninfected patients from the Framingham Offspring Study who were matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. The risk estimates were significantly higher in HIV-infected patients with evidence of fat redistribution. However, when these patients were matched to controls based on waist-to-hip ratio measurements, the CHD risk was similar. Furthermore, HIV-infected patients without evidence of fat redistribution did not have an increased CHD risk compared with controls. These data suggest that increased cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected patients may be associated with fat redistribution itself.</p><p>The epidemiology of lipodystrophy and its association with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance are discussed elsewhere.

Several studies in men have suggested a greater risk of cardiovascular disease in the setting of HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/128-130\" class=\"abstract_t\">128-130</a>]. In the largest of these, the incidences of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular events were greater among 6136 <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV-co-infected</span> veterans (4.2 and 12.5 events per 1000 person-years, respectively) compared with those observed among 13,288 veterans with only HIV infection (3.4 and 11.1 events per 1000 person-years, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. However, when adjusted for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, age, and duration of ART, the increased risk of MI among the co-infected was not statistically significant. Additionally, in an analysis of data prospectively collected from 32,395 HIV-infected individuals in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study, the risk for development of MI was similar for <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV-co-infected</span> patients compared with HIV-monoinfected patients after adjusting for potential confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].</p><p>Controlling for potential confounders is important as HCV infection does appear to be associated with various factors that affect cardiovascular risk. There are a few studies that suggest that increased cholesterol levels may be blunted in patients co-infected with HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/129,131-134\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,131-134</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 357 HIV-infected patients and 115 <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV-co-infected</span> patients taking ART, the mean changes in cholesterol were significantly lower in co-infected patients than in patients with HIV alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H743048\" class=\"local\">'Effect of antiretroviral therapy interruption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected patients tend to have lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and greater triglyceride levels, independent of any exposure to ART. Certain antiretroviral agents, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a>, can exacerbate these lipid profile changes. Protease inhibitor (PI) regimens that require a lower dose of ritonavir for boosting (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a>) tend to have less unfavorable effects on the lipid profile.
