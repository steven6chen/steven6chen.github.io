The overall estimated incidence of SCID in the United States is 1:58,000, based upon data from universal newborn screening (NBS) in 10 states plus the Navajo Nation over a four-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The X-linked form of SCID accounted for only 19 percent of the identified cases, with the remainder comprised of autosomal recessive forms of SCID. Data from retrospective studies of relatively limited numbers of patients prior to the advent of NBS for SCID suggested there was an incidence of 1:500,000 for autosomal recessive SCID among outbred populations and 1:10,000 for first cousin marriages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Based upon the subsequently obtained unbiased, population-based NBS data, however, it appears that the true incidence for autosomal recessive SCID is closer to 1:72,500, with significantly higher rates in certain founder populations. As an example, the estimated incidence of Athabascan SCID (SCIDA) in the Navajo and Apache Native American populations is approximately 1:2000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Finally, autoantibodies and elevated B cell-activating factor (BAFF) levels have been found in patients with Omenn syndrome and &quot;leaky&quot; SCID, suggesting that the generation of an autoreactive B cell repertoire associated with defective central and peripheral checkpoints of B cell tolerance is also important in the pathogenesis of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphopenia with a median absolute lymphocyte count of <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL</span> (range 40 to 1400) is present in all Athabascan SCID (SCIDA) patients, including those with maternal engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

These patients should also be evaluated for maternal engraftment. Children with Omenn syndrome (in particular, those with recombinase activating gene 1 or 2 [<em>RAG1</em> or <em>RAG2</em>] defects) characteristically do not have detectable maternal T cell engraftment, while those with Artemis defects can have maternal engraftment.

Any patient with T-B-NK+ SCID who does not have a mutation in <em>RAG1, RAG2</em>, or <em>DCLRE1C</em> should be evaluated for other possible defects in the V(D)J pathway, including <em>LIG4</em>, and <em>NHEJ1</em>, as well as adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency and other SCID genes, since treatment options and transplantation protocols may require adjustment depending upon genotype. If mutations cannot be found, the next step is to obtain a fibroblast cell line from the patient for radiation sensitivity testing. Not all SCID patients will have clearly deleterious homozygous or compound heterozygous defects in a known SCID gene. Additional pursuit of the underlying gene defect may require whole-exome or even whole-genome sequencing.

The significantly increased morbidity and mortality in patients with the T-B-NK+ phenotype who are not RAG1 or RAG2 deficient may be due to the inability to efficiently repair alkylator chemotherapy-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs).</p><p>A rapid test for radiation sensitivity would be ideal in the evaluation of newly diagnosed children with SCID prior to conditioning for HCT, particularly in patients with &quot;leaky&quot; or nonnull mutations who may appear to have T+B+NK+ SCID or a milder immunodeficiency and therefore might not be suspected to have radiation sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Unfortunately, the only screening study available requires a fibroblast cell line from the patient. Once the fibroblast cell line is generated, the test is relatively straightforward and can detect patients with possible Artemis, DNA ligase IV, or other DNA-repair protein defects. However, it generally takes six to eight weeks to obtain an adequate fibroblast culture. For many children with SCID, this delay in diagnosis and transplantation can reduce their chances of survival.

Patients were generally transplanted at an early age (mean 2.3 months) and had a relatively short interval between diagnosis and HCT (mean of 1.5 months). As an example, 7 of the 16 infants were diagnosed either in utero or at birth (because of a positive family history) with early transplantation prior to the onset of serious infections. The use of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens in 14 of 16 initial transplants also likely contributed to the absence of mortality in the immediate posttransplantation period and subsequent long-term survival.</p><p>However, only 52 percent of the 82 recipients of haplocompatible-related donor transplants in the first study were long-term survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Survival in the haploidentical transplant group was 67 percent in patients who received myeloablative conditioning. In an earlier retrospective review of the European experience with 178 T cell-depleted HLA-nonidentical donor transplants, the disease-free survival for patients with T-B- SCID was only 35 percent at a median period of 52 months compared with 60 percent at 57 months in the T-B+ SCID group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The relatively poor survival of those with T-B- SCID was associated with an increased graft failure rate and a delay in immune reconstitution post-HCT. At one year posttransplant, for example, less than 20 percent of the T-B- recipients had normal B cell immunity compared with 50 percent of the T-B+ patients. Conditioning with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> provided the best cure rate in both groups (74 and 43 percent for T-B+ and T-B- recipients, respectively).</p><p>Conditioning with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> or some other alkylating agent that opens marrow niches appears to be required for adequate B cell reconstitution in children with Athabascan SCID (SCIDA). In a previously discussed study, two of the three SCIDA patients to achieve B cell reconstitution received myeloablative conditioning regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Unfortunately, only one of these children is a long-term survivor who suffers from short stature and absence of permanent tooth development. The use of an immunosuppressive conditioning regimen or no conditioning resulted in T cell, but not B cell, reconstitution in 11 of 12 initial transplants for SCIDA.</p><p>However, SCIDA patients who are exposed to alkylating agents are at risk for late complications that are not seen in other forms of SCID, such as pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, absence of secondary teeth and other dental abnormalities, endocrinopathies, and short stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,41,42</a>].</p><p>Results were reported in 87 patients from 38 centers in Europe and North America who received HCT for primary immunodeficiency (PID) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malignancy associated with defective genes involving DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair including <em>LIG4, NBM, NHEJ1</em>, and <em>ATM</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Of the 77 patients with DNA ligase IV deficiency, Cernunnos-XLF deficiency, or Nijmegen breakage syndrome, survival was only 41 percent for those who received myeloablative conditioning (high-dose alkylator therapy) compared with 79 percent for those receiving reduced-intensity conditioning (including low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>). The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was high in this group of 87 patients, with 37 percent having grade 3 to 4 disease, and 18 percent with chronic GVHD.

However, these regimens also significantly increase transplant morbidity and mortality, especially in young infants and those with radiation sensitivity. Whether or not to provide pre-HCT conditioning of any form in patients with T-B-NK+ SCID to a large degree depends upon donor availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,33,38,40,41,44-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,33,38,40,41,44-49</a>]. In general, conditioning therapy is not needed to achieve at least T cell reconstitution when HLA-matched donors are available. Some form of immunosuppression with an alkylating agent is generally necessary for transplantation with haplocompatible T cell-depleted stem cells (unless maternal cells are present).</p><p>The best approach for preconditioning for HCT in children with the radiation and alkylating agent-sensitive types of T-B-NK+ SCID is not yet defined, although ongoing studies in North America by the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC), a consortium of 43 centers focused on HCT, gene therapy, and enzyme replacement therapy for children with SCID, should help to shed light on this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In a preliminary analysis of over 500 children in North America with typical or leaky SCID who received HCT between 1968 and 2010, the PIDTC found that, in general, patients with SCID had the best T cell immune reconstitution and were more likely to come off of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy when they received either reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning rather than no conditioning or only immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, those with ART-SCID did significantly worse when compared with other genotypes such as interleukin 2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2RG; XSCID), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), interleukin 7 receptor alpha chain (IL7RA), and RAG.</p><p>Successful engraftment of haplocompatible T cell-depleted parental grafts is significantly reduced in children with T-B-NK+ SCID (unless maternal chimerism is present) compared with those with T-B+NK- SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,41</a>]. This is presumed to be due to the presence of normal functioning NK cells, which are known to mediate graft resistance. Thus, conditioning may be necessary for those in whom there is no maternal engraftment and an HLA-matched donor is not available. Patients with maternal engraftment are already tolerant of maternal cells. Thus, the mother can be used as the donor without conditioning in these patients, as long as the graft is T cell depleted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Patients with defects in RAG1 or RAG2 are more likely to tolerate aggressive conditioning regimens than non-RAG1 or RAG2 types of T-B-NK+ SCID, because those with RAG1 or RAG2 defects are restricted in expression to T and B cells, leaving other somatic cells able to repair DNA damaged from myeloablative regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The majority of transplants for Omenn syndrome due to <em>RAG</em> mutations or other defects have used intensive myeloablative and immunosuppressive conditioning, regardless of the donor-recipient match or donor source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. This is because Omenn syndrome patients have relatively large numbers of T cells, of which some are activated and capable of cytotoxic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Myeloablative regimens with reduced toxicity, such as those using targeted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, may significantly improve outcomes for these patients.</p><p>Patients with ART-SCID appear to be more susceptible to adverse effects, particularly late toxicities, from conditioning regimens that include alkylating therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ionizing radiation. In one series, there was no difference in survival or the incidence of acute GVHD in patients with ART-SCID, regardless of exposure to alkylators, although a higher incidence of infection was seen. However, in patients surviving more than two years post-HCT, there was a significant association among short stature, abnormal dental development including absent secondary teeth, and late endocrine effects in patients with ART-SCID who received alkylator therapy prior to their transplant. In addition, these patients are at least theoretically at higher risk for malignancy secondary to radiotherapy due to their inability to effectively repair DNA, although no increased incidence of malignancy has been seen in children with ART-SCID to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362041956\"><span class=\"h4\">General approach in T-B-NK+ SCID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No conditioning is necessary for transplantation with HLA-matched related donors (and possibly with a perfectly matched unrelated donor) in order to achieve durable T cell reconstitution and, in limited cases, B cell reconstitution. An HLA-matched related donor may be used without conditioning therapy even with maternal engraftment. The mother should be used as the donor if maternal engraftment is present and an HLA-matched relative is unavailable. Under these circumstances, T cell depletion of the graft (either by CD34 cell selection or T cell receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">[TCR]-alpha/beta</span> depletion) should be performed to minimize the risk of fatal GVHD.</p><p>Immunosuppressive conditioning is generally necessary for those children without maternal engraftment or an HLA-matched relative, although in one study approximately one-third of children with NK+ SCID without maternal engraftment and with no conditioning engrafted with haplocompatible donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Thus, it is reasonable to attempt a haplocompatible transplant without conditioning under certain circumstances, such as while searching for an unrelated donor, and to consider immunosuppression only if the graft is rejected, especially if the child has no active infections.</p><p>For many years, the standard immunosuppressive conditioning regimen for SCID patients was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> with or without antithymocyte globulin. This regimen was reasonably well tolerated with few apparent long-term sequelae except sterility, unless there was also an associated DNA-repair defect or the child was very young [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. With the success of newborn screening (NBS) for SCID and its implementation in almost all states, the number of newly diagnosed patients with severe, life-threatening infections has already diminished significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Increasingly, instead of being three to six months old at the time of diagnosis and transplant, most SCID children will be newborns and potentially even more susceptible to the short- and long-term toxicities of alkylating agents whether or not they have an increased sensitivity to these agents.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fludarabine</a> (a nonalkylator) was evaluated for HCT for SCID at several centers as a replacement for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> because of its more specific T cell immunosuppressive activity and less toxic side effects. However, fludarabine has little to no effect on NK cells, and preliminary results with haplocompatible grafts are discouraging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. In contrast, conditioning with fludarabine and immunotherapy for immunosuppression appeared effective for matched related and unrelated grafts including cord blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. There is some evidence in patients with DNA DSB repair defects other than ART-SCID that using regular doses of fludarabine with reduced doses of cyclophosphamide is effective in overcoming the NK cell-mediated graft resistance seen with fludarabine alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Thus, cyclophosphamide (in low doses if radiation-sensitive SCID [RS-SCID]) should be used if NK resistance is anticipated. A potential alternative approach is the use of monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>) or antithymocyte globulin that bind to NK cells and induce apoptosis as well as suppress NK function, therefore reducing graft resistance mediated by NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. However, to date, neither alemtuzumab nor antithymocyte globulin appears effective in suppressing NK cell graft resistance in this patient population. (See <a href=\"#H2362041962\" class=\"local\">'Approach in radiation-sensitive SCID'</a> below.)</p><p>Most transplant centers use either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> regimens for myeloablation when an HLA-matched related donor is not available for a child with SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/52,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,59,60</a>].

The failure to reconstitute B cell immunity in T-B-NK+ SCID suggests a more complex maturation process for the B cell lineage and absence of the selective advantage that appears to exist for donor T cells. The higher mortality seen with myeloablation is largely due to the fact that children with SCID who are ill at the time of diagnosis with opportunistic infections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failure to thrive are more susceptible to toxic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. At one center, preliminary experience in this patient population that included newborns suggests that targeting lower exposures of busulfan using new pharmacokinetic models in infants under 10 kg may achieve sufficient levels of donor stem cell chimerism to restore both T and B cell immunity while reducing toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362041962\"><span class=\"h4\">Approach in radiation-sensitive SCID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alkylating agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> are more toxic in patients with RS-SCID, even without pre-existing infection and at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The use of either no conditioning or immunosuppressive conditioning alone (eg, low-dose cyclophosphamide) for the initial HCT in children with non-RAG1 or RAG2 types of T-B-NK+ SCID is suggested in order to minimize the exposure to alkylating agents. Donor marrow &quot;boosts&quot; or repeat HCT with myeloablative conditioning are reserved for those cases in which the initial procedure results in inadequate T cell immune reconstitution or graft failure, respectively. A combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and serotherapy with antithymocyte globulin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> (a monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52 on mature lymphocytes, leading to their destruction) can be used if immunosuppression is felt to be necessary. However, this regimen has not been formally evaluated to any degree in this patient population and therefore should be used with caution.

(See <a href=\"#H2362041859\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2362041865\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unless detected by newborn screening (NBS) in the presymptomatic phase, children with T-B-NK+ SCID present early in life with serious infections and failure to thrive. Several unique features are seen in children with Omenn syndrome and Athabascan-speaking Navajo and Apache Indian children with Athabascan SCID (SCIDA). Children with Omenn syndrome generally have early onset (less than three months) of diffuse, exudative erythroderma; lymphadenopathy; hepatosplenomegaly; and chronic, persistent diarrhea. They also have elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and hypereosinophilia. A unique clinical feature seen in over half of patients with SCIDA is the presence of Noma-like ulcers, deep and painful ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa or genitalia. (See <a href=\"#H2362041871\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic laboratory manifestations include lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, absent B cells with absent isohemagglutinin titers and no response to immunizations, absent T cells with low to absent proliferative responses to mitogens and alloantigens, and normal number and function of NK cells. Some patients with defects in DNA ligase IV (<em>LIG4</em>) or nonhomologous end-joining factor 1 <em>(NHEJ1)</em> may also present with thrombocytopenia, anemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neutropenia and have fewer T and B cell immune abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H2362041901\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of T-B-NK+ can be made in a child who presents with NBS diagnosis or later with signs and symptoms typical of SCID (ie, failure to thrive, chronic mucocutaneous fungal infections, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> opportunistic infections) and the characteristic lymphocyte phenotype and laboratory findings. Increasingly, children are identified by NBS when they are found to have an abnormally low number of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). Additional studies include examining the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire for skewed oligoclonal bands, determining the number and percent of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, and evaluating for maternal engraftment. The specific etiology is determined by gene sequencing, with radiation sensitivity testing as a backup when pathogenic disease-causing mutations are not identified. A gene diagnosis is not essential for moving forward with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), although modified preparative regimens for radiation-sensitive SCID (RS-SCID) are advisable. Thus, radiation sensitivity testing should begin as soon as possible when the T-B-NK+ phenotype is identified and while genotyping is underway. (See <a href=\"#H2362041907\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCT is presently the treatment of choice and the only known cure for children with T-B-NK+ SCID. The outcome is best in those who have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor. Survival after HLA-nonidentical transplantation is worse among those with the T-B-NK+ phenotype than the T-B+NK+ or T-B+NK- forms of SCID. Myeloablative preparative regimens facilitate engraftment and immune reconstitution. However, these regimens also significantly increase transplant morbidity and mortality, especially in young infants and those with radiation sensitivity. Improved outcomes with HLA-matched unrelated adult donors and mismatched cord blood units have been reported, and it is possible that conditioning is not necessary with a perfectly matched unrelated donor.
