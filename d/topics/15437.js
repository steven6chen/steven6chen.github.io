Frequent testing is particularly important for MSM aged 13 to 24 years, where the rate of new infections increased by 43 percent from 2003 to 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection-drug users.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons who exchange sex for money or drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex partners of persons who are HIV-infected, bisexual, or inject drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons who have sex with partners whose HIV status is unknown.</p><p/><p>The importance of repeat testing among those at ongoing risk is supported by findings from the CDC National HIV Surveillance System [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Between 2006 and 2009, there were an estimated 125,104 new diagnoses of HIV infection. For those with a detailed testing history, 41 percent were diagnosed on their first test, while 59 percent were diagnosed with HIV infection within one to two years after a negative test result. </p><p>The use of routine HIV testing in resource-limited settings is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H114330379\" class=\"local\">'Resource-limited settings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384998360\"><span class=\"h3\">Rationale for routine screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substantial number of individuals remain unaware that they are infected with HIV. In the United States, an estimated 1.2 million persons were living with HIV in 2011, and 14 percent had undiagnosed infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the percentage of persons with undiagnosed HIV infection varies by geographic area. As an example, at the end of 2012, the percentage of individuals with undiagnosed HIV infection was greater in Louisiana (approximately 23 percent) compared with &lt;10 percent in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, and New York [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that only 54 percent of people with HIV infection knew their HIV status worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Identifying patients infected with HIV is important because it allows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The institution of early ART, which reduces clinical events and mortality in patients with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. In the United States, patients who are diagnosed early in the course of infection and are successfully treated with ART may have life expectancies similar to those in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, in 2008, 33 percent of patients were diagnosed late in the course of infection and developed AIDS within one year of their initial HIV diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies#H525605897\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection: Risk factors and prevention strategies&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In the United States, the CDC issued guidelines in 2006 advocating routine voluntary HIV screening of all patients aged 13 to 64 years as a normal part of medical care, without the need for signed consent or counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Prior to that, risk-based screening had been the standard of care. The use of routine screening was introduced, in part, to identify patients who may not disclose their risk factors or see themselves at risk. In addition, risk assessment can be time consuming, and providers may not be able to reliably integrate risk assessment into routine care. As an example, in a study of 440 HIV-infected patients, of whom the majority had a CD4 count &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> at the time of diagnosis, only 26 percent had HIV risk factors documented in the medical record more than one year before their diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The American College of Physicians (ACP) Guidance Statement on HIV screening, released in 2009, similarly endorsed universal screening, although it suggested that the age range be expanded to 75 years because of the growing number of HIV infections in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended universal HIV screening among patients aged 15 to 65 years. They also recommended HIV screening for younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk for infection (eg, MSM, active injection drug users, those who have acquired or requested testing for sexually transmitted infections, and individuals with behavioral risk factors), and pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Multiple studies have indicated that routine HIV testing is cost effective in the United States, especially if the seroprevalence is &ge;0.1 percent (national average of 0.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/23-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-29</a>]. In addition, the use of universal rather than targeted testing in ambulatory care settings appears to increase the number of new HIV diagnoses and reduce the proportion diagnosed late in the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cluster randomized trial in the United Kingdom compared an educational intervention promoting opt-out rapid HIV testing versus standard of care in community-based clinics where the HIV prevalence was high (8 patients per 1000 adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Over approximately two years, there were more patients diagnosed with HIV in the practices that received the intervention (32 versus 14). In addition, there was a nonsignificant increase in the mean CD4 count at the time of diagnosis (356 versus 270 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span>. However, three clinics in the intervention arm withdrew (one because of workload reasons).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single-center cluster randomized trial compared universal and targeted HIV screening in an urban emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The estimated seroprevalence was 0.36 percent. When universal screening was performed, 1915 of 4692 patients (41 percent) consented and six new HIV infections were diagnosed. When targeted screening was performed, 1813 of 4880 (37 percent) had no testing indication; of the 3067 remaining patients, 47 percent consented and three patients were diagnosed with HIV.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2842890537\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING ALGORITHM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2898308609\"><span class=\"h2\">Preferred approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our preferred testing algorithm uses a fourth-generation <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/antibody</span> combination <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV-1/2</span> immunoassay plus a confirmatory <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV-1/HIV-2</span> antibody differentiation immunoassay (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91270\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91270 \">algorithm 1</a>). A discussion of the different types of tests is found below. (See <a href=\"#H3828426\" class=\"local\">'Tests'</a> below.)</p><p>For HIV screening of asymptomatic individuals or patients with signs and symptoms of chronic infection, a fourth-generation combination <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV-1/2</span> immunoassay is initially performed. This assay detects both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies as well as HIV P24 antigen. Whenever possible, we use the combination tests designed only for laboratory use, rather than the rapid lateral flow assay, because of increased sensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H679394082\" class=\"local\">'Combination HIV antigen and antibody tests'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the fourth-generation combination assay is negative, the person is considered HIV-uninfected, and no further testing needs to be done.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the fourth-generation combination assay is positive, an <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV-1/HIV-2</span> antibody differentiation immunoassay is performed. This test confirms the results of the combination assay and also provides information as to whether the patient is infected with HIV-1, HIV-2, or both viruses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A plasma HIV RNA level should be obtained to evaluate for acute infection if the fourth-generation test is positive and the confirmatory <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV-1/HIV-2</span> antibody differentiation immunoassay is indeterminate or negative. (See <a href=\"#H1139383765\" class=\"local\">'Indeterminate test results'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>If there is concern for acute HIV infection (eg, the patient presents with mononucleosis-like symptoms and had a recent high-risk exposure), additional testing with HIV RNA (either qualitative or quantitative) should be performed. A detailed discussion of how to diagnose acute HIV infection is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H18410709\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to HIV testing is based upon the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The rationale for the use of this algorithm is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/antibody</span> tests are better able to identify <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/early</span> infection compared with antibody-only tests, since they can detect HIV p24 antigen when antibody may not yet be present (eg, &quot;window period of acute HIV infection&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Early detection is important because of the high risk of transmission that precedes seroconversion and the potential opportunity to improve health outcomes with early antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Although HIV-2 is less common than HIV-1 in the United States, accounting for less than 0.2 percent of cases, this distinction has important implications for HIV treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hiv-2-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of HIV-2 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Using this algorithm, an HIV screening program at a Phoenix, Arizona emergency department identified 37 undiagnosed HIV infections from July 2011 to February 2013. Of these, 12 (32.4 percent) were acute HIV infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Another prospective evaluation of this algorithm (the STOP study) diagnosed 610 previously undiagnosed HIV infections, of which 55 were consistent with acute infection. Applying this new HIV testing algorithm averted missed diagnoses in 32 percent of the HIV-infected patients in the Phoenix emergency department and 9 percent of those in the STOP study.</p><p>Testing algorithms used in resource-limited settings are described elsewhere in this topic.

Although the accuracy of this testing algorithm for patients with chronic infection is extremely high (&gt;99 percent sensitivity and specificity), it can fail to diagnose individuals who are early in the course of their infection when antibody has not fully developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87673\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87673 \">table 1</a>). It can also misclassify HIV-2 infection, with approximately 60 percent of HIV-2 infections being misclassified as HIV-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Continued efforts are needed to improve all aspects of this treatment cascade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114330379\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued recommendations for HIV testing in low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. All testing must be voluntary and confidential. HIV testing efforts should also provide links to prevention, care, and treatment services. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Patient-related issues'</a> above.)</p><p>The WHO suggests that HIV testing be administered with a combination of two different rapid antibody tests. Rapid testing provides results at a single visit and reduces barriers to care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/8,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,86</a>]. The initial rapid test should be the most sensitive assay available.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial rapid test is negative, no further testing is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial rapid test is positive, a second rapid antibody test (from a different commercial source) should be used as a confirmatory test. If the initial test was done by self-testing, the patient should receive further testing from a trained tester using a validated national testing strategy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial test is positive and the second test does not confirm the result, the tests should be repeated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third antibody test should be used in certain scenarios, depending upon the prevalence of HIV in the population being tested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93415\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93415 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93414\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93414 \">figure 2</a>). The WHO defines &quot;low prevalence&quot; as HIV in &lt;5 percent of the population being tested, and &quot;high prevalence&quot; as HIV in &ge;5 percent of the population being tested.</p><p/><p>If a fourth-generation <span class=\"nowrap\">antibody/antigen</span> test is used as the initial rapid test, a negative confirmatory antibody test increases the suspicion for acute infection. Thus, the patient should have repeat HIV testing performed 14 days later.</p><p>In 2007, the WHO changed the focus from client-initiated testing to provider-initiated testing and counseling for patients in health facilities. In areas with generalized epidemics (ie, HIV is firmly established in the general population), HIV testing should be offered to patients in all clinical settings. Subsequent guidelines have advocated community-based HIV testing, testing by lay providers, self-testing, and voluntary assisted partner notification services (ie, where trained health workers offer HIV testing to partners of patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/8,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,87</a>].</p><p>The use of self-testing and voluntary assisted partner notification is supported by data from clinical trials that found an increased uptake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frequency of HIV testing among those who are at high risk for infection (eg, men who have sex with men [MSM], partners of HIV-positive individuals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

Improved access to HIV testing and new testing algorithms can decrease the number of individuals who present with advanced immunocompromise, enhance the detection of newly infected individuals, and reduce transmission to others. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV testing should be performed to diagnose HIV infection in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of acute or chronic infection, as well as those with a possible exposure to HIV. (See <a href=\"#H3198185622\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms of HIV infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H466086220\" class=\"local\">'Possible HIV exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without identifiable risk factors for HIV acquisition, we recommend one-time HIV screening in adults and adolescents 13 to 75 years of age rather than risk-based screening (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). HIV testing should also be performed for all pregnant women, even if they have been screened during previous pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H1254169412\" class=\"local\">'Routine screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H384998360\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for routine screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with ongoing high-risk behaviors (eg, men who have sex with men with sexual partners who are HIV-infected or have unknown serostatus, injection-drug users, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, sex partners of persons who are HIV-infected) annual or more frequent screening should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H1254169412\" class=\"local\">'Routine screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For routine HIV screening and diagnosis, we use a fourth-generation combination <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV-1/2</span> immunoassay that detects HIV p24 antigen <strong>and</strong> HIV antibodies; if positive, a confirmatory <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV-1/HIV-2</span> antibody differentiation immunoassay should be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91270\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91270 \">algorithm 1</a>). The combination <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/antibody</span> tests are better able to identify <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/early</span> infection compared with antibody-only tests, since they can detect HIV p24 antigen at a time when antibody may not yet be present. (See <a href=\"#H2898308609\" class=\"local\">'Preferred approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3828426\" class=\"local\">'Tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is concern for acute HIV infection (eg, the patient presents with mononucleosis-like symptoms and had a recent high-risk exposure), additional testing with HIV RNA (either qualitative or quantitative) should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H18410709\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indeterminate test results occur when the initial screening test is positive (ie, third-generation antibody assay or fourth-generation combination assay) and the confirmatory test <span class=\"nowrap\">(HIV-1/HIV-2</span> differentiation assay or Western blot) is indeterminate or negative. An indeterminate test may result from recently acquired HIV infection or be the result of a false positive screening test. Plasma HIV RNA should be tested in all patients with an indeterminate test result. (See <a href=\"#H1139383765\" class=\"local\">'Indeterminate test results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV testing algorithms used in resource-limited settings involve a combination of two different rapid tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93415\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93415 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93414\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93414 \">figure 2</a>).
