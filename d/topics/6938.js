This process is caused by one of two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities arising from within the RBC <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its membrane (intracorpuscular defects). One can think of the RBC as having three compartments: hemoglobin, metabolic machinery to energize ion pumps and provide requisite reducing power, and a deformable elastic membrane. Abnormalities of these three compartments are usually congenital (eg, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis), but may rarely be acquired, as in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities in the environment of the RBC. These processes are, by definition, extracorpuscular, and the ensuing hemolysis is called extrinsic (extracorpuscular) hemolytic anemia.</p><p/><p>Extrinsic hemolytic anemia is often due to immune mechanisms, as in warm and cold agglutinin hemolytic anemia.

However, there are many nonimmune causes, including systemic diseases, mechanical destruction (ie, fragmentation hemolysis), increased destruction within an enlarged spleen (hypersplenism), and the action of toxins and drugs.</p><p>The systemic disorders associated with nonimmune extrinsic hemolytic anemia will be reviewed here, including infection, liver and renal diseases, and miscellaneous conditions such as anorexia nervosa.

Thus, the signs of intravascular hemolysis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased concentration of free hemoglobin in the plasma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of free hemoglobin in the urine (hemoglobinuria), which produces a red, heme-positive urine supernatant in association with red plasma.

However, serum haptoglobin is not a specific indicator of intravascular hemolysis since it can be low or absent with brisk extravascular hemolysis as well as in the rare inherited condition anhaptoglobinemia. Another problem is that haptoglobin is an acute phase reactant; thus, serum concentrations in patients with concomitant infection or inflammation may be normal in the presence of hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection causes extrinsic nonimmune hemolytic anemia through several different mechanisms. These include direct parasitization (eg, malaria, bartonellosis), damage due to the release of bacterial products (eg, Clostridium perfringens and Haemophilus influenzae type b), and the induction of hypersplenism (eg, malaria).</p><p>Infection is also a major cause of immune hemolytic anemia, as in cold agglutinin hemolysis following an episode of infectious mononucleosis or mycoplasma pneumonia and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, usually following a viral infection in children.

These sporozoites are injected into the bloodstream when a person is bitten by such a mosquito. The sporozoites home to the liver where, after one to two weeks, they become merozoites. The merozoites multiply and lyse the hepatocytes to regain entrance to the bloodstream. The merozoites are then capable of parasitizing the red blood cell. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a remarkable process, the parasite via its apical end and related organelles called rhopteries attaches to a specific receptor on the red cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For P. vivax, the Duffy blood group antigen is involved, while P. falciparum binds to sialic acid residues on the red cell surface that are on glycophorin A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protection against malaria by abnormalities in red cell surface antigens and cytoskeletal proteins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The red cell engulfs the parasite by a process resembling receptor-mediated endocytosis. The parasite then immediately co-opts the red cell's metabolic machinery, including the degradation and ingestion of hemoglobin. The merozoite grows and eventually bursts out of the red cell, allowing the cycle to begin anew.</p><p/><p>This and other mechanisms of anemia in malaria are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The definitive diagnosis is made by finding the parasites on examination of the blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77517\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77517 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment consists of antimalarial drugs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimalarial-drugs-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimalarial drugs: An overview&quot;</a>). In addition, support of erythropoiesis in the form of replacement of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> and iron should be instituted, since many patients are malnourished in the face of chronic infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Bartonellosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bartonellosis occurs when a bite from the sandfly injects Bartonella bacilliformis. This parasite also attaches to the red cell surface and causes lysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=south-american-bartonellosis-oroya-fever-and-verruga-peruana\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;South American bartonellosis: Oroya fever and verruga peruana&quot;</a>.) It appears that the invasion of red cells is partly dependent upon the flagella of bartonellae. Evidence in support of this hypothesis comes from experiments that show that incubation with antiflagellin antiserum reduces invasion of the red cell by the parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This traditional view of Bartonella infection is countered by a study showing that B. henselae neither binds to nor invades the mature red cell. Rather, the organism invades and persists in hematopoietic progenitor cells and can be found in erythroid progenitors, whose differentiation is unaffected by the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Babesiosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Babesia belongs to the family of malaria-like organisms called Piroplasmorida. It is a tick-transmitted zoonosis endemic in the Northeast and upper Midwest of the United States. The tick vector is Ixodes scapularis, which may also transmit Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Babesia organisms can be seen invading red blood cells on examination of the peripheral smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56898\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56898 \">picture 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These organisms do not produce pigment, which can help to distinguish them from malaria. Babesiosis can occur in immunocompetent individuals, but is most severe in immunocompromised or asplenic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].

However, this does not appear to occur by direct parasitization. Rather, the hemolytic anemia in visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) may be in part due to the generation of oxidative metabolic products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is believed that patients with kala-azar have deficiencies in enzymes that are protective against oxidative damage. Experimental evidence for this comes from studies showing that infection of hamsters with L. donovani results in an increase in methemoglobin concurrent with a decrease in enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial products causing hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most dramatic example of hemolysis associated with bacterial infection is clostridial infection, but a similar problem can occur with Haemophilus influenzae type b.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Clostridium perfringens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clostridium perfringens (formerly known as C. Welchii) releases enzymes that acutely degrade the phospholipids of the red cell membrane bilayer and the structural membrane proteins. Phospholipase C (alpha toxin) is the toxin thought most likely to be implicated in the hemolysis associated with clostridial infection. In one case report, the serum phospholipase C concentration increased fivefold over four hours, the period of time from presentation to death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other enzymes elaborated by C. perfringens, including neuraminidase and T-lectin, were not elevated in a similar manner, suggesting the dominant role of phospholipase C. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridial-myonecrosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridial myonecrosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The signs of clostridial infection may be obvious, but fever may be unimpressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Any site of infection can be associated with septicemia and massive hemolysis, but a local source of infection may not be apparent.

Severely affected patients, particularly those with meningitis, have developed hemolytic anemias requiring red cell transfusions. The capsular polysaccharide of the bacterium, composed of polyribosyl ribosyl phosphate (PRP) is released during infection and binds to the red cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Infected patients develop antibodies to PRP. When the balance between PRP-coated red cells and anti-PRP antibodies is correct, an immune hemolysis requiring complement occurs. Red cell destruction is thought to be both intravascular and extravascular.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several mechanisms of hemolysis associated with liver disease, and more than one may be implicated in an individual patient. The two major causes are hypersplenism and acquired alterations in the red cell membrane. The latter can produce characteristic changes on the peripheral blood smear, as discussed below.</p><p>Hemolysis is usually mild and may be one of many factors that can cause anemia in this setting. Patients with liver disease often have decreased red cell production secondary to nutritional deficiencies, the anemia of chronic disease, increased blood loss secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, from varices), and generalized blood loss due to a more generalized coagulopathy.

When sufficiently enlarged, the spleen causes anemia because of both sequestration of red blood cells and increased destruction and clearance. The degree of hemolysis and anemia is proportional to the magnitude of the splenomegaly.

The second step involves extensive remodeling of the red cell in the spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. On occasion, spur cell hemolytic anemia is severe enough to necessitate consideration of splenectomy. The operative morbidity in such cases is considerable, because the underlying alcoholism usually produces problems with leukopenia, quantitative and qualitative platelet defects, coagulopathy, and intolerance to anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the patient with liver disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;, section on 'Liver disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Echinocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echinocytes, also known as burr cells, are often confused with acanthocytes. However, the projections of the red cell membrane are smaller and more <strong>regular</strong> in shape and distribution in echinocytes. Echinocytes can be readily appreciated on examination of &quot;wet prep&quot; peripheral smears in most patients with liver disease, but they are not usually apparent on dried blood smears (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62090\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62090 \">picture 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These cells can be seen in conditions other than liver disease, including end-stage renal disease, hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and long-distance runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of spiculated cells (echinocytes and acanthocytes) and target cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Echinocytes do not share the abnormal lipid composition of the red cell membrane seen in acanthocytes. Rather, echinocytes seem to be produced by a material in the patient's plasma that causes normal red cells to become echinocytic. This material is an abnormal high-density lipoprotein that deposits on the outer surface of the red cell membrane and induces the characteristic conformational changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55556 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Echinocytes per se do not necessarily have a shortened red cell survival. Some forms of echinocytic red cells are normally deformable when studied in the ektacytometer or rheoscope. Thus, it appears that other mechanisms are responsible for the hemolysis seen in the diverse disorders associated with echinocytosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Stomatocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stomatocytes can occur in severe liver disease, particularly alcoholic liver disease, and other conditions such as acute ethanol intoxication. In some patients with alcoholism, for example, stomatocytes can account for more than 10 percent of peripheral red blood cells (normal less than 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Stomatocytosis is defined by the appearance on the peripheral smear of erythrocytes with a mouth-shaped area of central pallor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75535 \">picture 7</a>). The stomatocyte is a cell that conceptually is an intermediate in the formation of a spherocyte (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55556 \">figure 1</a>). The reduction in surface <span class=\"nowrap\">area/volume</span> ratio leads to trapping in the microvasculature of the spleen and other organs of the <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophage</span> system, producing varying degrees of hemolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stomatocytosis and xerocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Other mechanisms in liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver disease, and most notably alcohol intoxication, can be associated with nonimmune hemolysis by mechanisms unrelated to hypersplenism or the above morphologic changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2993750360\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypophosphatemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe hypophosphatemia generally reflects inadequate phosphate intake in the presence of adequate carbohydrate intake; the latter stimulates the release of insulin, which drives phosphate into the cells. Thus, the major settings in which severe hypophosphatemia is seen are refeeding of patients who are malnourished or have ketoacidosis, the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> in which phosphate intake is not carefully monitored, and the chronic ingestion of large amounts of phosphate binding antacids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Other forms of anemia also can occur, including blood loss via the gastrointestinal tract or during hemodialysis, as well as platelet dysfunction secondary to uremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyporesponse to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;, section on 'Uremia'</a>.)</p><p>Hemolysis also can occur in patients with renal disease by one of three mechanisms: fragmentation hemolysis associated with microvascular disease; the effects of uremic plasma; and the effects of hemodialysis. The first mechanism occurs with the thrombotic microangiopathies such as hemolytic uremic syndrome and malignant hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorpuscular non-immune hemolytic anemia: Fragmentation hemolysis and hypersplenism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Uremia per se may produce a significant but modest shortening of red cell survival. This may be due in part to increased osmotic fragility induced by uremic plasma, since the increase in predialysis osmotic fragility can be reversed by hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The mechanisms proposed for the increase in osmotic fragility included low molecular weight uremic toxins and increased serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone.</p><p>Patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis may be particularly susceptible to oxidative damage to their red blood cells. Red cell GSH (reduced glutathione) and the activity of the enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione peroxidase may be diminished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The ability of these red cells to deal with generation of peroxides is likely impaired, leading to increased susceptibility to hemolysis.</p><p>Hemodialysis itself has been implicated in sporadic causes of hemolysis. In the past, some patients treated with chronic hemodialysis were exposed to unusual concentrations of chloramine in the tap water that resulted in acute oxidative hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].
