A wide range of neurologic complications are associated with antineoplastic drug treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55758 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Their recognition is important because of potential confusion with metastatic disease, paraneoplastic syndromes, or comorbid neurologic disorders that do not require dose reduction or discontinuation.

Genetic polymorphisms in some enzymes responsible for cisplatin metabolism (eg, glutathione S-transferase) may contribute to some of the observed interindividual differences in the incidence and severity of neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Higher cisplatin dose intensity (ie, higher doses per unit time) does not appear to enhance the severity of the neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical and electrophysiologic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically, cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy is characterized by the subacute development of numbness, paresthesias (abnormal sensations), and occasionally pain, which usually begins in the toes and fingers, spreading proximally to affect the legs and arms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67516 \">table 2</a>). The earliest observable sign is a decreased vibratory sensitivity in the toes and loss of ankle jerks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although proprioception is impaired and reflexes are lost, pinprick, temperature sensation, and motor strength are usually spared, or less severely affected. Autonomic neuropathies are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>More prolonged treatment may worsen symptoms and signs with generalized loss of deep tendon reflexes, and more proximal vibratory sensory impairment. Lhermitte's sign, a shock-like sensation of paresthesias radiating from the back to the feet during neck flexion, is occasionally observed, typically after weeks or months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It has also been reported in patients receiving high cumulative doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>. Lhermitte's sign is believed to result from transient demyelination of the posterior columns. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin'</a> below.)</p><p>Nerve conduction studies show sensory axonal damage with decreased amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) and prolonged sensory latencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Motor nerve conduction velocities and compound muscle action potentials are typically unchanged during treatment. On sural nerve biopsy, both demyelination and axonal loss are evident.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201465877\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis includes paraneoplastic neuropathies and those associated with autoimmune disorders. Paraneoplastic neuropathies usually involve all sensory fibers, and there may be an antineuronal antibody (anti-Hu) in the serum. Patients with autoimmune neuropathies often have clinical features of an underlying connective tissue disease, and autoantibodies are usually present in the serum. Tetany in the hands and feet resulting from cisplatin-related electrolyte imbalance (ie, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia) may also be confused with peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may sometimes be confused with those of hand-foot syndrome (acral erythema), which can occasionally be seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-side-effects-of-conventional-chemotherapy-agents#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous side effects of conventional chemotherapy agents&quot;, section on 'Hand-foot syndrome (acral erythema)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve and muscle disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting peripheral nerve and muscle&quot;, section on 'Subacute sensory neuronopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Exocrine gland disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109349878\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major site of pathology is the dorsal root ganglion. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cisplatin</a> (and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin'</a> below)) enters into the dorsal root ganglion and binds to nuclear <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mitochondrial DNA, causing apoptosis. There are two main mechanisms proposed to explain the pathophysiology of platinum-induced peripheral neuropathy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platinum compounds form intrastrand adducts and interstrand crosslinks that alter the tertiary structure of the DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. This effect on DNA promotes alterations in cell-cycle kinetics, which leads to an attempt of differentiated postmitotic dorsal root ganglion neurons to re-enter the cell cycle, which leads to the induction of apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxaliplatin</a> forms fewer platinum-DNA adducts than does <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, and thus is slightly less neurotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second mechanism proposes involvement of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction as the trigger of neuronal apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p>Regardless of the mechanism, apoptosis results in secondary damage to peripheral nerves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201465946\"><span class=\"h3\">Natural history, prevention, and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no effective preventive strategies.

Sometimes, a patient can be switched to an alternative, less neurotoxic agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>) if this is consistent with the goals of care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-the-initial-management-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-without-a-driver-mutation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for the initial management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer without a driver mutation&quot;, section on 'Cisplatin versus carboplatin'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy#H281026902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy&quot;, section on 'Carboplatin'</a>.)</p><p>Even if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> is discontinued, the neuropathy continues to worsen for several months in 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Neuropathy may even begin after therapy is discontinued. It eventually improves in most patients, although recovery is often incomplete. In a study of long-term testicular cancer survivors who had completed treatment at least five years previously, peripheral neuropathy was still present in 20 percent, and 10 percent were symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Higher levels of residual serum platinum, which can persist for years after treatment, appear to correlate with the severity of long-term peripheral neuropathy in cisplatin-treated survivors of testicular cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In another report, factors that were related to a high risk for persistent neuropathy included age at diagnosis, smoking history, excess alcohol use, hypertension, and heritable factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>For some patients with platinum-induced neuropathy, pain is a prominent symptom. Amelioration of symptoms from the chronic neuropathy, including pain, may be achieved through use of antidepressants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>. For symptomatic patients who fail to respond to duloxetine, other adjuvant analgesics (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants), opioids, physical modalities such as cutaneous electrical stimulation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interventional procedures may be indicated. Symptomatic treatment for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Hearing loss was defined according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) criteria as a hearing threshold at any frequency (0.25 to 12 kHz) that exceeded 20 dB for either ear. At a median 51 months following chemotherapy, hearing loss was found in 80 percent of the survivors, and 18 percent had severe or profound hearing loss. Increasing cumulative cisplatin dose (median 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>;</span> range 200 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> was significantly related to hearing loss at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 kHz. Every 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> increase in cumulative dose resulted in a 3.2 dB impairment in age-adjusted overall hearing threshold, and cumulative cisplatin doses &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> were associated with greater severity of hearing loss than were lower doses (odds ratio 1.59, p = 0.0066).
