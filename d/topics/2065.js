In addition, prenatal exposure to these medications, particularly valproate, is associated with developmental delay and lower intelligence quotient scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-women-preconception-and-prenatal-maintenance-pharmacotherapy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Specific drugs suggested as preconception and prenatal maintenance treatment and the teratogenic effects of valproate and carbamazepine are discussed separately.

Valproate or carbamazepine are tapered and discontinued over 15 to 30 days; this approach appears to be associated with a lower risk of recurrence than a faster taper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-women-preconception-and-prenatal-maintenance-pharmacotherapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The medication is tapered by the same amount for each dose decrease. As an example, valproate 2000 mg per day is decreased by 250 to 500 mg per day, every three to seven days. At the same time, the new medication is started and titrated up. </p><p>Alternative medications may not work as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, and switching medications can precipitate a recurrence of bipolar mood symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-women-preconception-and-prenatal-maintenance-pharmacotherapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, it is reasonable to maintain valproate or carbamazepine for patients with a history of poor outcomes using other medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>.

Particular attention is given to suicidal ideation and to psychotic symptoms. Stable patients can be seen every one to two months. For patients who remit from an acute mood episode and remain stable, monitoring can be tapered, with progressively longer intervals between assessments. As an example, a patient who is seen every two weeks at the time of remission can be seen every two weeks for one to three more visits, then every one to two months until parturition. More frequent visits should be scheduled for patients who develop symptoms or side effects; monitoring acutely ill patients is discussed separately.

Although no head-to-head trials have compared these psychotherapies, we generally choose psychoeducation because there are more data supporting its use, it is easier to administer than CBT and thus usually more available, and psychoeducation is generally an element of CBT. The evidence of efficacy for reducing recurrent mood episodes with other psychotherapies, such as family therapy and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, is not as strong.

Although there are more data supporting the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> than lamotrigine for the general maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, the reproductive safety of lamotrigine is generally regarded as comparable or superior to lithium. </p><p>Serum concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> should be measured prior to conception or as soon as possible in patients who present during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-women-preconception-and-prenatal-maintenance-pharmacotherapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Two prospective observational studies of pregnant bipolar patients (N = 89 and 26) found that the pregnancy was not planned in 34 and 58 percent, and that unplanned pregnancy was associated with recurrent prenatal mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-women-preconception-and-prenatal-maintenance-pharmacotherapy/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>]. </p><p>For euthymic bipolar patients who unintentionally become pregnant during maintenance treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, a second-generation antipsychotic, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, we suggest continuing the same drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-women-preconception-and-prenatal-maintenance-pharmacotherapy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>For bipolar patients who are maintained on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> and unexpectedly become pregnant, we suggest switching medications. We typically titrate up the new drug as rapidly as tolerated, and then taper and discontinue the antiepileptic over the course of a few days. The antiepileptic is decreased the same amount for each dose reduction. As an example, valproate 1500 mg per day is decreased by 500 mg every one to two days. The choice of a new drug is discussed elsewhere in this topic, as is management of patients who decline switching medications.

However, stopping medications (particularly over a period of less than two weeks) may increase the risk of recurrent mood episodes.

The period of greatest risk for the teratogenic effects of medications is between the third and eighth week of gestation (weeks of gestation are counted from the first day of the last menstrual period) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65816\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65816 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56642 \">figure 2</a>).
