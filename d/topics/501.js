There are currently four acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies: Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of high-grade pathologic type and of B cell or unknown immunologic phenotype, primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCL), and invasive cervical carcinoma. AIDS-related NHL is generally divided into three types: systemic NHL, PCL, and the primary effusion (&quot;body cavity&quot;) lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. More unusual types, such as plasmablastic lymphoma, also occur. These disorders are primarily encountered in patients with more advanced HIV infection, with a CD4 count that is usually below <span class=\"nowrap\">100/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Reviews of the diagnosis and treatment of PCL not associated with HIV infection are presented separately. Although central nervous system (CNS) involvement also occurs in AIDS-related systemic lymphoma in the form of secondary spread of the tumor to the meninges, the disease is limited to the CNS in PCL. Evaluation of the CNS in patients with AIDS-related systemic lymphoma is discussed separately.

The most common histology is diffuse large B cell lymphoma (immunoblastic variant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The reported incidence of PCL in HIV-infected patients is 2 to 6 percent (at least 1000 times higher than in the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and has been as high as 10 percent in autopsy series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Risk factors for NHL in HIV-infected patients include low CD4 count, high HIV viral load, and chronic co-infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of PCL increases with prolonged survival from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection and requires a more severe degree of immunosuppression than most other acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complications; the CD4 counts in affected patients are generally less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. Thus, PCL is rarely an initial AIDS-defining illness.</p><p>PCL can present with a variety of focal or nonfocal signs and symptoms. The clinical presentation may be characterized by confusion, lethargy, memory loss, hemiparesis, aphasia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seizures that have usually been present for less than three months. Compared with non-AIDS patients with PCL, patients with AIDS are more likely to present with mental status changes and seizures (50 versus 35 percent in a literature review) and less likely to have increased intracranial pressure (14 versus 32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Constitutional symptoms (systemic &quot;B&quot; symptoms) occur in over 80 percent of patients with PCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) disease should be evaluated with imaging. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher diagnostic yield, computed tomography (CT) scan may also be used. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of CNS lesions in patients with AIDS are ultimately found to be PCL with toxoplasmosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy accounting for many of the remaining cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>If there is a mass lesion or lesions (approximately one-half of patients with PCL have multiple lesions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16</a>], the usual next step is to distinguish between PCL and toxoplasmosis, the other common cause of intracranial mass lesions in HIV-infected patients. This distinction can be made using a combination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology, toxoplasmosis serologic testing, an empiric trial of antibiotics, measurement of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in a CSF sample, and, if necessary, brain biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to HIV-infected patients with central nervous system lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">CT scan and MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On CT scan, a PCL is typically a well-defined focal lesion, isodense or hyperdense to the gray matter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68209\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68209 \">image 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Calcification, hemorrhage, and cysts are unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In one series, all lesions were isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted images, while hypointense, isointense, or hyperintense lesions could be seen on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In the absence of corticosteroid therapy, AIDS-related PCLs show a high degree of enhancement on both CT and MRI following intravenous contrast injection. The enhancement is typically irregular and inhomogeneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>], a finding that is unusual in the HIV-seronegative population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This difference is due to the more rapid growth rate of AIDS-related intracranial lymphomas, resulting in a high degree of central necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>].</p><p>Location, size, and the presence or absence of mass effect may also be helpful diagnostically.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions that involve the corpus callosum, periventricular, or periependymal areas are more likely to be due to a lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18</a>]. Less than 10 percent of lymphomas involve the posterior fossa; thus, posterior fossa lesions are more likely to be due to an infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions that are more than 4 cm in size are more likely to be due to lymphoma than an infectious process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCL and toxoplasmosis usually produce a mass effect on CT or MRI. In one series of HIV-infected patients with focal brain lesions, the probability of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was 81 percent among those without a mass effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Corticosteroids are often given when a symptomatic mass lesion is identified. This has important implications for further evaluation since significant shrinkage of the tumor can occur within only a few days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]. Steroid therapy can convert enhancing into nonenhancing lesions, and biopsy in this situation may yield only necrotic or nondiagnostic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, in the absence of severe manifestations, such as cerebral herniation, the evaluation of an intracranial mass should be done <strong>prior</strong> to the administration of steroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to HIV-infected patients with central nervous system lesions&quot;, section on 'Corticosteroids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">SPECT scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several agents being investigated in HIV-infected patients with intracranial mass lesions include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> and 99Tc(m)-sestamibi SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In a comparative study of 17 patients, both had sensitivity of 100 percent, but thallium had a lower specificity (54 versus 69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Medical treatment of toxoplasmosis, with a healing pattern on biopsy, was an important cause of the false positive results.</p><p>Several subsequent studies suggest that specificity can be improved with better quantitation and evaluation of delayed images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. One report, for example, evaluated thallium uptake on early and late images and calculated the retention index of thallium in 49 patients with AIDS who presented with focal lesions on CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The absence of thallium uptake on early images excluded the diagnosis of lymphoma with a high degree of confidence. In the presence of early uptake, delayed imaging and calculation of the retention index were necessary to distinguish lymphoma from nonmalignant lesions. The overall sensitivity was 96 percent. Specificity was 76 percent by counting all studies with abnormal thallium uptake but increased to 100 percent when the retention index was also considered.</p><p>Another possible method to increase the specificity is to combine imaging with measurement of EBV DNA in a cerebrospinal fluid sample. One study considered the value of combined thallium SPECT and measurement of EBV DNA in 13 patients with PCL and 18 patients with non-tumor disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The presence of increased uptake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positive EBV DNA had 100 percent sensitivity and almost 100 percent negative predictive value, suggesting that brain biopsy could be avoided in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Detection of EBV DNA'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Establishing the diagnosis of cerebral mass lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar puncture is relatively noninvasive and may provide a diagnosis of PCL. In the HIV-seronegative population, the yield of CSF cytology for diagnosis of PCL is only 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The incidence of positive CSF cytology in AIDS-related PCL is as yet unknown, but since meningeal involvement in AIDS-related PCL is 25 to 35 percent it is likely that the diagnostic yield of CSF cytology may be similar to that in the HIV-seronegative population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, and diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Cerebrospinal fluid analysis'</a>.)</p><p>If CSF cytology does not establish the diagnosis, toxoplasma serologies should be obtained. Most patients are treated empirically with antitoxoplasma therapy, while serology is pending. Patients with a positive serology can be treated for two weeks before stereotactic biopsy; a response to therapy obviates the need for biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26</a>]. However, this approach may delay appropriate therapy for other disorders. In one series, the probability of toxoplasmic encephalitis in seropositive patients with a mass effect was 87 percent in those not receiving antitoxoplasma prophylaxis and only 59 percent in those receiving prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The optimal management of patients who are seronegative for toxoplasmosis is uncertain. Such patients can be treated empirically or, because of the potential for rapid, clinical deterioration, undergo early brain biopsy. Evaluation of this issue by formal decision analysis supported early biopsy in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In one series, the likelihood of PCL was 74 percent in seronegative patients with a mass effect on imaging studies; this value increased to 96 percent if EBV DNA was detected in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decision-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Decision analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stereotactic brain biopsy is an effective diagnostic procedure in HIV-infected patients with focal brain lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/15,17,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,27</a>]. The safety and yield of this technique was evaluated in a retrospective review of 435 HIV-seropositive patients presenting with focal intracranial lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The postbiopsy morbidity within 30 days was 8.4 percent and mortality was 2.9 percent. Similar values (12 percent morbidity and 2 percent mortality) were noted in another report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but the risk is likely to vary with local expertise.</p><p>A definitive diagnosis was obtained by brain biopsy in 88 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCL &mdash; 30 percent overall but 65 percent in those biopsied after failure of antitoxoplasma therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) &mdash; 25 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxoplasmosis &mdash; 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &mdash; 17 percent; as an example, primary intracranial tumors (such as gliomas) can occur in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]</p><p/><p>It is likely that these percentages are changing since the advent of antitoxoplasma chemoprophylaxis has led to a decline in toxoplasmic encephalitis as a cause of focal brain lesions and a relative increase in PCL and PML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Detection of EBV DNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of evidence demonstrates that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is central to the pathobiology of AIDS-related PCL with the absence of EBV-specific CD4+ T cell effector function likely contributing to the development of PCL in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The link to EBV infection has provided a basis for non-invasive detection of PCL in that a possible alternative to brain biopsy in patients who are seronegative for toxoplasmosis is the detection of EBV DNA in the CSF, usually by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It can also be performed in seropositive patients who are receiving a trial of antibiotics. While the detection of EBV DNA in CSF by PCR may be a useful tool to exclude the diagnosis of AIDS-related PCL, there remains an unmet need for biomarkers with greater specificity and predictive value for active PCL arising in the setting of HIV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathobiology#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathobiology&quot;, section on 'EBV co-infection'</a>.)</p><p>EBV analysis of CSF has a sensitivity of 80 to 90 percent, and a specificity that approaches 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. For example, in one series of HIV-infected patients with focal brain lesions, EBV DNA sequences were detected in 24 of 30 patients (80 percent) with PCL, compared with none of 61 patients without PCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In another report, the probability of PCL in toxoplasma-seronegative patients with a mass effect increased from 74 percent overall to more than 96 percent if EBV DNA were present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>However, as with other tests, the positive predictive value depends upon the prevalence of disease within the population. Several investigators have demonstrated the poor predictive value of quantitative EBV DNA in the CSF of HIV-infected patients and correlate its association with miscellaneous neurological diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. As an example, EBV DNA was detected by PCR in the CSF of 7 out of 26 HIV-infected patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Notably, only two of the patients with EBV DNA detected in the CSF received a diagnosis of PCL; five had alternative diagnoses including HIV encephalopathy, toxoplasmosis encephalitis, and cryptococcoma. Moreover, none of these five patients went on to develop HIV-associated PCL over a median follow-up of 37 months. Thus, EBV DNA detection by PCR had a positive predictive value of 29 percent for the diagnosis of AIDS-associated PCL.</p><p>Measurement of EBV DNA may have value in patients in whom a brain biopsy may not be acceptable to the patient or the neurosurgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In the first study referred to above, measurement of EBV DNA would have allowed the diagnosis of 63 percent of the case patients and exclusion of PCL in 76 percent of the control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These numbers are lower than the sensitivity and specificity because the test could not be performed in some patients due to perceived danger of lumbar puncture. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group has agreed to use EBV DNA measurement as a surrogate for brain biopsy in a new treatment trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Measurement of EBV in DNA in CSF also provides a surrogate marker to monitor the response to therapy for PCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This was illustrated in a report of nine patients who underwent multimodality therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Whether this extends to radiation therapy for AIDS-related PCL is unclear.
