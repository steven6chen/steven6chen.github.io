Family members may recall specific therapies that patients have forgotten. In addition, adherence to antidepressants should be evaluated with nonjudgmental questions such as: &quot;Many patients forget to take their medication on a regular basis. How often does that happen to you?&quot; Patients with side effects may be especially prone to nonadherence.</p><p/><p>The treatment history for patients with major depression who may be treatment resistant is typically assessed through a clinical interview (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F90050\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90050 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], as well as a review of the medical record, which may provide more accurate information. The accuracy of patient recall is not clear, in light of conflicting results from retrospective observational studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 73 patients with major depression were interviewed about their treatment history for the past five years by a psychiatrist, who was blind to the actual history that was collected by an independent chart review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Among the 104 monotherapy trials that had occurred, patients recalled 82 percent. In addition, 94 percent of adequate (dose and duration) trials were correctly reported as such, and 90 percent of inadequate trials were correctly reported as inadequate. The presence of depressive symptoms did not adversely affect patient recall of past regimens. However, among the 46 augmentation trials that had occurred, patients recalled only 26 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second study, 269 patients completed surveys about their treatment during the past five years; results were checked against medical records that included baseline and follow-up Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 3</a>) scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Agreement between patient recall and the medical records was poor. As an example, among 77 patients who reported that a specific treatment either was not beneficial or was harmful, response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) occurred in 58 percent. Accuracy of recall was not improved by limiting the sample to patients reporting high confidence in accuracy of recall. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6075316\"><span class=\"h2\">Instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although treatment resistance in unipolar major depression can be assessed with various instruments rather than a clinical interview [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/11,30,73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,30,73,74</a>], this is not standard practice and it is not known whether these instruments improve treatment outcomes. &#160;</p><p>For clinicians who want to systematically assess treatment resistance beyond a review of the medical record, we suggest the self-report Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The questionnaire assesses the effectiveness of each antidepressant trial and whether the dose and duration were adequate. A validation study found that among 186 outpatients with unipolar major depression who were identified retrospectively as treatment resistant by the questionnaire, treatment resistance was confirmed by an interview with a psychiatrist in 100 percent of the patients. In addition, the number of prior antidepressant trials (adequate in dose and duration) that were identified as failures by the questionnaire and by the psychiatrist was concordant in 76 percent of the patients. Limitations of the questionnaire are that it does not inquire about adherence to treatment, discontinuation of medications due to adverse effects, or use of psychotherapy. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96382765\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prior treatment history in patients with treatment resistant depression can be staged along a continuum, according to the number and types of treatments that failed to resolve the depressive episode. However, there is no evidence that staging treatment resistance improves outcomes. In addition, staging is often regarded as cumbersome for standard practice and is thus reserved for specialized treatment or research settings. Multiple staging models have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/8,75-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,75-79</a>], and although studies are beginning to validate different models (eg, Maudsley Staging Method) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], it is not clear that one model is superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6075323\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although remission of unipolar major depression frequently does not occur after initial treatment, approximately 67 percent of patients eventually remit after one or more next step treatment trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, 3671 outpatients were prospectively treated with full doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>; nonresponders received up to three successive courses of treatment within a randomized trial, with each course lasting up to 14 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-treatment-resistant-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-risk-factors-assessment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
