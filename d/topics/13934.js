These antibodies are produced when fetal erythrocytes, which express an RBC antigen not expressed in the mother, gain access to the maternal circulation.</p><p>The postnatal diagnosis and management of alloimmune HDFN in the newborn will be reviewed here. The prenatal diagnosis and management of HDFN are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of non-Rhesus (D) red blood cell alloantibodies during pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Rhesus D alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF HDFN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alloimmune HDFN primarily involves the major blood groups of Rhesus (Rh), A, B, AB, and O, although minor blood group incompatibilities (Kell, Duffy, MNS, P, and Diego systems) can also result in significant disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102368\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102368 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Because of the low frequency of HDFN due to the minor blood groups, they are not presented in detail as part of this review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Only maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) causes HDFN, because transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta depends upon the fragment crystallizable (Fc) component of the IgG molecule, which is not present in immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-of-immunoglobulins#H8608107\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure of immunoglobulins&quot;, section on 'Antibody fragments'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Rh(D) hemolytic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals are classified as Rhesus (Rh) negative or positive based upon the expression of the major D antigen on the erythrocyte. The original description of HDFN was due to Rh(D) incompatibility, which is associated with the most severe form of the disease (hydrops fetalis).</p><p>Rh negative is the result of either an absence of the <em>RHD</em> gene (seen in Caucasians) or alterations in the <em>RHD</em> gene resulting in gene inactivation (seen in individuals of African ancestry). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies#H3139524982\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;, section on 'Rh blood group system'</a>.)</p><p>Maternal sensitization in an Rh(D)-negative individual is due to a previous exposure to Rh antigen, either through transfusion with Rh-positive red blood cells (RBCs) or pregnancy with an Rh-positive offspring. Thus, in the absence of transfusion, Rh HDFN generally does not occur in the first pregnancy. The introduction of antenatal Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> prophylaxis has significantly reduced alloimmune sensitization in pregnant women who are Rh(D) negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Rhesus (D) alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the affected neonate, clinical manifestations of Rh(D) HDFN range from mild, self-limited hemolytic disease to severe life-threatening anemia (eg, hydrops fetalis). The severity of HDFN increases with successive pregnancies. Hyperbilirubinemia usually occurs within the first 24 hours of life. (See <a href=\"#H1471026639\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below.)</p><p>However, in utero interventions for affected pregnancies, including intrauterine transfusions and early delivery, have reduced the severity of disease in the newborn, resulting in decreased neonatal morbidity and mortality rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Rhesus D alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">ABO hemolytic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans have four major blood groups in the ABO system (A, B, AB, and O). At approximately three to six months of age, individuals naturally begin to make A <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> B antibodies to the antigens (found ubiquitously in food and bacteria) they do not possess. As a result, ABO HDFN can occur with the first pregnancy and occurs almost exclusively in mothers with blood type O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Although ABO incompatibility occurs in approximately 15 percent of all pregnancies, it results in neonatal hemolytic disease in only 4 percent of such pregnancies (ie, 0.6 percent of all pregnancies). ABO hemolytic disease is more common and severe in infants of African descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Infants with ABO HDFN generally have less severe disease than those with Rh(D) incompatibility. Affected infants are usually asymptomatic at birth and have either no or mild anemia. They generally develop hyperbilirubinemia within the first 24 hours of birth. Phototherapy is usually sufficient therapy for most infants with ABO HDFN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hydrops fetalis is rare, and clinically significant hemolysis is uncommon, as less than 0.1 percent of infants with evidence of hemolysis will require exchange transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In one prospective study, maternal IgG anti-A and anti-B titers &gt;512 were associated with severe hyperbilirubinemia that required intervention (eg, phototherapy, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> [IVIG], or exchange transfusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Infants born to mothers with type O blood groups are more likely to have ABO incompatibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In some centers, blood typing and testing for antibody-mediated hemolysis is performed for every infant born to a mother with blood group O.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other blood group antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thirty-three total blood group systems, which include more than 300 antigens, are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). Several blood groups other than those of the ABO and Rh group are associated with HDFN and include Duffy, MNS, and P (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102368\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102368 \">table 1</a>). Antibodies may develop in response to exposure to these antigens from a previous transfusion or pregnancy or from exposure to bacteria or viruses that express these antigens. There are also racial differences in blood group antigen distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of non-Rhesus (D) red blood cell alloantibodies during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although Rh(D) incompatibility remains the most frequent cause of Rh HDFN, some of the other more than 44 Rh antigens, particularly E and C, have been associated with HDFN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102368\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102368 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The variability is, in part, dependent upon the blood group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102368\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102368 \">table 1</a>). In particular, anti-Kell HDFN can be severe and may require intrauterine intervention.

They may also have symptomatic anemia (eg, lethargy or tachycardia) but without signs of circulatory collapse. The degree of anemia varies depending upon the type of HDFN. Infants with ABO incompatibility generally have no or only minor anemia at birth. In contrast, infants with Rhesus (Rh) or some minor blood group incompatibilities can present with symptomatic anemia that requires red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Early anemia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957964524\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydrops fetalis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with severe life-threatening anemia (eg, hydrops fetalis) present with skin edema, pleural or pericardial effusion, or ascites. Infants with Rh(D) and some minor blood group incompatibilities, such as Kell, are at risk for hydrops fetalis, especially pregnancies without antenatal care. ABO HDFN is generally less severe than that caused by the Rh and Kell systems; however, there are case reports of hydrops fetalis due to ABO incompatibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Neonates with hydrops fetalis may present at delivery with shock or near shock and require emergent transfusion.

The normal absolute reticulocyte count in cord blood of term infants is 137.3&plusmn;33 x 10<sup>9 </sup>L, which corresponds to a reticulocyte fraction of 3.1&plusmn;0.75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Microspherocytosis (due to partial membrane loss) is commonly seen in the peripheral smear of infants with ABO alloimmune HDFN, but it is generally not seen in infants with Rh disease.</p><p/><p>The postnatal diagnosis of HDFN is confirmed in patients with suspected HDFN by demonstrating antibody-mediated hemolysis by <strong>either</strong> a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin test <span class=\"nowrap\">(DAT/IAT;</span> Coombs test). The cost of screening needs to be balanced with the benefit of identifying infants with incompatible blood types to their mothers, as they are at risk for both severe hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In our practice, we suggest that all infants born to a type O mother be tested to identify their blood type and a DAT performed, as they are at risk for HDFN. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'ABO hemolytic disease'</a> above.)</p><p>A negative DAT does not exclude the diagnosis of HDFN, particularly in the setting of ABO incompatibility or intrauterine transfusions to manage Rh(D) alloantibodies during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive DAT demonstrates the presence of maternal antibody on the neonate's RBCs.

In addition, the antigenic sites are fewer and farther apart on neonatal RBCs, making agglutination with the Coombs reagent more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the DAT is negative, an elution is performed on the infant's RBCs to free any bound maternal antibodies into the serum, then an IAT is performed with the eluted serum. In IAT, RBCs with a specific antigen, such as Rh(D), A, or B, are incubated with the infant's serum. Antibodies to the specific antigen will adhere to the RBCs. The RBCs are then washed and suspended in serum containing anti-human globulin (Coombs serum). Agglutination of red cells coated with maternal antibody indicates the presence of free maternal antibodies in the neonatal serum and a positive IAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In infants with Rh HDFN who have received intrauterine transfusions, the DAT may be negative because the presence of donor Rh-negative RBCs makes agglutination more difficult. In contrast, the IAT will remain strongly positive.</p><p/><p>Cord blood is often used to identify the infant's blood type and perform DAT. However, a false positive DAT may occur due to contamination of the cord blood sample with Wharton's jelly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, it is not clear whether cord blood testing is less reliable than testing samples obtained directly from the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. It appears that cord blood samples stored for seven or more days are unreliable. In most cases, confirmation of cord blood testing should be done with specimens obtained directly from the infant.</p><p>In infants with suspected ABO hemolytic disease with both a negative DAT and IAT of the infant's eluted serum, other causes for hyperbilirubinemia should be sought. Specifically, evaluations for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency, and the <em>UGT1A1</em> gene promoter associated with Gilbert syndrome should be performed.

Affected infants are usually asymptomatic at birth and develop hyperbilirubinemia within the first 24 hours of birth. Anemia is usually either absent or mild. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'ABO hemolytic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The clinical disease associated with HDFN due to other blood groups ranges from mild (hyperbilirubinemia) to severe manifestations, including hydrops fetalis. In particular, anti-Kell HDFN can be severe and may require intrauterine intervention. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Other blood group antibodies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of non-Rhesus (D) red blood cell alloantibodies during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDFN is clinically suspected if there is documented hemolysis based on a peripheral blood smear in a neonate and incompatibility of blood types between the mother and her infant. The diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of antibody-mediated hemolysis either by a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin tests <span class=\"nowrap\">(DAT/IAT;</span> Coombs test). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for HDFN includes other causes of neonatal jaundice <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anemia. Alloimmune HDFN is differentiated from these disorders by the presence of a positive DAT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IAT. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of anemia varies in infants with HDFN. Anemia may present at birth (early) or not until one to three weeks of age (late). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antenatal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In infants with HDFN, hyperbilirubinemia generally presents within the first 24 hours of life.

Selection of RBCs for transfusion depends on the type of HDFN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97838 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In these patients, the choice between exchange and simple transfusion is based upon the following considerations (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Early anemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hyperbilirubinemia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If an infant has findings suggestive of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and hyperbilirubinemia, we recommend an exchange transfusion be performed (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If an infant has severe anemia and hyperbilirubinemia without signs of ABE, we suggest performing an exchange transfusion for hematocrit &lt;25 percent or based upon the bilirubin threshold levels as outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68219 \">figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-newborn-hyperbilirubinemia-assessment\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the hyperbilirubinemia is not severe and the symptoms of anemia are moderate, we suggest performing a simple transfusion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A simple transfusion may be performed if there is a delay in performing an exchange transfusion.
