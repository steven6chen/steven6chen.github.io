However, surgery alone provides a high cure rate only for patients with early stage (stage I (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>)) disease. </p><p>Many randomized trials have attempted to improve the results of surgery alone through the addition of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT), both before and after surgery. RT has emerged as an important component of adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer because of the distinct patterns of failure following resection. In contrast to colon cancer, in which the failure pattern is predominantly distant metastases, the site of first failure in patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer is equally distributed locally (ie, pelvis) and in distant sites (eg, liver, lung) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The majority of early trials of combined modality therapy in rectal cancer evaluated postoperative RT with or without chemotherapy. More recently, focus has shifted to preoperative (neoadjuvant) application of combined chemoradiotherapy. Neoadjuvant rather than adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is preferred for patients with transmural <span class=\"nowrap\">(T3/4)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>) or node-positive tumors, particularly if they are low-lying within the rectum. Advantages of this approach include better local control, increased likelihood of sphincter saving surgery, and a lower risk of chronic anastomotic stricture.

Among patients with stage II colon cancer, gene expression tests, such as the 12-gene recurrence score assay (Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay), are used to further refine prognostic stratification beyond that possible with conventional clinicopathologic features, and assist in decisions about adjuvant chemotherapy.

The utility of the 12-gene recurrence score in rectal cancer was addressed in a study of 297 patients who were enrolled on the Dutch Total Mesorectal excision (TME) trial, and mainly treated with surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Overall, 182 patients died, including 120 who died after a recurrence of rectal cancer.</p><p>In the entire cohort, which included patients with stage II and III disease, the recurrence score significantly predicted the risk of recurrence, including distant recurrence and rectal cancer-specific survival, after controlling for stage and resection margin status. The effect was most prominent in stage II patients, in whom the five-year cumulative incidence of recurrence ranged from 11 percent in the low recurrence score group (&lt;30, 49 percent of the total patients with stage II disease) to 27 percent with intermediate risk scores (31 to 40), and 43 percent in the high recurrence score group (&ge;41).</p><p>Several caveats must be considered when interpreting these results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This is a relatively small sample size. Furthermore, only 297 of the 583 patients enrolled in the trial were analyzed by this test, introducing the possibility of bias. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recurrence score was useful for predicting which stage II patients had a very low incidence of recurrence, and thus, which stage II patients might be candidates for not receiving adjuvant therapy. However, caution is advised against using the recurrence score as a deciding factor to go straight to surgery for clinical stage II patients until prospective trials are performed to test this strategy. There are no absolutely reliable clinical staging methods that accurately predict node positivity prior to surgery since many positive nodes are &lt;5 mm in diameter. In addition, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound may be relatively accurate at predicting a margin-negative resection, they are not perfect. Preoperative RT is associated with improved outcomes (efficacy and toxicity) when compared with postoperative RT and is indicated in patients with node-positive tumors, or where a margin-positive resection is a concern.

For patients who do not have a TME, chemoradiotherapy is especially important to minimize the risk of local recurrence. For patients with margin-negative T3N0 tumors after a TME who did not have preoperative chemoradiotherapy, and who wish to avoid the potential toxicity of postoperative RT, especially in women who aspire to bear children, the 12-gene recurrence score can be used to stratify individuals into higher versus lower risk categories.

It is generally <strong>not</strong> appropriate to treat rectal tumors with anteroposterior-posteroanterior (AP-PA) fields alone. Since the anterior structures, which receive high dose, are not substantially at risk for local failure, the two-field technique results in increased treatment-related toxicity without significant improvement in local control. At our institution, we generally treat patients with a four-field box technique, although a three-field with right and left lateral fields and a posterior field is also reasonable. The use of lateral fields permits sparing of a portion of the bladder and some anteriorly placed small bowel.</p><p>The AP-PA fields extend from approximately the lower level of the L5 vertebral body to 4 to 5 cm below the anastomosis (or below the tumor when treating preoperatively) in patients with a low anterior resection (LAR). For patients with an abdominoperineal resection (APR), the fields always extend to include the perineum. There are a substantial number of local recurrences in the perineum, and this area needs to be in the high dose volume. Laterally, the fields extend approximately 1 to 1.5 cm beyond the bony pelvis so that the lateral pelvic soft tissue receives the full radiation dose. The lateral fields have the same cephalad and caudad extent as the AP-PA fields.</p><p>Patients are treated in a prone position. The posterior border of the lateral field extends beyond the bony sacrum so that the full dose is delivered to the presacral space, a common site of local failure. Anteriorly, the fields extend to adequately cover the original tumor with at least a 2 cm margin. Blocks can often be used to spare a portion of the femoral neck on the lateral fields.</p><p>The bladder should be full during treatment so as to push some of the small intestine out of the radiation treatment volume. When the perineum needs to be treated, a bolus is placed on it so that a full dose will be delivered to the scar in this region. A bolus is a material with similar density to tissue that is placed directly on the skin surface. The beam then strikes the absorbing surface at the bolus, whose thickness is calculated so that the maximum dose to the target volume occurs closer to the skin surface. If the reaction becomes marked, the bolus can be removed. Perineal reactions do not typically produce major symptoms.</p><p>Patients are treated at 1.8 Gy, five fractions per week, to a total dose of 45 Gy to these fields. The field size is then reduced and a boost dose is delivered to the tumor bed. Prior to designing the boost field, a special small bowel radiographic series is obtained to define the exact location of the small bowel with respect to the boost area. Only by knowing the exact bowel position can one design the treatment volumes to minimize excess irradiation of the small intestine.</p><p>Great effort is made to avoid doses greater than 45 Gy to any small bowel that is fixed in the pelvis. In this regard, it is helpful to have the surgeon (at the time of the initial surgical procedure) try to move the small intestine out of the pelvis. This can best be accomplished by reperitonealizing the pelvic floor. When this is not possible, a portion of omentum can be mobilized and swung over to cover the pelvic floor, or the uterus can be retroverted to accomplish the same purpose. Some centers have investigated the use of prostheses or artificial mesh, but these are still being investigated. These approaches are most important when treating patients after an abdominoperineal resection; after an LAR, the remaining rectum and colon prevent some small bowel from being immobilized deep in the pelvis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549577733\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

In contrast to colon cancer, in which the failure pattern is predominantly distant metastases, the site of first failure in patients undergoing surgery for rectal adenocarcinoma is equally distributed locally and in distant sites. This provides the rationale for combined modality adjuvant therapy utilizing a combination of radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy.

Advantages of this approach include better local control, increased likelihood of sphincter-saving surgery, and a lower risk of chronic anastomotic stricture. This approach is consistent with published consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). However, others disagree. Updated 2017 guidelines for the treatment of rectal cancer from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggest that neoadjuvant therapy is appropriate for transmural tumors with &gt;5 mm of extramural invasion, but that initial surgery is preferred for cases with &lt;5 mm of extramural invasion. (See <a href=\"#H520019\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommended approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following represents our approach to adjuvant therapy in patients with resected rectal cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who go directly to surgery, we suggest postoperative combined modality therapy (chemotherapy plus concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based pelvic RT) over surgery alone for patients with resected stage II and III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>) rectal cancer, even if a total mesorectal excision (TME) was performed (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with margin-negative T3N0 tumors after a TME who did not have preoperative chemoradiotherapy, and who wish to avoid the potential toxicity of postoperative RT, the 12-gene recurrence score can be used to stratify individuals into higher versus lower risk categories. For patients whose tumors are found to fit into the lower risk category who are willing to accept that the predictive test still harbors some uncertainty related to its validation, surveillance without postoperative chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone is an option. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Can adjuvant therapy be omitted in any patient with stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These recommendations are in keeping with consensus-based guidelines from the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2529\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>. However, others disagree with these indications for postoperative therapy. Updated year 2017 guidelines for treatment of rectal cancer from the ESMO recommend that postoperative chemoradiotherapy be used selectively after primary surgery for patients who have unexpected adverse histopathological features, including a <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/close</span> circumferential resection margin (&le;1 mm), perforation in the tumor area, pT4b disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>), incomplete TME, extranodal deposits (N1c disease), or nodal deposits with extracapsular spread close to the mesorectal fascia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113995 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Chemoradiotherapy may also be used for other cases with a high risk of local recurrence if preoperative RT has not been given. No specific recommendation is made for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing postoperative therapy, we recommend the concurrent use of a fluoropyrimidine as a radiation sensitizer during postoperative RT rather than RT alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). There are no trials directly comparing RT with and without a radiation sensitizer in this setting. This recommendation is based upon the lack of a survival benefit with adjuvant RT alone in randomized trials, and the results of the GITSG and NCCTG trials, which show a survival benefit with combined use of concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU)-based chemoradiotherapy plus chemotherapy (using regimens that are considered inferior by modern standards) over surgery alone. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'RT alone'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Early trials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During the five and one-half to six week course of irradiation, we suggest continuous infusion <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (225 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day) during the entire course of RT rather than bolus FU (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Infusional versus bolus FU'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> (825 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> twice daily, five days per week) is an acceptable substitute for infusional FU during concurrent chemoradiotherapy, particularly for patients for whom port placement is not an option. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Orally active fluoropyrimidines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend against use of an oxaliplatin-containing chemoradiotherapy regimen, given the data from the neoadjuvant setting that show greater toxicity and no evidence of added benefit over fluoropyrimidines alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H192757942\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Oxaliplatin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend a course of adjuvant chemotherapy after resection of a stage II or III rectal cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12278782\" class=\"local\">'Contribution of adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several regimens are acceptable, extrapolating from experience in adjuvant treatment of colon cancer. For patients who can tolerate it, in keeping with guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2529\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>, we suggest an oxaliplatin-containing regimen (FOLFOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50132 \">table 6</a>), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> (CAPOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61781\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61781 \">table 7</a>)) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, clinicians should be aware that the evidence that oxaliplatin-containing regimens are better than non-oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting of rectal cancer is limited. Options for non-oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy include weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">FU/LV</span> (the Roswell Park regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86658\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86658 \">table 3</a>)), the de Gramont regimen of short-term infusional FU and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65525 \">table 4</a>), and single agent capecitabine.

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy dosing for obese patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal number of chemotherapy courses is not established. Four months of systemic chemotherapy in conjunction with six weeks of chemoradiotherapy is reasonable, to provide approximately six months of perioperative therapy. (See <a href=\"#H521922\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal sequence of adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy has not been established conclusively. In a nonstudy setting, we typically administer two months of chemotherapy followed by six weeks of concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy and followed by two months of additional chemotherapy. However, an acceptable alternative is to start with four months of chemotherapy and finish-up with concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy.
