In a review of 229 unintentional firearm fatalities among children &lt;15 years in the United States during 2005 to 2012, 81 percent of the victims were male, and most deaths occurred in children age 11 to 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among children age two to four years, 27 of the 42 shooting deaths were self-inflicted; in all other age groups, the majority of shooting deaths were other-inflicted (usually by a brother, another family member, or friend).

In another survey, high school students who self-reported being a victim of traditional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cyberbullying were more likely to report access to loaded guns than students who were not bullied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of firearm-related deaths and injuries to children extends beyond the pain and suffering of the victims and their families. Children who shoot someone unintentionally are at risk for subsequent mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Firearm injuries put a burden on the health care and criminal justice systems and reduce the work force due to deaths and disabilities. In 2010, the total cost (ie, direct medical costs and lost productivity) of firearm-related assaults, homicides, suicides, and self-inflicted firearm injuries for children age &le;18 years in the United States was estimated to exceed 3.6 billion dollars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The hidden costs of firearm injuries are reflected in the fear and worry that permeate inner-city neighborhoods.

Because of the high potential for mortality in firearm injuries, pre-event strategies are preferred to event or post-event strategies.

Asking about access to guns (not just the presence of a firearm in the home) identifies patients at increased risk of firearm injury who may benefit from education and safety counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Although education and safety counseling have not been definitively proven to decrease firearm injury or death, they do not cause harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>].</p><p>Anticipatory guidance regarding guns is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American College of Physicians, the Society for Adolescent Medicine, and the American Pediatric Surgical Association, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/1,2,40-42,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,40-42,50</a>].

This is true even in the state of Florida. Although the 2011 Privacy of Firearms Owners Act restricted clinicians from asking patients and their families about firearms and intentionally entering firearm information into medical records, it included an exception for health care practitioners who, in good faith, believed that the information was relevant to the patient's medical care or safety or the safety of others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Most unintentional firearm deaths occur in or around the home. When young children are unintentionally injured or killed by a firearm, the injury is usually self-inflicted or inflicted by another child, typically a family member. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies to prevent firearm injuries in children can be categorized according to their time of implementation: pre-event, event, or post-event (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71200 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Framework for prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-event strategies, which focus on preventing children from shooting firearms, are preferred to event or post-event strategies. Pre-event strategies include family counseling about gun avoidance and safe handling and storage of firearms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112196 \">table 2</a>), gun safety features, and legislation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pre-event strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We encourage pediatric health care clinicians to provide anticipatory guidance about the dangers of firearms in the home. Parents who possess guns, particularly handguns, should be encouraged to remove them from the home or to store them safely (unloaded and locked, with ammunition stored securely in a separate location).
