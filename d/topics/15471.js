Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of the United States population, with as many as 25 to 40 percent of those with diabetes undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Worldwide, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is estimated at 6.4 percent in adults, varying from 3.8 to 10.2 percent by region; rates of undetected diabetes may be as high as 50 percent in some areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Type 2 diabetes accounts for over 90 percent of patients with diabetes. Because of the associated microvascular and macrovascular disease, diabetes accounts for almost 14 percent of United States health care expenditures, at least one-half of which are related to complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, end-stage renal disease, retinopathy, and foot ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Numerous other factors also contribute to the impact of diabetes on quality of life and economics. Diabetes is associated with a high prevalence of affective illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and adversely impacts employment, absenteeism, and work productivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the evidence and recommendations related to screening asymptomatic patients for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Screening pregnant women for gestational diabetes and the evaluation of patients with signs and symptoms of diabetes (polydipsia, polyuria, blurred vision, paresthesias, or unexplained weight loss) is discussed separately. Additionally, the prevention of type 2 diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is discussed separately.

However, because of its inconvenience, OGTT is not commonly used for screening, except in pregnant women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: Screening and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Screening methods'</a>.)</p><p>Glucose intolerance exists along a spectrum, and the definition of type 2 diabetes is usually defined by setting a threshold for one or more of the proposed screening tests along this continuum. The sensitivity and specificity of fasting plasma glucose and A1C as screening tests vary according to the population tested and the threshold used to define diabetes. Defining a reference standard for diabetes as a two-hour blood glucose &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> during an OGTT, the specificity of a fasting plasma glucose &ge;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> was greater than 95 percent and the sensitivity was approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Specificity and sensitivity may be lower for people over the age of 65. Using the same reference standard, the specificity and sensitivity of an A1C &ge;6.5 percent were reported as 79 and 44 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although the moderate specificity reported for A1C could be seen as a problem for a screening test, the presence of diabetic retinopathy correlated better with A1C &ge;6.5 percent than with fasting plasma glucose or OGTT criteria and might even support an argument that A1C is a better reference standard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood glucose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no specific cut-points, a variety of complications and an increased disease burden occur more commonly in patients whose blood glucose is at the higher end of the continuum. An Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus defined three categories (normal, increased risk for diabetes, and diabetes mellitus) based upon results of a fasting plasma glucose concentration, A1C, or two-hour OGTT (75 g glucose load) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19,20</a>] (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hemoglobin A1C'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Normal</strong> &ndash; Fasting plasma glucose &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.

However, it should be used with caution in certain populations.

The majority of available risk assessment tools involve simple questionnaires about important diabetes risk factors (eg, age, weight, family history of diabetes, personal history of hypertension, physical activity). A score is assigned for each risk factor, and the total score used to identify individuals for laboratory screening. Depending upon the cut-point used, sensitivity and specificity for predicting undiagnosed diabetes are approximately 80 and 70 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>].</p><p>Since risk factors may not simply be additive, ideally a risk score should be based on a calculator incorporating weighted factors according to regression analyses. One risk calculator, the FINRISK, incorporates factors of age, BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, activity, diet, family history, and history of glucose intolerance. In one study, this calculator performed the best of those models evaluated that incorporated only noninvasive measures (eg, did not include laboratory testing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The aROC (area under the ROC curve, plotting sensitivity of the test against its false-positive rate) for this model was 0.85, with an aROC of 0.5 indicating a random guess and an aROC of 1.0 representing perfect discrimination. This model is one of the two endorsed by the Canadian Medical Association to identify people to be screened.</p><p>More complex models using risk factor assessment combined with laboratory testing have been devised to predict the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. These models are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H9731194\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Prediction models'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179774795\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVENESS OF SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials have not demonstrated that screening for diabetes improves important health outcomes (eg, microvascular complications, cardiovascular disease, and mortality). This may be due to the length of follow-up in the trials. The long-term complications of diabetes would be expected to require more than a decade of diabetes to develop; thus, trials may not demonstrate improvements in morbidity or mortality associated with the complications of diabetes, as they may not have followed patients for enough time. Additional trials examining morbidity and quality-of-life issues between screen-detected diabetes and diagnosis through routine clinical care are needed.</p><p>A 2015 systematic review including two randomized trials evaluating screening for diabetes found no evidence that screening improved mortality after 10 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The largest randomized trial (n = 15,408 patients) evaluated screening for type 2 diabetes in patients at increased risk (based on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), family and smoking history, use of steroids and antihypertensives) in 33 general practices in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to three arms: screening followed by intensive multifactorial treatment (targeting glucose, blood pressure, and lipid control) for those diagnosed with diabetes; screening followed by routine care of diabetes; and a no-screening control group. No difference in overall mortality (10.50 and 9.89 deaths per 1000 person-years, respectively, hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.90-1.25) was found after a median follow-up of 9.6 years. There was also no difference in diabetes-related mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cancer mortality, or other causes of death. Data on long-term microvascular complications (eg, retinopathy, kidney disease) and coronary heart disease events were not reported. Limitations of this trial include a low overall prevalence of newly diagnosed diabetes (3 percent of screened population) and the lack of data on outcomes in patients with screen-detected diabetes compared with patients diagnosed through routine clinical care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15766284\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost-effectiveness models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cost-effectiveness analyses have suggested that diabetes screening in older adults is cost effective. As an example, in a computer simulation model, eight screening strategies were compared with a no-screening control strategy in a simulated population of 325,000 people aged 30 years without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The benefits of early detection for all screening strategies included a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction and microvascular complications and an increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 50 years of age. The most cost-effective strategies were those that started screening between the ages of 30 and 45 years, with screening repeated every three to five years. However, the reliability of these results is in question because the model assumed perfect performance and compliance with treatment recommendations and no adverse effects of treatment and, thus, may not be representative. Real-world implementation of an intensive lifestyle intervention, similar to that provided in the Diabetes Prevention Program trial, is challenging and requires ongoing counseling and support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Diabetes Prevention Program'</a>.)</p><p>In other cost-effectiveness analyses, screening targeted to individuals with hypertension was more cost effective than universal screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and screening for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; prediabetes) and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, followed by intervention (lifestyle or pharmacologic), was more cost effective than no screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In one model, the most cost-effective strategy was targeted screening at age 55 to 75 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. For example, the cost per QALY for targeted screening at age 55, compared with no screening, was estimated as USD $34,375.
