(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As heart disease progresses into HF, there is remodeling of the left ventricle (called cardiac or ventricular remodeling). Muscle mass increases, the left ventricle may enlarge, cardiac systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic function declines, and symptoms of HF become evident.</p><p>Cardiac remodeling is thought to be an important aspect of disease progression in HF, regardless of cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is manifested clinically by changes in cardiac size, shape, and function in response to aging, cardiac injury, or increased load (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69944 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac remodeling: Basic aspects&quot;, section on 'Basic concepts of cardiac remodeling'</a>.) The remodeling may be concentric or eccentric (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87847 \">figure 2</a>). In the concentric form, the left ventricular chamber does not enlarge and HF is categorized as HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In the eccentric form, the ventricle undergoes progressive dilation and the clinical condition is identified as HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The demographics of these two forms of HF, their prognosis, and their management differ. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of heart failure&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The importance of remodeling as a pathogenic mechanism is incompletely understood, since the factors leading to remodeling could be the major determinants of HF prognosis rather than ventricular dilation itself. Consistent with the hypothesis that remodeling is pathogenically important in HF is the observation that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, and the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> and nitrates, which improve survival in patients with HFrEF, can slow and in some cases reverse, certain parameters of cardiac remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/3-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11</a>]. In contrast, such therapies have not been effective in improving prognosis or ventricular structure in HFpEF.

The basic aspects of cardiac remodeling, such as the mechanisms involved, the factors influencing remodeling, its role in HF progression, and measurement of remodeling, are discussed separately.

The frequency with which remodeling occurs in this setting was assessed in the GISSI-3 Echo Substudy in which serial echocardiograms were performed in 614 patients with an average infarct size that was relatively small (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Using the end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) as a marker of remodeling, the following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 24 to 48 hours after symptom onset to hospital discharge, the EDVI fell in 26 percent, was stable in 23 percent, increased modestly in 32 percent, and increased more than 20 percent in 19 percent (severe early remodeling).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between hospital discharge and six months after infarction, the EDVI fell in 31 percent, was stable in 25 percent, increased modestly in 28 percent, and increased more than 20 percent in 16 percent (severe late remodeling).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In-hospital left ventricular enlargement was not predictive of subsequent remodeling, but late remodeling, which most often occurred in the absence of in-hospital left ventricular enlargement, was associated with a progressive deterioration of global left ventricular function and more extensive wall motion abnormalities.</p><p/><p>Determinants of infarct expansion and ventricular remodeling and dilation include large infarct size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], Q-wave MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], anterior location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], lack of patency of the infarct vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>], elevated intraventricular pressure, and lack of use of thrombolytic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Data from the GISSI-3 trial suggest that serial electrocardiographic changes, particular involving negative T waves, can predict postinfarction remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Lack of negative T wave resolution or the late appearance of new negative T waves were associated with less recovery of wall motion abnormalities, more pronounced left ventricular enlargement, and progressive deterioration of ventricular function; in contrast, normalization of negative T waves was related to functional recovery of viable myocardium and was more useful than QRS changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurements of the extent of left ventricular (LV) remodeling have prognostic value; the greater the extent of the eccentric remodeling, the poorer the prognosis. Among patients with coronary heart disease, a recent myocardial infarction, or HF, relatively small increases in ventricular volume are associated with major increases in the risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Measures of remodeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures that assess the extent of LV remodeling include LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions and volumes, shape, mass, ejection fraction (LVEF), and myocardial strain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69944 \">figure 1</a>). Each measure is indicative of a different aspect of the disease state and none can currently be considered as definitive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular mass and shape</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging methods such as echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, and computed tomography provide a means for measuring LV mass and evaluating ventricular shape.</p><p>Although electrocardiography is commonly used clinically to diagnose LV hypertrophy, the sensitivity of the various electrocardiogram (ECG) criteria for LV hypertrophy may be as low as 7 to 35 percent with mild disease and 10 to 50 percent with moderate to severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, echocardiography is preferred over ECG for detection of LV hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical implications and treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Measurements of ventricular hypertrophy (by echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography) expressed as LV mass provide some indication of overall ventricular structure. However, global measures of hypertrophy do not provide information on specific structural abnormalities, the degree of myocyte slippage, or the relative contributions of myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis. The distribution of hypertrophy may be assessed by more detailed segmental evaluation of LV mass <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wall thickness. Myocardial <span class=\"nowrap\">scarring/fibrosis</span> may be identified by contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance or computed tomography methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Left ventricular volume and systolic function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, LVEF, ventricular linear dimensions, and fractional shortening have all been measured in clinical studies of remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/3,4,18,21,24,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,18,21,24,30</a>] and have identified the extent of remodeling in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LV end-diastolic volume is a reflection of both structural remodeling and diastolic filling (end-diastolic myocyte fiber length).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LV end-systolic volume is influenced by both the LV end-diastolic volume and fiber shortening; however, asymmetric contraction may make measures of LV end-systolic volume derived from M-mode or two-dimensional echocardiography estimates inaccurate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LVEF is derived from LV volume. Although heart rate and fiber shortening both affect LVEF, it is influenced to a far greater extent by LV end-diastolic volume because changes in stroke volume tend to be much smaller than changes in LV end-diastolic volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractional shortening is an echocardiographic measure of ventricular contractile function. However, since fractional shortening is derived from a single linear measure of LV cavity at end-diastole and end-systole it may not provide a representative estimate of function, particularly when systolic impairment is regional.</p><p/><p>The importance of these factors is variable. As an example, a reduced LVEF is associated with a poor prognosis in heart failure (HF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54758\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54758 \">figure 3</a>). In an analysis from the SOLVD trials and registry, a one standard deviation reduction in LVEF increased all-cause mortality (risk ratio 1.62) and cardiovascular hospitalization (risk ratio 1.59) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, relying on a univariate predictor such as the LVEF to estimate survival is not very accurate in the individual patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictors of survival in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients who have had a myocardial infarction, LV volumes, particularly LV end-systolic volume, are important prognostic indicators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Such patients who have subsequent morbid events have greater increases in LV diastolic and systolic volumes, as determined by echocardiography, than those without such events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, the in-hospital LVEF and the extent of wall motion abnormalities after the infarct are among the significant predictors of progressive LV dilatation and chronic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/17,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30</a>]. On the other hand, in-hospital LV enlargement is usually not predictive of subsequent remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/17,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-stratification-after-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk stratification after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>LV systolic dysfunction is difficult to identify solely on the basis of signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. As an example, one epidemiologic study evaluated 1467 men and women who underwent echocardiography; LV systolic dysfunction, defined as an LVEF &le;30 percent, was present in 2.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of those with LV dysfunction were asymptomatic, ie, remodeling had occurred before the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. On the other hand, there is clear benefit from treating patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction (mostly following myocardial infarction) with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75136 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>]. Since symptoms alone are not a good indicator of the state of LV function, identification of patients with LV dysfunction will require screening of a high-risk population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>].</p><p>In HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), LV dysfunction is present with a normal end-diastolic LV volume. Diastolic dysfunction is generally present and may be accompanied by modest systolic dysfunction. Efforts to slow remodeling have not been successful in relieving symptoms or improving prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of imaging technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both radionuclide imaging and echocardiography provide a simple assessment of LV systolic function and chamber size&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, the application of these diagnostic tools in evaluation and management of remodeling needs to be further refined. Although the LVEF is of prognostic importance, opinions differ regarding the value of the LVEF in guiding therapy and there are no data that definitely support the use of changes in LVEF as a basis for altering therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictors of survival in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests to evaluate left ventricular systolic function&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Although echocardiography is reliable in clinical trials, repeat measurements of LV mass and volume or LVEF in individual patients may vary considerably and methods are poorly standardized between centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Further limiting its use is the inability to obtain adequate images in some patients, such as those who are obese or have airway disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Thus, one must be cautious in using standard echocardiographic monitoring to guide management. Echocardiography using harmonic imaging and contrast injection improves the accuracy and reproducibility of echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides better accuracy and reproducibility than echocardiography. However, it is less available and more expensive than echocardiography, which limits routine use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of LVEF to guide management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The LVEF, regardless of how it is measured, is an important predictor of outcome in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). As an example, the V-HeFT I and V-HeFT II trials identified LVEF, as determined by radionuclide imaging, as a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with HF. The mortality increased in a nonlinear fashion as LVEF fell, with the mortality rate increasing steeply in patients with an LVEF below 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>However, using LVEF to estimate survival in an individual patient is of limited value. Large trials have demonstrated that patients with New York Heart Association class II or III HF have a worse prognosis than those who are asymptomatic. Despite the difference in outcome, the difference in mean LVEF between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in these trials was small: 28 to 31 percent in asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>] versus 25 percent in patients with moderate symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Another problem is that the LVEF is of limited utility in some situations, as in the immediate post-infarction period where LV dysfunction may be caused by large areas of hibernating or stunned myocardium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite these limitations, information about the LVEF, generated from echocardiography, often results in decisions about management. This was illustrated in a report of 259 patients with suspected or untreated HF who were referred for echocardiography by general practitioners; the findings resulted in a change in management in more than two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Increases in LVEF have been linked to improved prognosis in HFrEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. Although the degree of improvement is important, it must be considered in the context of other responses that may affect mortality. An analysis of the combined data from V-HeFT I and II showed that, although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> did not increase LVEF as much as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-dinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosorbide dinitrate</a>,</span> it was associated with a greater reduction in mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64938 \">figure 5</a>); these observations suggest that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system conferred additional survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/43,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,47</a>].</p><p>The V-HeFT data also found that serial measurements of LVEF provided additional prognostic information, suggesting that there is some merit to monitoring LVEF or chamber size to assess response to therapy and altering it accordingly. However, randomized clinical trials have yet to prospectively test this hypothesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac troponin I and T, which are released during myocyte injury, are elevated in some patients with HF, even in the absence of coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. Such enzyme elevations are associated with progressive decline in LV function and more frequent cardiac events, suggesting that they are markers of ongoing myocardial damage. High sensitivity assays of troponin provide more precision in detecting an enzyme leak indicative of cell damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surrogate markers, such as LVEF, ventricular volumes, and fractional shortening, provide a general guide to the extent of cardiac remodeling and are useful clinical predictors of outcome. However, they do not provide a clear picture of changes in the underlying pathophysiology of the heart. New developments that may be useful to assess the extent of LV remodeling include imaging techniques for the quantitative evaluation of myocardial and nonmyocardial components and the measurement of neurohormones known to be elevated in HF (such as brain natriuretic peptide) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. The latter approach, perhaps combined with echocardiography, offers the possibility of more reliable detection of asymptomatic LV dysfunction. There is also evidence that plasma brain natriuretic peptide can be used to monitor the effect of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, slowing or reversing remodeling was not a recognized goal of therapy. The most convincing data demonstrating that chronic medical therapy (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and beta blockers) can modify the remodeling process are based upon changes in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/3-5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,8,9</a>]. These agents have a beneficial effect on remodeling in addition to other clinically relevant benefits that result in a reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) as well as asymptomatic LV dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75136 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>].
