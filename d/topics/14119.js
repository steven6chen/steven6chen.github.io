Since then, an estimated seven million pregnancies have been achieved worldwide by IVF and its modifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These procedures are known generically as assisted reproductive technology (ART) and include gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), and zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT). In the United States, approximately 1.5 percent of all births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and 20 percent of all multiple births are the result of IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; the rate is higher when all types of medically-assisted conception are considered. </p><p>As experience has accumulated, ART success rates have increased and the indications for these procedures have expanded. Concerns about the outcome of these pregnancies have accompanied their increasing prevalence. Both short and long-term outcomes have been studied and the findings are generally reassuring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, research in this field is complicated by the need to distinguish between the effects of ART on outcomes in offspring versus multiple other confounding or mediating factors. Furthermore, these outcomes are influenced by technological changes in the performance of ART, as well as changes in obstetrical and neonatal care, over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The outcome of pregnancies conceived by ART will be discussed here.

Most of these are related to the high incidence of multiple gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Whereas multiple gestations achieved by IVF appear to have similar outcomes to those of multiple gestations conceived spontaneously, singleton pregnancies after IVF are associated with an increased incidence of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The precise reasons for this increase in adverse outcomes are not clear, but potential candidates include: maternal and paternal characteristics, underlying medical conditions associated with subfertility and infertility, sperm factors, the use of fertility medications, laboratory conditions during embryo culture, culture medium, cryopreservation and thawing, prenatal genetic diagnosis (if performed), differences in obstetrical management, increased proportion of multiple gestations and vanishing twins, or a combination of these factors. The effects of advanced maternal age also need to be considered since many women who undergo IVF are older and older women are more likely to have pregnancy complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Potential adverse outcomes in singleton IVF pregnancies are discussed in detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Early loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early spontaneous pregnancy loss is common in pregnancies conceived naturally and with ART, and the rate of loss is similar for both methods of conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In studies of serial ultrasound examination from initial diagnosis of very early pregnancies conceived by IVF, spontaneous loss of at least one gestation occurred in about 25 percent of singleton pregnancies, 35 percent of twin pregnancies, and 55 percent of triplet pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The rate of second trimester loss does not appear to be impacted by ART.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that the slightly increased risk of adverse outcomes in singleton gestations conceived with ART (see below) is due to the high proportion of singletons that result from vanishing twins or triplets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/9,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13-16</a>]. In the SART database of 21,535 singleton deliveries conceived by ART, 8 percent originated from a twin or triplet gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Compared to pregnancies with one fetal heartbeat on early ultrasound examination, early loss of a sonographically identified second or third fetal heartbeat significantly increased the odds of preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW) for gestational age, and the risk increased in proportion to the number of fetal heartbeats lost. Using the same SART database, the authors reported similar findings for twin deliveries that experienced early loss of a third fetal heartbeat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>However, studies have not consistently observed an adverse effect from early spontaneous loss of one twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Furthermore, numerous other factors related to subfertility or the IVF procedure could be contributing to the small increase in adverse outcomes described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Spontaneous abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spontaneous abortion rate is approximately 16 percent of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As is the case with pregnancy rates, spontaneous abortion rates are strongly influenced by the age of the egg provider, with lesser effects from the underlying cause of infertility. Studies have shown that spontaneous abortion rate after ART (IVF with or without ICSI) is the same as for the general population of the United States when fresh fertilized embryos are used and adjustments are made for age and multiple gestation, but the rate may be somewhat higher with thawed embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Ectopic pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 0.7 percent of cycles result in an ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Ectopic risk among ART pregnancies varies according to the type of procedure (eg, higher with zygote intrafallopian transfer or ZIFT) and reproductive health characteristics of the woman carrying the pregnancy (eg, higher in those with tubal factor infertility) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As an example, in this study, standard IVF and transcervical embryo transfer resulted in 2.2 percent rate of ectopic pregnancy, whereas embryo transfer to a gestational surrogate was associated with only a 0.9 percent risk of ectopic pregnancy, a rate similar to that in spontaneous pregnancies.</p><p>Heterotopic pregnancy is far more common in pregnancies conceived by ART than spontaneous conceptions <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/100</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">1/30,000)</span>. This increase mirrors the dramatic increase in multiple gestations after IVF due to the transfer of multiple embryos. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites#H2058583490\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Epidemiology, risk factors, and anatomic sites&quot;, section on 'Heterotopic pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Proportion of singleton and multiple gestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased implantation rates have resulted in increased overall ART birth rates as well as increased multiple gestation rates. The rates of singleton and multiple births following ART vary around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/3,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23,24</a>]. The 2014 United States (US) singleton birth rate was 60 percent of all ART births, compared with a nearly 80 percent singleton rate reported by 16 European countries in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>In the US in 2014, nearly 40 percent of ART infants were part of a multiple birth compared with 3.5 percent of naturally conceived infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, the multiple birth rate varied greatly by state (range 19 percent in Delaware to 56 percent in Idaho). The rates of singleton, twin, and triplets-or-higher pregnancies were 56.4, 41.2, and 2.4 percent, respectively. While the overall rates of multiple births are higher for ART births than natural births, the percent of multiple births from ART has been declining since 2009 because fewer embryos are being transferred per cycle and centers are increasing the use of elective single embryo transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Strategies to reduce the risks of multiple gestation and multifetal pregnancy reduction are discussed separately.

In one large series, the frequency of monochorionic-diamniotic implantations was increased, but the frequency of monochorionic-monoamniotic implantations was not; dichorionic-diamniotic implantations were not assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The increase in monozygotic twinning has been attributed to the in vitro culture environment and to extended duration of culture (ie, day 5-6 embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]). It is unclear whether embryo manipulation, such as ICSI or assisted hatching, contributes to the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Preterm birth, LBW, and SGA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Singleton IVF pregnancies, with or without ICSI, are at higher risk of preterm birth and LBW (&le;2500 g) compared to spontaneously conceived pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/9,29-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29-40</a>]. </p><p>Two large studies by the same group, whose findings are similar to those generally reported in the literature, illustrate these risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first, population-based data from over 42,000 infants conceived with ART from 1996 to 1997 and 3 million births in the general population showed the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]: LBW was significantly more common among term singleton, but not twin, infants conceived by ART compared with the general population (for singletons 6.5 versus 2.5 percent; RR 2.6, 95% CI 2.4-2.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Preterm LBW was also significantly more common among singleton, but not twin, infants conceived by ART (for singletons 6.6 versus 4.7 percent; RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.5).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The increased risk persisted after adjustment for maternal age and parity, gestational age at delivery, multifetal reduction procedures, and cause of infertility. The lack of a strong association between IVF and preterm birth in twins in this and subsequent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/33,34,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,41,42</a>] may be due to confounding factors, such as the much higher proportion of monozygotic twins (which are at increased risk of preterm birth and LBW) among spontaneously conceived twin gestations than among IVF twin gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. It is possible that the profound effect that twinning has on pregnancy outcome overshadows any additional effect that IVF may exert. These data may also be interpreted as supporting the contention that an increase in adverse outcomes among singletons is due to the &quot;vanishing twin&quot; phenomenon described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An extended follow-up study included over 62,000 singleton infants from ART procedures from 1996 to 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Over this interval, there was a decline in LBW deliveries, but no significant change in the rate of preterm birth. Although the frequency of LBW declined, it was still higher than the expected rate adjusted for age, parity, and <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span>. Clear reasons for the fall in LBW and the persistent increased risk of preterm birth were not identified.</p><p/><p>It appears that frozen embryo transfers (FETs) are associated with a decrease in SGA and LBW births, as well as with preterm births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. This suggests that the more natural endometrial preparation prior to FET plays a role in these parameters, possibly by allowing for more natural placentation than that which occurs in stimulated cycles. In one of the studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], incidence of SGA, LBW, and preterm births was nevertheless higher in FET singletons than in naturally conceived singletons. </p><p>In addition, meta-analyses comprising several thousand IVF and approximately two million spontaneously conceived singleton births matched for maternal age and parity found IVF pregnancies were at significantly higher risk of preterm delivery (OR 1.95-1.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/32,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,35</a>], LBW (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.40-2.22), and small for gestational age (SGA) infants (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.3-2.0) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53754 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The increased risk of preterm delivery remained when only preterm births after spontaneous labor were considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

There are several potential explanations for the difference in outcome between ART and naturally conceived pregnancies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It could be related to the ART procedure (drugs, manipulation of gametes and embryos, culture, effect of ovarian stimulation on endometrial receptivity), although a physiological mechanism explaining how the procedures and drugs used in ART increase the risk of LBW has not been determined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are probably treatment biases in studies of IVF pregnancies, as these pregnancies can be associated with excessive parental anxiety (&quot;premium pregnancy&quot;) and are more common in couples of higher socioeconomic status. As a result, they are likely to undergo more intense monitoring and more frequent intervention, such as a higher rate of elective cesarean delivery (11.4 versus 6.7 percent in spontaneously conceived singletons). However, very LBW (&lt;1500 g) is unlikely to be the result of elective preterm delivery, and this outcome is also more common among singletons conceived through ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/9,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subfertility appears to have an adverse effect on pregnancy outcome, independent of its treatment. Several studies have reported that women with untreated subfertility who became pregnant had a greater frequency of adverse outcomes than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/39,49-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,49-53</a>], and their frequency of complications was similar to that in subfertile women who underwent ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. All of the studies were observational and many potential confounders were not considered in the analyses.</p><p/><p>More compelling support for this latter hypothesis comes from two population-based cohort studies. The first compared the pregnancy outcome of multiparous women who underwent ART with the pregnancy outcome of (1) the same women in a previous or subsequent naturally conceived pregnancy, and (2) the general obstetrical population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Multiparous women who underwent ART had infants of similar gestational age and birth weight in pregnancies before and after the procedure, but their infants delivered earlier and had lower birth weights than the general obstetrical population. A similar population-based cohort study that also compared siblings conceived either spontaneously or through IVF reported that the maternal characteristic of subfertility was associated with lower birth weight, but the IVF procedure itself was not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurodevelopmental issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurodevelopmental outcomes include psychomotor, cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional development, as well as mental disorders (eg, mental retardation, autism, attention <span class=\"nowrap\">deficit/hyperactivity</span> disorder). The bulk of available evidence suggests that the neurodevelopmental outcomes of singleton children conceived after medically assisted reproduction are similar to those of children conceived naturally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. As an example, a 2013 systematic review that analyzed data from 80 studies comparing the neurodevelopmental outcome of children born after ART and controls conceived naturally; the studies included between 31 and 2,446,044 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Lastly, a survey study of over 5000 children conceived naturally or with assisted reproductive technology who were followed for a mean of 19 years reported no differences between the groups in school difficulties in childhood, impaired school performance in adolescence, or intelligence in young adulthood by conception type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p>The impact of infertility itself on neurodevelopment is not known. In a study that assessed early intervention program enrollment by type of pregnancy, singleton children conceived through ART and children of subfertile mothers both had elevated risks of early intervention enrollment compared with singleton children born to mothers with normal fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This finding could also be the result of increased vigilance on the part of parents of children born after subfertility and point to a potential diagnosis bias.</p><p>In addition to the small number of children followed to school age and beyond, these studies are limited by methodological issues such as possible selection biases, inadequate control groups, and potentially confounding preexisting parental factors. For example, the etiology of subfertility, parental medical conditions, and socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics of couples who undertake ART could account for the differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes between their children and those conceived naturally reported in some studies, and these characteristics may also mask some true differences between the two groups. Large, well-controlled studies with long-term follow-up based on blinded and validated assessments are needed.</p><p>Although ART does not appear to be an independent risk factor for adverse neurodevelopment or growth outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>], the procedure does result in more multiple gestations, which are at high risk of preterm birth, LBW, and SGA infants, three important risk factors for neurodevelopmental sequelae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H803067108\"><span class=\"h2\">Pubertal development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been a single report of seven children (six girls and one boy) age 5 to 21 months referred to a pediatric endocrine department because of premature thelarche and pubarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Subfertile men (and women) are more likely than fertile individuals to have chromosomal abnormalities (eg, aneuploidies, structural abnormalities, gene mutations, microdeletions) that may contribute to their subfertility and may be passed to their offspring.

At least 70 genes in which active transcription is normally limited to only one allele have been identified. These genes involve early embryonic growth, placental development and neurodevelopment. Generally, specific imprinted genes promoting fetal development are often active from only the maternal allele, while other imprinted genes promoting placental growth are active from only the paternal allele.</p><p>Abnormalities of the imprinting process can be caused by several molecular mechanisms, including DNA mutations of an imprinted gene, <span class=\"nowrap\">deletion/duplication</span> of regions of the chromosome containing the imprinted gene, uniparental disomy, and changes in DNA methylation.</p><p>Concerns have been raised that ART may affect imprinted genes. The basis for this concern is that imprints are established during meiosis, typically with alterations of methylation at the specific allele that render it silent. In the female, meiosis I occurs at ovulation and meiosis II is completed at fertilization, thus, both meiosis I and II occur during events that may be vulnerable to processes and manipulations related to ART. Imprinting syndromes are rare (fewer than 1 in 12,000 births), thus even a several-fold increase in relative risk represents a small absolute risk and would be difficult to detect.</p><p>There are nine known imprinting syndromes. Given the rarity of these disorders, it is difficult to determine whether they may be related to some aspect of the ART procedure or subfertility itself or a combination of factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-outcome-after-assisted-reproductive-technology/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

Only two small studies in the meta-analysis used an untreated subfertile group of women as a control group and neither reported a statistically significant association between fertility treatment and cancer in offspring; however, the findings are inconclusive given the small number of cases in these two studies. </p><p>The low absolute risk of cancer after fertility therapy should also be considered.
