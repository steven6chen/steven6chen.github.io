The manifestations of CSD, however, can include visceral organ, neurologic, and ocular involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The microbiology, epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of CSD will be reviewed here. The treatment of CSD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-cat-scratch-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of cat scratch disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although clinical descriptions of cat scratch disease (CSD) existed for more than 50 years, the first convincing evidence of an infectious cause of CSD came in 1983 when investigators at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, using a Warthin-Starry stain, demonstrated small, pleomorphic organisms in the lymph nodes of 29 of 34 patients with CSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p><em>Afipia felis</em> first was believed to be the cause of CSD after investigators isolated this organism from patients with CSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, current serologic and culture data provide convincing evidence that <em>Bartonella henselae</em> is the etiologic agent in most cases of CSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In humans and cats, two main <em>B. henselae</em> genotypic groups have been identified based on molecular analysis: the Houston-1 serotype and Marseille serotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One report also described a case of CSD caused by <em>Bartonella clarridgeiae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, scattered, uncommon cases of CSD may result from <em>A. felis</em>, <em>B. clarridgeiae</em>, and perhaps other, as yet unidentified, fastidious organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Among HIV-infected persons (and less commonly other immunocompromised individuals), <em>B. henselae</em> can cause bacillary angiomatosis (BA), peliosis hepatis, and splenitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Bartonella infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>). Rare reports have also documented BA among immunocompetent individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of cat scratch disease (CSD) remains poorly understood. Disease manifestations result from either local infection, such as lymphadenopathy, or from bloodborne disseminated infection, such as occurs with neuroretinitis or visceral organ involvement. Cats serve as the natural reservoir for <em>B. henselae</em> and the organism causes intraerythrocytic bacteremia that can persist for a year or longer in some cats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Following inoculation of <em>B. henselae</em> into humans, the organism typically causes a local infection that manifests as regional lymphadenopathy. Within the human host, <em>B. henselae</em> invades endothelial cells causing an acute inflammatory reaction associated with activation of a proinflammatory cascade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It remains unknown why some patients have infection that remains localized whereas others develop disseminated disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cat scratch disease (CSD) generally occurs in immunocompetent individuals and infrequently causes serious illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although most commonly a disease of children and young adults, a surveillance study conducted in Israel found that 52 of 846 (6 percent) immunocompetent patients with CSD were &ge;60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Systemic CSD has been described in patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>] and in a patient being treated with pegylated interferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> for hepatitis C virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>Epidemiologic studies from the United States, Europe, Israel, Australia, and Japan, suggest that CSD has a worldwide distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a study from Germany, CSD was identified in 61 of 454 patients (13 percent) with primary head and neck masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In the United States, a retrospective study of patients younger than 65 years of age identified 13,273 patients with a diagnosis of CSD from 2005 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Approximately 12,000 cases of CSD were diagnosed annually in the outpatient setting and 500 persons with CSD were hospitalized each year. The cases had a seasonal distribution with a peak in January and late summer and fall. In this analysis, the incidence of CSD was highest among those who lived in the southeastern United States (6.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/100,000</span> population) and in children aged 5 to 9 (9.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/100,000</span> population). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available data suggest that cat scratch disease (CSD) can result from a scratch or bite from an infected cat, as well as from exposure to cat fleas. It can also be spread via contact with cat saliva through broken skin or mucosal surfaces (eg, mouth and eyes). Although cats are the main reservoir for <em>B. henselae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], rare cases of CSD have occurred after exposure to dogs, presumably resulting from flea bites. CSD may rarely occur in family clusters with more than one child in the family presenting simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Multiple lines of evidence have directly linked CSD to exposure to cats, especially young cats and cats with fleas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/1,7,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,26</a>]. The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, plays a critical role in the horizontal cat-to-cat transmission of <em>B. henselae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In one study of 205 cats in northern California, <em>B. henselae</em> bacteremia was documented in 56 and 34 percent of cats less than one year and at least one year of age, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Moreover, 90 and 77 percent of cats less than one and one year or older, respectively, had positive <em>B. henselae</em> serology. Most cats infected with <em>B. henselae</em> do not show clinical signs of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Fleas have also been implicated in the transmission of CSD. In one study of 60 CSD patients and 56 age-matched controls, exposure to kittens (odds ratio [OR] 15), a scratch or bite by a kitten (OR 27), and having a kitten with fleas (OR 29) were more common among cases than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a study of <em>B. henselae</em> antibodies in catteries, flea infestation was the risk factor most associated with high seroprevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Topical treatments that prevent flea infestations may have a role in preventing transmission of <em>B. henselae</em> from fleas to cats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. As an example, one study evaluated the use of topical selamectin (a commercially available parasiticide) to prevent transmission of <em>B. henselae </em>in 12 cats who were exposed to <em>B. henselae</em>-positive fleas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Six of the cats were treated with topical 6% selamectin three days prior to and one day after being exposed to the fleas, and six cats received no treatment. None of the treated cats developed <em>B. henselae</em> infection; however, all of the untreated cats developed <em>B. henselae</em> bacteremia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cat scratch disease (CSD) presents in 85 to 90 percent of children as a localized cutaneous and lymph node disorder near the site of organism inoculation. However, in some individuals, the organisms disseminate and infect the liver, spleen, eye, or central nervous system. Patients with localized disease generally have a self-limited illness, whereas those with disseminated disease can have life-threatening complications.</p><p>Elderly patients with CSD are more likely to present with atypical features. In the surveillance study in Israel mentioned above, clinical data for patients with CSD aged &ge;60 years (elderly group) were compared with patients with CSD aged &lt;60 years (nonelderly group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Lymphadenitis, the hallmark of typical CSD, was less common in the elderly group compared with those &lt;60 years of age (77 versus 94 percent). By contrast, the elderly group was more likely to have general malaise (71 versus 51 percent), and atypical manifestation (33 versus 14 percent), including endocarditis (odds ratio [OR] 61.6, 95% CI 12.4-305.1), encephalitis (OR 6.3, 95% CI 1.2-33.3), and fever of unknown origin (OR 7.3, 95% CI 2.2-24.5). For these reasons, the time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of CSD in elderly persons was more commonly delayed by &gt;6 weeks (30 versus 13 percent in the nonelderly). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSD typically begins with a cutaneous lesion at the site of inoculation, the so-called primary inoculation lesion. This lesion usually develops three to ten days after the introduction of the organism into the skin and generally evolves through vesicular, erythematous, and papular phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78770\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78770 \">picture 1</a>). Less commonly the primary inoculation lesion can be pustular or nodular. One report described a patient who developed a paronychia (painful periungual inflammation) caused by <em>B. henselae</em> as a manifestation of an inoculation site lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The primary inoculation lesion typically persists for one to three weeks (range several days to several months).</p><p>Careful examination of the interdigital spaces, skin creases, and scalp increases the chance of finding the primary inoculation lesion. Inoculation sites other than the skin occur in about five to ten percent of cases and include the eye (nonsuppurative conjunctivitis, ocular granuloma) and mucous membranes (oral ulcer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The inoculation lesions usually cause minimal symptoms and heal without scarring.</p><p>Other uncommon cutaneous manifestations of CSD include a transient macular and papular eruption, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, and thrombocytopenic purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional lymphadenopathy is the hallmark of CSD. Enlarged lymph nodes appear proximal to the inoculation site, about two weeks (range, 7 to 60 days) after the organism is inoculated into the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52407\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52407 \">picture 2</a>). The location of the lymphadenopathy depends on the site of the inoculation; the most common locations are the axillary, epitrochlear, cervical, supraclavicular, and submandibular lymph nodes. </p><p>The nodes are almost always tender, often have erythema of the overlying skin, and occasionally suppurate (10 to 15 percent). Node size typically ranges from 1 to 5 cm, but may enlarge to 8 to 10 cm. Lymphadenopathy associated with CSD usually resolves in one to four months, but reports have described persistence of enlarged nodes for one to three years. </p><p>In one study, solitary lymphadenopathy occurred in approximately 85 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Less commonly, patients presented with several enlarged nodes in the same anatomic region. In another study, regional adenopathy (single or multiple nodes) occurred in approximately two-thirds of cases, with the remaining one-third of patients having enlarged nodes in several anatomic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Generalized lymphadenopathy is rare. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Visceral organ involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visceral organ involvement is an unusual, but important, manifestation of CSD in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]; visceral organ CSD can involve the liver, spleen, or both. Patients may have persistent fever of unknown origin (FUO), abdominal pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. About half of children with visceral organ involvement have hepatomegaly or splenomegaly evident on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]; the liver may be tender to palpation. Many of the patients with visceral involvement have no accompanying peripheral adenopathy. In one review, 100 of 832 patients (12 percent) with CSD had splenomegaly, but these were not patients in whom granulomatous splenitis was documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>An abdominal CT scan will typically show scattered, multiple defects in the liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spleen that if biopsied, would show necrotizing granulomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56489\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56489 \">image 1</a>). Biopsies are now rarely performed because the clinical and imaging findings are so characteristic. These are manifested as hypoechoic areas on ultrasound.</p><p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) is typically elevated and liver function tests may be mildly abnormal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever of unknown origin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. henselae</em> infection should be considered in the initial evaluation of fever of unknown origin and prolonged fever in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. A prospective analysis of 146 children with fever of unknown origin and prolonged fever found that <em>B. henselae</em> was the third most common infectious disease diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Although some of these patients presented with signs and symptoms consistent with typical CSD or hepatosplenic involvement, three of seven patients with confirmed <em>B. henselae</em> infection presented with fever of unknown origin and no clinical or radiographic manifestations of typical or hepatosplenic CSD.

Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome is characterized by tender regional lymphadenopathy of the preauricular, submandibular, or cervical lymph nodes associated with infection of the conjunctiva, eyelid, or adjacent skin surface. Usual complaints include unilateral red eye, foreign body sensation, and excessive watering of the eyes. Discharge may be serous or purulent and copious in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The inoculation of the organism occurs via a cat bite or lick near (or in) the eye, as well as by self-inoculation from another site. </p><p>Serious ocular, orbital, or retinal complications almost never develop as a result of local extension of Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome. One report described isolation of <em>B. henselae</em> from a conjunctival scraping in a patient with Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuroretinitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among all patients with CSD, about 1 to 2 percent develop neuroretinitis.

Although one study found that a higher proportion of patients with presumed CSD had an indirect IFA <em>B. henselae</em> IgG titer of &ge;1:64 compared with healthy controls (88 versus 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], four subsequent studies from Europe reported problems with <em>B. henselae</em> IFA tests including poor sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>] and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. </p><p>The reported problems with the <em>B. henselae</em> IFA serology tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant cross-reactivity at the species level between <em>B. henselae</em> and <em>Bartonella quintana</em>, especially for IgG assays.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitivity of the test does not appear to be optimal, especially with IgG assays.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevalence of positive <em>Bartonella</em> serology in the general population is 4 to 6 percent, which creates false positive tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3877870376\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. henselae</em> is a fastidious, slow-growing, gram-negative bacterium that requires specific laboratory conditions for optimal growth. It is important to proactively communicate with the microbiology laboratory; by informing them that <em>Bartonella</em> is a potential diagnosis, the laboratory can optimize culture techniques and can extend the incubation period for a minimum of 21 days. As an example, blood culture samples should be collected in pediatric or adult isolator tubes (Wampole, Cranbury, NJ) or in blood tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to increase the probability of isolating <em>B. henselae</em>. </p><p>Plating samples onto either chocolate agar or heart infusion agar supplemented with five percent rabbit blood enhances isolation of organisms from subcultures. Optimally, the microbiology lab should use fresh agar plates and incubate them in 5 percent CO<sub>2</sub> at 35 to 37&ordm;C for a minimum of 21 days.

Histiocytes and epithelioid cells surround the areas of necrosis in multiple layers, with the innermost layer often showing a palisading arrangement. A zone of lymphocytes surrounds the histiocytes; multinucleated giant cells are variably present. Although these findings support a diagnosis of CSD, they should not be considered definitive.</p><p>The histopathologic findings in involved lymph nodes are nonspecific and depend upon the stage of the disease. Lymphoid hyperplasia is present initially, followed by the development of stellate granulomas.

As an example, one study found that PCR testing is more likely to be positive if it is performed during the first six weeks of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In this study of 61 patients with CSD (defined as a compatible clinical presentation and serologic evidence of <em>B. henselae</em> infection), PCR was positive in only 10 of the 212 lymph node specimens on which this test was performed; 9 of the 10 patients with a positive result had a duration of illness of less than six weeks.</p><p>PCR testing of blood is available; however, it should not be used for routine evaluation of patients with suspected CDS.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple lines of evidence have directly linked CSD to exposure to cats, especially young cats and cats with fleas. CSD can result from a cat scratch or bite, as well as from a flea bite. It can also be spread via contact with cat saliva through broken skin or mucosal surfaces (eg, mouth and eyes). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most children (85 to 90 percent), CSD presents as a localized cutaneous and lymph node disorder near the site of organism inoculation. However, in some individuals, the organisms disseminate and infect the liver, spleen, eye, bone, or central nervous system. Patients with localized disease generally have a self-limited illness, whereas those with disseminated disease can have life-threatening complications. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CSD, a probable diagnosis is based upon a combination of clinical findings and a reported exposure to cats or fleas. In such patients, the diagnosis is most often confirmed with a positive serologic test for <em>B. henselae</em>. However, a negative serologic test should not rule out the diagnosis, and it is reasonable to initiate empiric therapy based upon a presumptive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3621862038\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2360544155\" class=\"local\">'Serology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lymph node or tissue biopsy is not routinely required for most patients who present with characteristic signs and symptoms, although it may be warranted in certain circumstances, such as a delayed resolution of systemic symptoms (eg, greater than five to seven days), or if an alternative diagnosis (eg, lymphoma or tuberculosis) is suspected. If a biopsy sample is obtained, testing should include histology, Warthin-Starry staining, and a <em>B</em>. <em>henselae</em> PCR test, as well as testing to investigate for other disorders. (See <a href=\"#H3621862038\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3749137032\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tests'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4104578141\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bass JW, Vincent JM, Person DA.
