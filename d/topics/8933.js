The lack of historical data and the presence of distracting injuries or altered mental status, from head injury or intoxication, can make these injuries difficult to diagnose and manage. Victims of blunt trauma often have both abdominal and extra-abdominal injuries, further complicating care.</p><p>The initial evaluation and management of patients with blunt abdominal trauma are reviewed here. Discussions of penetrating abdominal trauma, the general management of the acutely injured adult, and ultrasound evaluation in patients with abdominal or thoracic trauma are found separately.

The majority of BAT cases (75 percent) are related to motor vehicle collision (MVC) or auto versus pedestrian accidents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Blows to the abdomen and falls are responsible for 15 and 6 to 9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Occult BAT may occur with child abuse and domestic violence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of intra-abdominal injury among patients presenting to the emergency department with BAT is approximately 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The spleen and liver are the most commonly injured solid organs in BAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Injuries to the pancreas, bowel and mesentery, bladder, and diaphragm, as well as retroperitoneal structures (kidneys, abdominal aorta), are less common but must also be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several pathophysiologic mechanisms can occur in patients with blunt abdominal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A sudden and pronounced rise in intra-abdominal pressure created by outward forces can rupture a hollow viscus. Passengers wearing a lap-belt without a shoulder attachment can sustain injury from such a mechanism when the belt forcefully compresses the abdomen.</p><p>Blunt forces exerted against the anterior abdominal wall can compress abdominal viscera against the posterior thoracic cage or vertebral column, crushing tissue. Solid organs (eg, spleen and liver) are particularly susceptible to laceration or fracture by this mechanism. Elderly and alcoholic patients generally have lax abdominal walls and are more likely to sustain such injuries. Delayed splenic rupture can occur. Retroperitoneal structures, such as the duodenum or pancreas, may be injured.</p><p>Shearing forces created by sudden deceleration can cause lacerations of both solid and hollow organs at their points of attachment to the peritoneum. They may also create tears at vascular pedicles or cause stretch injuries to the intima and media of arteries, resulting in infarction of the susceptible organ. The kidney is most susceptible to such stretch injury.</p><p>Fractured ribs or pelvic bones can lacerate intra-abdominal tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historical features traditionally associated with significant injury following blunt trauma include those listed here, although the diagnostic utility of historical features in blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) remains unclear:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatality at the scene</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vehicle type and velocity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the vehicle rolled over (roll-over mechanism is associated with increased risk of serious injury)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient's location within the vehicle (seat position on the side of impact is associated with serious thoracoabdominal injury in side impact crashes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extent of intrusion into the passenger compartment (intrusion into passenger space &gt;6 inches [15 cm] is associated with increased risk of injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extent of damage to the vehicle</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steering wheel deformity (steering wheel deformity is associated with increased risk of thoracoabdominal injury for front seat passengers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether seat belts were used and, if so, what type (eg, lap belt only increases the risk of Chance fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F60907\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60907 \">image 1</a>))</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether front or side air bags were deployed</p><p/><p>Unrestrained victims are at higher risk of injury than those who are restrained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Paradoxically, steering wheel deformity may be an independent predictor of abdominal injury in front seat passengers, but not drivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of injury to pedestrians varies with the speed and size of the striking vehicle. Pedestrians often sustain a triad of injuries to the leg, torso, and cranium; injury to any of these sites should prompt careful evaluation of the other two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Historical data are important, but mechanism alone cannot reliably predict the need for emergent laparotomy and must be coupled with other information, such as prehospital vital signs, fluctuations in vital signs, examination findings, diagnostic test results (eg, ultrasound), and underlying medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of the trauma patient is directed at rapid stabilization and identification of life threatening injuries, as described in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocols. Primary assessment (ie, the primary survey) follows the ABCDE pattern: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability (neurologic status), and Exposure. Details related to the initial management of blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) are discussed below; basic algorithm for management of BAT is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82663\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82663 \">algorithm 1</a>). The initial evaluation of the trauma patient is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment and examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BAT can manifest a wide range of presentations, from a patient with normal vital signs and minor complaints to an obtunded patient in severe shock. The initial presentation may be benign despite the presence of significant intra-abdominal injury. If evidence of <strong>extra-</strong>abdominal injury exists, the emergency clinician must assess for <strong>intra</strong>-abdominal injury, even in hemodynamically stable patients without abdominal complaints. In the hemodynamically unstable patient, concurrent resuscitation and assessment are paramount. <strong>It is crucial that evaluating clinicians recognize that the absence of abdominal pain or tenderness on physical examination does NOT rule out the presence of significant intra-abdominal injury.</strong></p><p>According to a systematic review of 12 studies involving 10,757 patients, the physical examination findings most strongly associated with intra-abdominal injury following BAT are the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seat belt sign (likelihood ratio (LR) range 5.6 to 9.9) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95085\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95085 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rebound tenderness (uncommon but substantially increases risk when present; LR 6.5, 95% CI 1.8-24)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension (defined as SBP &lt;90 mmHg; LR 5.2, 95% CI 3.5-7.5)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal distension (LR 3.8, 95% CI 1.9-7.6)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal guarding (LR 3.7, 95% CI 2.3-5.9)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant femur fracture (LR 2.9, 95% CI 2.1-4.1) (femur fractures are significant distracting injuries, and may indicate BAT among pedestrians stuck by automobiles). </p><p/><p>Of note, although abdominal pain and abdominal tenderness did increase the likelihood of intra-abdominal injury among patients with BAT, the negative likelihood ratio for each is low, and thus as noted above the absence of either finding <strong>cannot</strong> be used to exclude injury. In addition, while the absence of the above signs and symptoms decreases the likelihood of intra-abdominal injury (LR 0.52-0.96), their absence, alone or in combination, is not sufficient to rule-out intra-abdominal injury. This systematic review included only studies with a clear reference standard (eg, computed tomography [CT], diagnostic peritoneal lavage [DPL], laparotomy) and all were performed at major academic trauma centers.</p><p>The presence of an altered sensorium or painful extra-abdominal injuries in victims of blunt trauma should raise suspicion for abdominal injury, even in the absence of suggestive symptoms or signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Up to 10 percent of patients with an apparently isolated head injury may have concomitant intra-abdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and, according to one prospective observational study, seven percent of blunt trauma patients with distracting extra-abdominal injuries have an abdominal injury despite the absence of abdominal pain or tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In alert patients free of distracting injuries, the most reliable symptoms and signs of BAT are abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, and peritoneal findings, particularly when risk factors for abdominal injury are present. Patients with visceral injury present with local or general abdominal tenderness in up to 90 percent of cases. The presence of pain at the left costal margin has been associated with splenic injury in up to 5.6 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, such signs are not specific, and may also be found with isolated thoracoabdominal wall contusions or lower rib fractures. More importantly, the absence of abdominal tenderness in an awake, hemodynamically stable patient without a distracting extra-abdominal injury indicates that intra-abdominal injury is highly unlikely. Nevertheless, intra-abdominal injury can occur in conscious patients without tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15-18</a>].</p><p>The results of a large prospective observational study suggest that use of a careful, structured physical examination in alert patients following blunt trauma reduces the risk of missing a clinically significant intra-abdominal injury due to an extra- abdominal distracting injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, we believe it is important to remain cautious in such circumstances and to maintain a low threshold for obtaining diagnostic imaging.</p><p>Intra-abdominal injury may cause referred pain. As examples, splenic injury associated with blood adjacent to the left hemidiaphragm may cause referred pain at the left shoulder (Kehr&rsquo;s sign) while a similar phenomenon associated with liver injury may cause referred pain at the right shoulder. </p><p>The digital rectal examination (DRE) has poor sensitivity for bowel injuries and should not be performed routinely. The examination is warranted in some cases, including when urethral or penetrating rectal injury are suspected. The DRE is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H11715737\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Rectum and genitourinary'</a>.) </p><p>Hypotension following BAT most often results from hemorrhage from a solid abdominal organ or intra-abdominal vascular injury. Although clinicians must look for extra-abdominal sources of bleeding (eg, scalp laceration, thoracic injury, or long bone fracture), an extra-abdominal source of hemorrhage never obviates the need to evaluate the peritoneal cavity. Head injury alone cannot explain shock except in rare cases of profound intracranial trauma or in infants who may have significant intracranial bleeding or cephalohematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Abdominal wall ecchymosis, abdominal distention, and decreased bowel sounds may herald intra-abdominal injury. The proverbial &quot;seat belt sign&quot; (ecchymosis over the abdominal wall in the distribution of the seat belt) indicates intra-abdominal injury in up to one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. Abdominal distention, resulting from peritoneal irritation producing an ileus, pneumoperitoneum, or gastric dilation, can indicate significant injury. Clinicians should never wait for such signs of hemoperitoneum, as the blood volume required to create distention exceeds that of the entire vasculature. Decreased bowel sounds can result from chemical peritonitis caused by hemorrhage or from a ruptured hollow viscus. Bowel sounds heard in the chest suggest the presence of diaphragmatic rupture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory tests are generally of limited value in the management of the acutely traumatized patient, but may be helpful in identifying patients at low risk for significant injury when used in combination with other clinical findings. Clinicians should consider laboratory tests adjuncts to diagnosis and not substitutes for clinical assessment in BAT. We do suggest obtaining a microscopic urinalysis in victims of BAT when the presence of intra-abdominal injury is unclear, as microscopic hematuria (&gt;25 RBCs per high power field) increases the likelihood of significant intra-abdominal injury (see the discussion of Urinalysis immediately below). The appropriate use of laboratory tests in the initial evaluation of trauma is reviewed separately; the use of tests of particular relevance to blunt abdominal trauma is discussed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H11715830\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematocrit &ndash; A hematocrit below 30 percent increases the likelihood of intra-abdominal injury in the setting of BAT (LR 3.3, 95% CI 2.4-4.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. Anemia must be interpreted in light of the clinical context, including the extent of hemorrhage, time since the injury, and the amount of exogenous fluid administration. The clinician should <strong>not</strong> be reassured by a normal hematocrit in the acute trauma patient with hypotension; internal hemorrhage should be assumed in such cases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocyte count &ndash; In BAT, the white blood cell (WBC) count is nonspecific and of little value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/15,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23,24</a>]. The positive and negative predictive value of, respectively, an elevated or normal WBC is poor. Catecholamine release due to trauma can cause demargination and may elevate the WBC to 12,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> with a moderate left shift. Solid or hollow viscus injury can cause comparable elevations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatic enzymes &ndash; Normal serum amylase and lipase concentrations cannot exclude significant pancreatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. And while elevated concentrations raise the possibility of pancreatic injury, they may be caused by nonpancreatic abdominal injury as well, and alone are nondiagnostic. If pancreatic injury is suspected, confirmatory studies (eg, CT scan) are needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver function tests &ndash; Hepatic injury is associated with elevations in liver transaminase concentrations (LR 2.5-5.2), and there is some evidence that higher elevations increase the odds for injury, and the likelihood of severe injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24,27,28</a>]. However, patients with comorbidities such as alcohol-induced liver disease or hepatitis may have elevated transaminase concentrations at baseline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis &ndash; Gross hematuria suggests serious renal injury and mandates further investigation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>). According to a meta-analysis of 12 studies, microscopic hematuria (&gt;25 RBCs per high power field), increases the likelihood of significant intra-abdominal injury (LR 3.7-4.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, when the presence of intra-abdominal injury is unclear, it is prudent to perform microscopic urinalysis in victims of BAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a prospective observational study of 196 patients with BAT, the combination of abdominal tenderness and microscopic hematuria was 64 percent sensitive and 94 percent specific in predicting intra-abdominal injury, as determined by abdominal CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Base deficit and lactate &ndash; A prospective, nonrandomized study of BAT patients in two trauma centers found that a base deficit less than -6 was associated with intra-abdominal hemorrhage and the need for laparotomy and blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Clinicians should be aware of these results in the event that such laboratory studies are performed, but the studies are not required in patients with BAT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional tests &ndash; It is reasonable to obtain a pregnancy test in women of childbearing age with BAT. Clinical circumstance should determine the need for further testing (eg, patient taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications would likely prompt coagulation studies). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologic studies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Warnings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiologic studies can provide important information to guide the care of patients with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT), but are not without risk. The traumatized patient must be stabilized before most radiographic studies can be performed, and clinicians must pay careful attention to potential spinal cord injuries and guard against further injury during positioning and transfer for radiographic studies.</p><p>The uncooperative patient may interfere with the performance of radiologic studies, limiting study quality, while putting themselves at risk for cervical spine injury. Clinicians must evaluate the patient to determine the likely cause for their uncooperativeness (eg, hypoxia, traumatic brain injury). Combative patients may require sedation in order to obtain needed studies.</p><p>A clinician familiar with trauma care must accompany any patient who has the potential to deteriorate precipitously. Leaving a patient unattended in the radiology department for even a brief period can have disastrous consequences. In addition to patients with likely intra-abdominal injury, radiographic studies of the abdomen are indicated in stable patients when the physical examination and laboratory tests are inconclusive and the information will guide therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21532075\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs of the abdomen are generally not helpful in the patient with BAT and are not routinely obtained. Patients who have sustained blunt trauma to the torso are at risk for intrathoracic as well as intra-abdominal injury, and plain radiographs of the chest may be helpful depending upon the clinical circumstances. The indications and use of chest imaging in patients with blunt thoracic trauma is reviewed separately.

A retrospective study of 147 blunt trauma patients presenting with low-risk mechanisms of injury (fall from standing, seated position, or from bed) in combination with an unremarkable physical examination (normal mental status, no chest or abdominal pain, no shortness of breath, and no tenderness on examination) reported a very low likelihood of positive findings on CT of the chest or abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The trauma US examination focuses on dependent intraperitoneal sites where blood is most likely to accumulate: the hepatorenal space (Morison's pouch), the splenorenal recess, and the inferior portion of the peritoneal cavity (including pouch of Douglas). These studies, when combined with evaluation of the pericardium (which must not be neglected in the setting of BAT), are referred to as the FAST exam (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma).

After providing initial resuscitation and management based upon protocols from Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), emergency clinicians determine the need for laparotomy using some combination of physical examination, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and diagnostic peritoneal tap <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lavage <span class=\"nowrap\">(DPT/DPL)</span>. In some instances, such as patients with a severe pelvic fracture, angiography may be necessary to control hemorrhage and stabilize the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A basic algorithm for the management of BAT is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82663\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82663 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Immediate trauma surgery consultation is required if the surgeon is not already at the bedside. A FAST exam (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) should be performed on all hemodynamically unstable BAT patients as part of their initial evaluation, assuming US is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.). </p><p>Unstable patients with a positive FAST exam typically go directly to the operating room for emergent laparotomy. If the FAST exam is limited (eg, poor image quality) and the patient is unstable, the surgeon must decide whether suspicion for intra-abdominal injury is sufficiently high to warrant emergent laparotomy. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) has largely been replaced by the combination of US and CT, owing to their speed, sensitivity, and non-invasiveness, but DPL or DPT may be performed in the hemodynamically unstable BAT patient to identify signs of intra-abdominal injury. We suggest CT to evaluate for intra-abdominal (as well as extra-abdominal injuries) in patients who can be resuscitated adequately to undergo scanning. If this cannot be accomplished, an adequate FAST exam cannot be done, and clinicians choose to perform a DPT or DPL, most experts agree that the aspiration of 10 mL of gross blood confirms the presence of a significant intra-abdominal wound that warrants emergent laparotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic peritoneal tap and diagnostic peritoneal lavage'</a>.)</p><p>In unstable patients with no evidence of intra-abdominal injury (negative FAST exam, negative abdominal CT), clinicians must search for alternative sites of hemorrhage or other non-hemorrhagic causes of shock.

If the patient can be stabilized, further evaluation of the intra-abdominal cavity with CT may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic fracture'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamically stable patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of the hemodynamically stable patient with BAT depends upon the clinician&rsquo;s assessment of their risk for significant intra-abdominal injury. The approach selected will vary depending upon many factors, including patient age and comorbidities, mechanism of injury, examination findings, and hospital resources. In general, we follow the approach outlined immediately below, but recognize that any basic plan must be adapted to fit the clinical circumstances. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients deemed low-risk by clinical presentation, vital signs, and laboratory tests (no anemia, elevated transaminase concentrations [if obtained], or hematuria), a nine-hour period of observation that includes serial vital signs and abdominal examinations is generally sufficient to identify patients with occult intra-abdominal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Ultrasound may be incorporated into the serial assessments, although the extent to which it adds to the diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury in low-risk patients remains unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients at low risk for intra-abdominal injury, including those with a negative abdominal CT scan, an observation period shorter than nine hours may be reasonable in many cases, but there is as yet no high quality evidence to support this approach. Such decisions must be made by the clinician on a case-by-case basis using their clinical judgement. Before discharge, all patients should be instructed to return to the emergency department (ED) immediately for any concerning symptom, such as new or worsening abdominal pain, and informed about the limitations of the CT scan for diagnosing injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without a high-risk clinical presentation but with laboratory findings associated with intra-abdominal injury (hematocrit &lt;30 percent, AST or ALT &gt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L,</span> microscopic hematuria &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">RBCs/HPF),</span> CT is the preferred modality for identifying such injuries. If a CT is obtained and is negative, a nine-hour period of observation that includes serial vital signs and abdominal examinations is generally sufficient to identify patients with injuries that CT may have missed (eg, bowel injury). For patients with persistent pain or tenderness (eg, persistent tenderness on examinations performed 30 minutes apart) despite a negative CT, admission for observation and surgical consultation is warranted. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are hemodynamically stable but whose presentation or examination includes one or more findings associated with an increased risk for intra-abdominal injury, an abdominal CT is performed. As above, patients with persistent pain or tenderness despite a negative CT are admitted for observation and surgical consultation is warranted. High risk examination findings are reviewed above and include the following: hypotension, peritoneal signs (eg, abdominal guarding, rebound tenderness), abdominal distension, and seat belt sign. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether routine whole-body imaging with CT leads to better outcomes among high-risk patients than selective imaging (ie, directed by clinical suspicion) is controversial.

Each method of patient evaluation has limitations, and there are a number of reasonable approaches.</p><p>In the stable BAT patient, ultrasound may miss clinically relevant injuries, and we do not advocate its use as a single definitive screening test in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. The accuracy of ultrasound evaluation for detecting intra-abdominal injury improves with serial examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. If an ultrasound examination is performed and detects intraperitoneal blood, the patient should undergo abdominal CT scan to delineate intraperitoneal injuries and quantify the hemoperitoneum. The surgeon may choose either admission with nonoperative management or immediate laparotomy depending upon the injuries detected and the patient's clinical status. </p><p>We recommend that CT imaging be performed for any patient with one or more high risk clinical findings, and in any patient with persistent abdominal pain or tenderness on serial examinations (eg, persistent tenderness on exams performed 30 minutes apart). Abdominal CT may also be needed for patients who are hemodynamically stable, but whose sensorium or reliability is altered by closed head injury, drug or alcohol intoxication, or significant distracting injury.</p><p>The decision of whether to perform an abdominal CT early on or follow the patient with serial physical examinations is made largely on clinical grounds. Serial physical examination is reserved for the patient whose examination is deemed reliable (ie, patients with a normal sensorium and no severe distracting injury). Given increasing concerns regarding the adverse effects of the radiation from CT scans, many trauma centers are making increased use of serial examinations and standardized clinical assessments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Serial abdominal examinations and serial ultrasound evaluations may be useful in select hemodynamically stable BAT patients. As an example, a non-intoxicated patient who is not elderly and manifests no gross neurologic abnormalities (normal Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS]) or high-risk clinical features would be a suitable candidate for observation with serial assessments.</p><p>Clinical assessment of an alert, non-intoxicated BAT patient that depends solely on abdominal examination findings is reasonably accurate but not infallible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One prospective observational study of such patients, with no signs of external trauma and a normal abdominal examination, found clinically significant abnormalities in 7.1 percent of patients using CT findings as the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Significance in this study was defined as any alteration in treatment that resulted directly from the abdominal CT. The use and limitations of the abdominal examination in BAT are discussed further above. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment and examination'</a> above.)</p><p>The accuracy of serial examinations continues to be debated, as has the period of observation necessary to identify significant intra-abdominal injuries. One retrospective cohort study performed at an academic trauma center found that all patients with serious intra-abdominal injuries in whom initial imaging was deferred were identified within nine hours using serial examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In this study, all 80 patients whose injuries required intervention (surgery or embolization) manifested clinical symptoms or signs within an average of 74 minutes of arrival. Another retrospective study of trauma patients observed in the emergency department for eight hours, whose vital signs, hematocrit measurements, and examinations remained stable and within normal limits, reported that only 0.4 percent sustained an intra-abdominal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. While a strategy of serial observation requires careful selection of patients in whom reliable examinations can be performed, these studies suggest that this approach is safe and feasible in patients deemed to be at low-risk by virtue of their initial vital signs, diagnostic studies, and signs and symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical indications for laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonoperative management (NOM) has become standard for all but the most severely injured BAT patients. Immediate laparotomy after injury from a blunt mechanism is rarely based solely on clinical parameters. Potential indications include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained signs of blood loss or hypotension in a patient who cannot be stabilized and in whom intra-abdominal injury is strongly suspected</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear and persistent signs of peritoneal irritation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiologic evidence of pneumoperitoneum consistent with a viscus rupture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of a diaphragmatic rupture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent, significant GI bleeding seen in nasogastric drainage or vomitus</p><p/><p>Establishing the need for urgent celiotomy on clinical grounds is particularly problematic in the patient with multiple blunt injuries. Numerous extra-abdominal sources of hemorrhage may exist. Head injury or intoxication often coexist with abdominal trauma, further impairing the reliability of examination findings. Laparotomy may imperil the patient when more crucial diagnostic and therapeutic steps are delayed. Where confusion exists, we strongly prefer that corroborative diagnostic tests be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a pelvic fracture and evidence of ongoing bleeding (ie, hemodynamic instability), the presence or absence of hemoperitoneum determines management. Detection of free fluid by US or gross intraperitoneal blood by DPT accurately predicts active intraperitoneal hemorrhage and the need for emergent laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/51,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,55,56</a>]. The absence of intraperitoneal blood as determined by US or DPT suggests major retroperitoneal hemorrhage, assuming there is no extra-abdominal source of bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is an important exception when intraperitoneal fluid detected by US does not represent hemorrhage. Major pelvic fracture can be associated with intraperitoneal bladder rupture. In such cases, the free intraperitoneal fluid found on US is uroperitoneum rather than hemoperitoneum. Intraperitoneal bladder rupture requires surgical repair but not emergently.</p><p>Patients with a major pelvic fracture are at risk for life-threatening retroperitoneal hemorrhage. As such, some clinicians perform a DPT in the hemodynamically unstable patient with major pelvic fracture and a positive US in order to distinguish hemoperitoneum, which requires exigent laparotomy, from uroperitoneum, and to help decide whether to perform diagnostic and potentially therapeutic pelvic angiography as the next step. Urgent laparotomy for bladder repair is performed thereafter.</p><p>After carefully examining the perineum and rectum, clinicians should place a pelvic stabilization device (prefabricated pelvic binder, or a bed sheet tied tightly around the pelvis) on any potentially unstable pelvic fracture that may be contributing to hemodynamic instability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73047\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73047 \">image 5</a>). External fixation devices are generally placed in the operating room because placement can be difficult and time-consuming and may interfere with other components of resuscitation. Following stabilization with pelvic angiography and embolization, abdominal CT may be used to look further for intraperitoneal injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple system injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians cannot approach the management of the abdominal trauma patient with more than one life-threatening injury dogmatically. At major trauma centers, clinicians regularly confront the problem of intraperitoneal hemorrhage in a patient with apparent closed head injury and suspected blunt aortic disruption. Traditionally, laparotomy to control intraperitoneal hemorrhage takes precedence over operative management of head or chest trauma. However, these situations are complex, and decision-making is influenced by numerous dynamic variables. In general, a patient with known hemoperitoneum who cannot be stabilized must first undergo laparotomy for life-saving hemostasis before other injuries are addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Closed head injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients presenting with BAT and concomitant closed head injury, the necessity and timing of neurosurgical intervention is directed by the patient&rsquo;s neurologic examination (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], presence of lateralizing neurologic signs), and CT imaging results. Immediate consultation with a neurosurgeon and trauma surgeon is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Transfers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A trauma patient at a small rural hospital may need a laparotomy for hemorrhage control before being transferred to a trauma center for definitive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noteworthy historical features include (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fatality at the scene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vehicle type and velocity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether the vehicle rolled over</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patient's location within the vehicle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extent of intrusion into the passenger compartment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extent of damage to the vehicle; steering wheel deformity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether seat belts were used and what type (unrestrained victims are at higher risk of injury); whether air bags deployed </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pedestrians often sustain a triad of injuries to the leg, torso, and cranium; injury to any of these sites should prompt careful evaluation of the others. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The signs and symptoms of abdominal injury are often attenuated in adults over 60 years, and clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for injuries in this population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of BAT varies widely, from minor complaints to severe shock. The accuracy of the physical examination is limited. The initial presentation may be benign despite the presence of major intra-abdominal injury. Clinicians must look for intra-abdominal injury in all BAT patients with an altered sensorium or extra-abdominal injuries. Examination findings associated with intra-abdominal injury include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seat belt sign </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rebound tenderness </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypotension </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal distension </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal guarding </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe distracting injury (eg, femur fracture) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Note that the absence of such findings does <strong>not</strong> exclude intra-abdominal injury. If the patient is awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable, and is free of abdominal pain or tenderness, intra-abdominal injury is unlikely. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Notify the blood bank immediately and directly (ie, by telephone or in person) of the need for transfusion should a BAT patient present with life-threatening bleeding. Order a blood type and screen for any victim of significant trauma. Routine hematology and chemistry laboratory tests are of limited value in the management of the acutely traumatized patient, but may be helpful in identifying patients at low risk for significant injury when used in combination with other clinical findings. We suggest obtaining a microscopic urinalysis in victims of BAT when the presence of intra-abdominal injury is unclear, as microscopic hematuria (&gt;25 RBCs per high power field) increases the likelihood of significant intra-abdominal injury. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The traumatized patient must be stabilized before most abdominal radiographic studies (eg, computed tomography [CT]) can be performed. Clinicians must pay careful attention to potential spinal cord injuries and guard against exacerbating such an injury during positioning. Patients must be closely monitored while in the radiology area. The indications, advantages, and disadvantages of the major modalities for imaging BAT are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the hemodynamically unstable patient with BAT, management hinges on determining the presence or absence of intraperitoneal hemorrhage. The emergency clinician performs a focused abdominal ultrasound (US) exam (or in some instances a diagnostic peritoneal tap [DPT]), to make this determination. Hemoperitoneum in the clinically unstable patient without other apparent injury mandates laparotomy. For patients without hemoperitoneum, clinicians search for extra-abdominal sites of hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically unstable patient'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Clinical indications for laparotomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of the hemodynamically stable patient with BAT depends upon the clinician&rsquo;s assessment of their risk for significant injury. Patients at increased risk based upon their presentation, examination findings, or laboratory study results are evaluated by CT. Several approaches may be used to assess low-risk patients and these are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically stable patient'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prompt consultation with a trauma center is paramount for those patients with severe BAT presenting to a small emergency department without the capacity to manage such injuries.
