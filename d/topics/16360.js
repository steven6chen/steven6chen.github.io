In these settings, the approach to selecting empiric therapy is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Life-threatening infection (community- or healthcare-associated)</strong> &ndash; For children with life-threatening infection with suspected SAB, empiric therapy consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nafcillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxacillin</a>; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rifampin</a> may be added for potential synergy in selected circumstances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61437\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61437 \">table 1</a>). The combination of vancomycin plus nafcillin or oxacillin maximizes coverage for both MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA).

These are the antibiotics of choice when treating bacteremia caused by methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em> (MSSA).

The approach is summarized in the table and is discussed in greater detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61437\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61437 \">table 1</a>).

Clindamycin is bacteriostatic for <em>S. aureus</em> and thus is not routinely used for the initial treatment of SAB.</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> is generally efficacious for the treatment of MRSA, it is less effective than beta-lactams for methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em> (MSSA). Thus, once results of susceptibility testing are known, <em>S. aureus</em> isolates that are methicillin- or penicillin-susceptible should be treated with beta-lactams rather than vancomycin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57379 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>If MRSA is not isolated within 72 to 96 hours after antibiotics are initiated, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> (or other empiric MRSA-targeting antibiotics) can be discontinued; commercial methods for rapid detection of MSSA may allow for earlier discontinuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This approach requires that clinicians be aggressive in obtaining cultures from all appropriate sites in addition to blood cultures. Aspiration or surgical incision and drainage of bone or joint infections should be performed within 48 hours of starting antibiotic treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H199989726\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Sites to culture'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children#H23734867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial arthritis: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Synovial fluid'</a>.)</p><p>For some patients with serious infections for which <em>S. aureus</em> remains a potential pathogen despite negative cultures, it may be reasonable to continue therapy with an anti-MRSA antibiotic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">linezolid</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>). The decision depends on the site of infection. Continued therapy despite negative cultures may be warranted for osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and culture-negative endocarditis. This is discussed in separate topic reviews.

The initial treatment is with parenteral antibiotics. Many patients can be converted to an oral regimen once they have clinically improved.

If the catheter is removed and bacteremia clears promptly, no further studies usually are necessary, unless new clinical concerns arise.

However, the benefits of catheter removal must be weighed against the potential difficulty of obtaining alternative venous access. It is reasonable to attempt to clear the infection without removing the catheter in select children, particularly those who require central venous access for survival and those in whom alternative sites for catheter placement are limited. In patients &gt;1 month old, antimicrobial treatment without catheter removal is reasonable if the child is not in shock, responds promptly to medical therapy (ie, fever resolves and bacteremia clears), and has no evidence of an infected thrombus or distant sites of infection. If the catheter remains in place, both systemic antibiotics and antibiotic lock therapy may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Observational studies have reported successful management in 50 to 80 percent of children treated without catheter removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].
