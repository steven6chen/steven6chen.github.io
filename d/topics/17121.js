Spinal alignment, structural asymmetry, soft tissue masses, skin lesions, and points of tenderness should be noted. The vertebral column should be straight, with alignment along an imaginary vertical line from the midpoint of the occiput to the gluteal cleft. The level of the shoulders, scapulae, and pelvic rims should be symmetrical.</p><p>Any midline soft tissue lesion overlying the spine (eg, dimple, vascular anomaly, pigmented nevus, hairy patch) should raise suspicion of an underlying neurologic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Defects of the bony spine or of the overlying skin or soft tissue in an infant may indicate the presence of a meningocele, myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, diastematomyelia, abscess, or tumor. With many of these lesions, the neurologic deficits may be sufficiently severe to lead to genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower-extremity impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H2828285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Cutaneous'</a>.)</p><p>Midline dimples in the skin overlying the coccyx generally are of no significance. Dimples above the gluteal cleft and on or above the flat part of the sacrum (ie, lumbosacral dermal sinus tracts) usually require neuroimaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurosurgical evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H72372497\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Scoliosis in the neonate has great significance because it produces cosmetic problems and potential visceral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic dysfunction. Almost 33 percent of children with congenital scoliosis have associated urinary tract anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Flattened buttocks and shortening of the cephalad extent of the gluteal cleft is the classic sign of sacral agenesis. The clinician should ask the caregiver about maternal type 1 diabetes and must order a lateral radiologic image of the lower spine to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>Darkly pigmented neonates and infants may have bluish macular skin lesions over the back termed congenital dermal melanocytosis (also called Mongolian spots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77805\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77805 \">picture 1</a>)). These lesions are benign accumulations of elliptical melanocytes that regress spontaneously after one to two years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-skin-and-scalp-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign skin and scalp lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;, section on 'Congenital dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian spot)'</a>.)</p><p>All patients, particularly children in the preadolescent years, should undergo examination of the spine for scoliosis. Acquired scoliosis in preadolescents may herald important pathology (eg, spinal cord or vertebral bone tumors). On the other hand, idiopathic scoliosis, which is most common in adolescent girls, can usually be followed with observation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Proper examination requires unobstructed visualization of the back. The patient should be standing straight, but not rigid, with feet together and arms at the sides. Asymmetry of the back structures should be noted. For the second phase of the examination, the patient should be asked to bend over at the waist with legs straight, feet together, arms in a dependent position with the tips of the thumbs apposed, and head directed toward the floor in a relaxed position. The presence of a rib hump or abnormal curvature should be noted.</p><p>In addition to inspection for scoliosis, the spine should be examined for kyphosis and lordosis. A normal lumbar lordotic curvature, giving rise to a pot-bellied appearance, is found in most toddlers. Spontaneous resolution of the curvature occurs in almost all as they advance into early childhood. Mild lumbar lordosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thoracic kyphosis require no intervention; more prominent forms of either deformity warrant thorough evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTREMITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to examination of the extremities in the older child and adolescent is similar to that of the adult; examination of infants and younger children requires an understanding of anatomical limitations and acceptable variations in normal alignment. Examination should begin with careful visualization of the upper and lower extremities, looking for appropriate alignment, unusual masses or protuberances, joint deformities, missing or fused digits, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> integument abnormalities. Attention should be paid to muscle mass. Adverse effects from maternal drugs, congenital defects, and <span class=\"nowrap\">chromosomal/genetic</span> abnormalities may cause limb deformities and limb-length discrepancies.</p><p>Physical examination of the extremities includes determining the range of motion of all joints. Normal, full-term, newborn infants have significant flexion contractures of the upper and lower extremities, limiting the range of motion. Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, supination, pronation, eversion, and inversion should be demonstrated within the normal anatomical limits of the particular joint. Variation from normal between paired joints and extremities also should be noted. For older children, the clinician should evaluate gait as well as the sitting and standing postures.</p><p>Palpation of the extremities should be done to determine areas of tenderness, swelling, and increased or decreased temperature. Any one or all of these findings may be noted at sites of fracture, bone or joint disease, infection, and sprain. Clavicular fractures in the newborn may be undetected in the immediate neonatal period; on subsequent examination of the clavicles, they may have unilateral or bilateral swelling (callous formation) and tenderness.</p><p>The tone and strength of the muscles should be examined. Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, who have pseudohypertrophy of muscle groups, will (deceptively) appear to have adequate muscle mass, despite having decreased muscle tone and strength. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Femoral anteversion, tibial torsion, and metatarsus adductus commonly are found in infants and toddlers. The vast majority of these anatomical variations are present as a result of in utero positioning and tend to correct spontaneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-positional-deformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity positional deformations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with in-toeing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the early months of walking, infants have a normal, wide-based gait; the legs often are rotated externally, and the feet are flat. The more normal gait of childhood develops with anatomical and neurologic maturity. Toe walking, found in patients with cerebral palsy, may be a transient finding in some normal infants. Passive range of motion of the foot will help distinguish a tight heel cord that is limiting normal dorsiflexion from the full range of motion seen in the otherwise normal toe walker.</p><p>Toeing in and toeing out, seen frequently in early childhood, generally correct over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with in-toeing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with out-toeing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Developmental dysplasia of the hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thorough examination of the hips for evidence of joint laxity or dislocation should be performed on every infant from shortly after birth until several months after independent walking. Findings compatible with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) may be detected in the newborn period; abnormal signs present at that time may disappear. The clinical features of DDH are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Child with a limp</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Possible causes of a limp in children include infection; neuromuscular or neurologic problems; primary bone, cartilage, ligament, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> joint abnormalities; allergic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammatory processes; cancer; mass lesions; and foreign bodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of limp in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with a limp&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hip pain in childhood&quot;, section on 'Common causes of hip pain in children'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete discussion of the neurologic examination is presented elsewhere. Except in an unusual situation, a thorough neurologic examination of every patient is not necessary. Patients who present with or who are found to have neurologic or neuromuscular abnormalities on examination should undergo a complete neurologic assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aside from the sequence in which it is performed, the neurologic examination of a child varies little from that of an adult. Neurologic assessment of older children and adolescents begins with determining mental status, followed by the cranial nerves, muscle tone and strength, deep tendon reflexes, cerebellar function, and sensory responses.</p><p>Adequate examination of the infant and younger child usually requires the protective security provided by the caregiver's lap and the use of toys and bright objects to provide diversion or visual attention. The method of determining mental status depends upon the child's age. For the infant and younger child, mental status is based upon language and motor skills, as well as social interaction.</p><p>The sensory, motor, and cerebellar examinations might begin with the lower extremities in infants and young children; for school-aged children, the examinations begin with the head, neck, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper extremities. With the exception of the first cranial nerve (not often or easily tested in infants and small children), cranial nerve function can be tested in much the same way as in adults.</p><p>Assessing cerebellar and motor function and strength in the infant or toddler requires close observation. While the patient is engaged in normal activity, the examiner should look for appropriate alternate or symmetric movement of the trunk, head, and extremities. Upper-extremity muscle tone and strength can be assessed in various ways. For the infant as young as four months, an examiner can make the determination based upon the ability of the patient to pull to a sitting position while holding onto the examiner's fingers. Alternatively, assessment can be judged by noting an infant's upper-trunk resistance against the examiner's hands held under the patient's axillae as he or she is being lifted into the air. Lower-extremity tone and strength can be assessed by noting an infant's ability to bear weight while standing supported.</p><p>Deep tendon reflexes can be elicited at any age, but in infants younger than 33 weeks' gestation, reflex responses are diminished. In preterm and late-preterm infants, an examiner's finger placed over the tendon to be tested can be lightly struck with a percussion hammer to elicit a reflex. Complete absence of deep tendon reflexes may be attributable to anterior horn cell disease or peripheral neuropathy. Deep tendon reflexes with an exaggerated response can occur as a result of upper motor neuron pathology.</p><p>Many developmental reflexes present in the newborn disappear within the first year of life. The rooting, palmar grasp, and Moro reflexes are gone by two to four months of age; the tonic neck response disappears by three to six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Plantar flexion of the toes, elicited by firm finger pressure at the plantar metatarsal-phalangeal joint area, may be present for the first several months of life. Dorsiflexion of the great toe and fanning of the smaller toes (Babinski reflex), elicited by stroking the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of the foot in a posterior to anterior direction, is a normal finding up to approximately 18 months of age. For older patients, the normal Babinski reflex is characterized by plantar flexion of the great toe with no movement of the other toes.</p><p>In males, the cremasteric reflex can be demonstrated by stroking the inner thigh area in an anterior to posterior direction and noting ipsilateral scrotal retraction and testicular rise. The lack of response or an asymmetric response is compatible with a corticospinal tract abnormality. Occasionally, the response will be absent in otherwise normal boys younger than six months and older than 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the skin requires careful inspection and palpation. When describing individual skin abnormalities, the examiner should describe color and size and whether the lesions, tumors, rashes, or defects are raised or flat, coalescent or isolated, well localized or diffuse, pruritic or nonpruritic. Terms such as papule, macule, pustule, vesicle, bullae, and nodule describe the appearance of <span class=\"nowrap\">rashes/lesions</span> and have meaning for most health professionals. Because skin lesions from different causes can have the same appearance, however, the clinician must be careful to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the correct treatment. The history and physical examination are of significant benefit in helping to differentiate among various disorders.</p><p>Essentially all lesions originating in the skin of children are benign. Lesions without an altered appearance of the epidermis, however, may not be easy to categorize. A mass that moves freely over the underlying fascia most likely is present in the subcutaneous tissue and should be considered benign. Malignancy is a possibility when the lesion is fixed to the underlying fascia or the examiner is unsure of what is being felt; an appropriate referral should be made in this circumstance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Palpation of the skin may reveal rough, coarse, or dry areas in the region of the neck, knee, or elbow, which often are found in patients with atopic dermatitis. Large patches of coarse papular lesions palpable over the dorsal surfaces of the upper arms and thighs of an older child or adolescent may be compatible with hyperkeratosis pilaris. An elongated or patchy area of moist, erythematous, denuded, pruritic skin may be seen in patients with contact dermatitis caused by poison ivy. Pink, raised, pruritic lesions of various sizes and shapes, diffusely scattered over the body, are found in patients with urticaria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin color</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variations from normal skin color could indicate a previously undiagnosed disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Carotenemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A yellow tint to the skin may be compatible with carotenemia or jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia). Carotenemia can be found in infants and toddlers whose diets consist of large amounts of strained yellow vegetables, particularly carrots and other carotenoid-containing fruits and vegetables. Carotenoids include alpha- and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>, and lycopene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. They are contained in carrots, sweet potatoes, mangoes, apricots, melons, tomatoes, peppers, and green leafy vegetables. In addition, beta-carotene is frequently used as a food-coloring agent.</p><p>Unlike jaundice, the skin color characteristically is more yellow-orange and more noticeable in areas with increased sweat glands (eg, the palms, soles, and nasolabial folds), sparing mucosal tissue and the sclerae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although diet is a major cause of carotenemia in childhood, some diseases, such as nephrosis, diabetes mellitus, anorexia nervosa, liver disease, and hypothyroidism, also can produce the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Jaundice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jaundice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73199\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73199 \">picture 2</a>) can be differentiated from carotenemia by the yellow-green skin color, yellow sclerae and mucous membranes, and the darkly colored urine and lightly colored stools. Collection of bile pigment accounts for the change in tissue color. Disorders giving rise to hyperbilirubinemia include neonatal (physiologic) jaundice, hemolytic anemias, hepatitis, enzyme defects, and biliary tree obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Spider nevi appear most commonly on exposed areas of the face, upper trunk, arms, hands, and fingers. They are associated with liver disease, pregnancy, and estrogen therapy but also may occur in individuals without these conditions. In an observational study, 38 percent of 426 children (aged 1 to 15 years) without liver disease had &ge;1 spider nevus; most had between one and four; only 7 children (1.6 percent) had &ge;5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

They are typically several centimeters long and 1 to 10 mm wide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Initially pink or purple, striae later become white, translucent, and atrophic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Striae occasionally may mimic physical abuse or nonaccidental injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Striae tend to occur in areas of excessive stretching of the skin, eg, the abdomen, lower back, breasts, buttocks, and thighs. Individuals who have gained an exceptional amount of weight in a short period of time, females who are pregnant, and pubescent adolescents experiencing rapid overall growth frequently exhibit such skin changes. Striae also may occur in patients with anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Adolescents engaged in weight-lifting programs may develop striae of the shoulder and chest areas. Excessive adrenocortical activity (Cushing's disease), as well as prolonged use of oral and potent topical corticosteroids, can lead to striae formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67682\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67682 \">picture 13</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The precise etiology accounting for striae formation is not clearly understood. A possible explanation is that stress-related rupture of the connective tissue framework occurs along with destruction of collagen and elastin. Corticosteroids produce striae by suppressing fibroblastic activity, allowing for newly synthesized collagen to fill the gap between ruptured collagen fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Striae appearing during adolescence tend to regress spontaneously over time. Among various treatments used for persistent or cosmetically unacceptable striae, topical retinoids, flash-lamp pulsed dye laser, and chemical peels may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Other skin lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the more common skin lesions seen in childhood are warts, pyogenic granulomata, and sebaceous (epidermal) cysts. The examiner should be suspicious of a potential underlying neurologic defect whenever a pigmented lesion (with or without a tuft of hair), a vascular lesion, a soft tissue mass, or a skin defect is found over the midline of the head, neck, or back.</p><p>Though cosmetically unattractive, warts on the hands and feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72268%7EPC%2F62168%7EDERM%2F56924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72268 graphicRef62168 graphicRef56924 \">picture 14A-C</a>) do not always require treatment, and most regress spontaneously. Warts in the genital or perianal areas should alert the examiner to the possibility of sexual abuse.

The approach should be symmetric and sequential (eg, beginning with simultaneous palpation of the occipital and posterior cervical nodes, followed by palpation of the anterior cervical nodes, preauricular and postauricular nodes, submental nodes, supraclavicular nodes, axillary nodes, and inguinal nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69528 \">figure 1</a>)).</p><p>Routine examination of the lymph nodes includes attention to size, mobility, tenderness, adhesion to adjacent tissues, and the temperature and condition of the overlying skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Nodes that grow slowly generally are benign; those that grow rapidly and are rubbery, hard, nontender, and matted tend to be malignant. Enlarged, tender nodes with increased warmth to the overlying skin usually are infected.</p><p>In normal children between two years of age and early adolescence, superficial, enlarged, freely movable, nontender lymph nodes are easily palpable, particularly in the anterior cervical chain. Cervical and inguinal nodes 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter are found frequently but generally remain enlarged only for a short period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Nodes up to 3 mm in diameter in the axilla and submandibular areas often are found in the otherwise normal child. Palpable posterior auricular, occipital, submental, supraclavicular, epitrochlear, and popliteal nodes are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].
