Women are affected in 80 to 90 percent of cases, with an age of onset that is usually between 10 and 40 years.</p><p>TA primarily affects the aorta and its primary branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62022\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62022 \">table 1</a>). The initial vascular lesions frequently occur in the left middle or proximal subclavian artery. As the disease progresses, the left common carotid and vertebral, brachiocephalic, right middle or proximal subclavian, right carotid and vertebral arteries, as well as the aorta, may also be affected. The abdominal aorta and pulmonary arteries are involved in approximately 50 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The inflammatory processes cause thickening of the walls of the affected arteries. The proximal aorta (eg, aortic root) may become dilated secondary to inflammatory injury. Narrowing, occlusion, or dilation of involved portions of the arteries in varying degrees results in a wide variety of symptoms.</p><p>The treatment of TA will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of therapy for Takayasu arteritis (TA) is glucocorticoids. Angioplasty, bypass grafts, or other surgery may be necessary once large aneurysms develop or irreversible arterial stenosis has occurred. Treatment of hypertension and heart failure should be instituted if these complications occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids effectively suppress the systemic symptoms and usually arrest progression of TA. The normochromic anemia and elevated acute-phase reactants also return to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Arterial stenosis may reverse, and ischemic symptoms may improve in early cases. However, the vascular response is diminished once fibrous tissue has formed in the involved vessels or once thrombosis has occurred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial glucocorticoid dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An initial daily dose of 45 to 60 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent dose should be started in an adult of average size. A single morning dose is usually effective and convenient. Divided daily doses provide a more continuous antiinflammatory effect but may result in an increased number of adverse reactions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>). Alternate-day glucocorticoid doses are generally not as effective as daily therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessing response to treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108145822\"><span class=\"h4\">Clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring disease activity may be challenging for clinicians, given the absence of specific laboratory tests or validated assessment criteria for disease activity. During treatment, we monitor for a decrease and eventual disappearance of constitutional symptoms, accompanied by a decrease in acute-phase reactants such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.</p><p>Although only used for research purposes, efforts are undergoing to develop a quantitative clinical assessment instrument. The Indian Takayasu Clinical Activity Score (ITAS2010), and a composite ITAS-A which includes acute-phase reactants (ESR or CRP), have been validated in over 300 patients and provide a quantitative score of clinical disease activity for patient monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108145828\"><span class=\"h4\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can also be used to follow the response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The potential efficacy of this approach was evaluated in 31 patients in whom repeat CT angiography was performed over a median period of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms were initially noted in 12 patients (approximately 40 percent) and subsequently developed in two during follow-up. Rapidly increasing aneurysmal size (more than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year)</span> occurred in three patients despite glucocorticoid therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62264%7ERHEUM%2F70960\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62264 graphicRef70960 \">image 1A-B</a>); this was accompanied by mural thickening (suggestive of continued disease activity), eventually culminating in aortic rupture.</p><p>Vascular wall edema demonstrated by MRI, in the absence of other clinical evidence of active disease, does not appear to be a sufficient reason for more aggressive therapy. This point was illustrated by a study in which there was poor correlation between the appearance of MRI detected vessel wall edema and the presence or absence of active vasculitis, as determined clinically by subsequent development of stenotic or aneurysmal dilation or by pathologic examination of resected vessel walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Tapering glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The glucocorticoid dose can be gradually reduced when the symptoms and laboratory tests related to the inflammatory process have improved. We recommend a maximum reduction of 10 percent of the daily amount per week. Long-term, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy may be necessary to prevent progression of arterial stenoses. Glucocorticoids can be discontinued if the disease goes into remission, while the dose should be increased if exacerbations occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Preventing glucocorticoid adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the duration of glucocorticoid use and the cumulative dose cannot be predicted at the outset of treatment, attention to prevention of potential adverse effects of glucocorticoids is warranted.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid-induced bone mineral loss &ndash; Prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Summarized briefly, supplementation with calcium and vitamin D are recommended. Prophylactic use of an oral bisphosphonate (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a>) can be initiated while awaiting results of an initial study of bone mineral density. If osteoporosis is present, full-dose regimens rather than prophylactic treatment are warranted.

The adjunctive use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and other agents may have some value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> was evaluated in an open-label study of 18 such patients, 16 of whom were followed for a mean of almost three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Weekly administration of methotrexate (mean stable dose 17.1 mg) plus glucocorticoids resulted in remissions in 13 of 16 patients (81 percent). Relapse occurred in seven (44 percent) when the glucocorticoids were tapered near or to discontinuation. Retreatment again led to remission, and three of seven patients in this group successfully stopped glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p>Of those patients who achieved remission, eight (50 percent) sustained the remission at a mean of 18 months of follow-up; four patients in this group had not required either drug for a mean of 11 months. Disease progression occurred in three patients in spite of treatment. Further long-term studies are required to assess the durability of remission and the need for maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy in this subset of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H840242\"><span class=\"h3\">Leflunomide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A favorable response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> was observed in an open-label study in 12 of 15 patients with TA whose disease had been refractory to conventional therapy with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After a mean follow-up period of nine months, there was a significant reduction in disease activity scores, acute-phase reactants, and glucocorticoid use.

In an observational study of 21 TA patients followed for a mean of 9.6 months, 20 patients demonstrated improvement in disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although all of the patients required concomitant steroids, there was a significant decrease in steroid dosage at the time of follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108145914\"><span class=\"h3\">Tocilizumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benefits have also been reported in several reported cases of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. The only randomized trial comparing tocilizumab with placebo in patients with refractory TA favored the tocilizumab-treated group; however, the primary endpoint of time to relapse in the intention-to-treat analysis with 18 patients in each group was not met (8 versus 11 patients, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.41; 95% CI 0.15-1.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Angioplasty is preferable when the lesions are amenable to catheter-based therapy. However, percutaneous intervention is less likely to be successful when stenoses or occlusions affect lengthy portions of an artery or when the artery is heavily scarred.</p><p>Continued inflammation in a treated segment may result in restenosis following angioplasty, with or without stenting; restenosis is less likely following bypass grafting than angioplasty, when performed after initiation of treatment or when revascularization is followed by antiinflammatory therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic valve surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive aortic regurgitation (AR) may require surgical therapy either with valve replacement or with valve repair.

The 15-year survival was 66 and 96 percent for patients with and without a major complication, respectively, and was 68 and 93 percent for those with and without a progressive course, respectively. The presence of both a major complication and progressive course was the worst prognostic indicator (43 percent survival at 15 years). In contrast, no patient died who had neither of these manifestations. These variables may identify a subset of patients who require more aggressive medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical therapy.</p><p>The long-term prognosis among patients who required surgical revascularization was addressed in a study of 106 such Japanese patients followed for a mean of 19.8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In patients with disease refractory to glucocorticoids, we recommend trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> and reserve <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> for those who have continued disease activity despite those medications. Additional evidence is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> in this setting.

Angioplasty is preferable when the lesions are amenable to catheter-based therapy. However, percutaneous intervention is less likely to be successful when stenoses or occlusions affect lengthy portions of an artery or when the artery is heavily scarred. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive aortic regurgitation (AR) may require surgical therapy, either with valve replacement or with valve repair. Surgery is more difficult in this disorder since the tissue is fragile and inflamed. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Aortic valve surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TA is a chronic disease. The degree of activity over time varies, with apparent exacerbations and reductions (or remissions) in the intensity of the inflammatory processes. Vascular involvement tends to be progressive, although the short-term prognosis is favorable. The disease may eventually burn out.
