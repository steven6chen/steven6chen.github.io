Plaque rupture often leads to thrombus formation and persistent thrombotic occlusion results in acute myocardial infarction (MI). This topic will review the evidence that antiplatelet therapy is beneficial in patients with an acute non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) or unstable angina and will provide recommendations for its use.

There is no evidence that higher doses are more effective and they may lead to greater gastric irritation. Aspirin (75 to 100 mg once a day) should be continued indefinitely for secondary prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Early evidence of benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> came from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, which reviewed the effect of antiplatelet therapy, mostly aspirin (in doses ranging from 75 to 1500 mg daily) in nearly 200,000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Aspirin therapy may be associated with gastrointestinal intolerance, including bleeding, or worsening of preexistent bleeding outside the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal side effects such as dyspepsia and nausea are infrequent with the low doses used in this setting. Patients who develop gastrointestinal side effects should be treated with a proton pump inhibitor and are usually then able to tolerate a lower dose (75 to 100 mg of aspirin per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Enteric-coated aspirin may be of some benefit, but it does not protect against gastrointestinal bleeding.

The choice of the P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor blocker<sub> </sub>and the timing<sub> </sub>of administration depends on the choice between invasive ischemia-guided management strategies, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H4276885943\" class=\"local\">'Invasive management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2661491264\" class=\"local\">'Ischemia-guided management'</a> below.)</p><p>The rationale for the use of early oral DAPT is that platelet adhesion and aggregation are early steps in the formation of occlusive coronary artery thrombus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of platelets in coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)

Many of these patients have multiple significant comorbidities, making them at high risk for bleeding complications. For patients in whom ticagrelor cannot be used, we suggest using clopidogrel.

The principal analysis was limited to the randomized trials, in which 75 percent of patients had NSTEACS.

PCI was performed at a mean time of 4.3 hours after the initial loading dose. The trial was stopped early because of the finding of harm. At seven days, the rate of the primary composite efficacy end point (death from cardiovascular causes, MI, stroke, urgent revascularization, or glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitor rescue therapy) was similar in the two groups (10.0 versus 9.9 percent, respectively; hazard ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.84-1.25).

When switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel, there is no prior occupation of the thienopyridine site and thus a concern that loading is necessary. Since prasugrel has blocked the central binding site, the switch to clopidogrel is aimed at maintaining that inhibition and thus we believe that loading with clopidogrel may not be necessary.</p><p>Pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> has a relatively rapid offset of action. At 24 hours after the last dose of ticagrelor, approximately 50 percent of its effect (inhibition of platelet aggregation) is lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. At a minimum, this suggests that the first dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> should be given as soon as 12 hours after the last dose of ticagrelor in order to maintain antiplatelet effect. The CAPITAL OPTI-CROSS study investigated the pharmacodynamic effects of switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel with or without a loading dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Sixty MI patients (39 with STEMI and 21 with NSTEMI) who were initially treated with ticagrelor and who then needed to be switched to clopidogrel were randomly assigned to a 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel followed by 75 mg daily or to 75 mg daily (no loading dose) starting 12 hours after the last ticagrelor dose. Although there was no difference between the two strategies in the primary outcome of P2Y<sub>12 </sub>reactivity units (a measure of platelet inhibition) at 72 hours (166 versus 184), PRUs were significantly lower in the loading dose arm at 48 hours (114 versus 166). A lower PRU is associated with greater drug effect, both in terms of efficacy and risk of bleeding.</p><p>The anti-ischemic benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a>, compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, is greatest early after an ACS while the risk of important clinical bleeding due to their more potent antiplatelet effect occurs during chronic treatment. Thus, there is a rationale to consider step down or de-escalation of antiplatelet therapy from a potent P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker to clopidogrel after some period of maintenance therapy. We do not believe there is sufficient evidence to recommend routinely switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel. A role for platelet function testing (PFT) to help determine which patients can be successfully switched has been hypothesized but not established. The use of PFT to determine the efficacy of clopidogrel&rsquo;s effect is discussed separately. </p><p>The TROPICAL-ACS trial attempted to address the issue of whether switching from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> is a reasonable strategy in ACS patients who had undergone successful PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In this study, 2610 ACS (45 percent NSTEMI) patients with successful PCI and who were receiving dual antiplatelet therapy planned for 12 months were randomly assigned to prasugrel for 12 months (control group) or one week of prasugrel followed by one week of clopidogrel and then PFT-guided maintenance therapy with clopidogrel or prasugrel from day 14 after hospital discharge (guided de-escalation group). Patients on clopidogrel with high platelet reactivity with insufficient platelet inhibition were switched back to prasugrel. </p><p>In TROPICAL-ACS, the one-year, net clinical end point (cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or bleeding grade 2 or higher according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC]) criteria) occurred in 7 percent of patients in the guided de-escalation group and 9 percent in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.62&ndash;1.06). This study demonstrated a similar combined risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in the de-escalation group (3 versus 3 percent) and BARC 2 or higher bleeding events (5 versus 6 percent in the control group [HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.59&ndash;1.13)]). </p><p>The investigators suggested that early de-escalation of antiplatelet treatment can be considered as an alternative approach in patients with ACS managed with PCI in whom dual antiplatelet therapy is planned for 12 months. We believe that the results of the study should be tempered by its relatively small size, which led to a small number of ischemic events (74) and the fact that a PFT-guided antiplatelet therapy strategy is not well accepted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556518884\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important common side effect associated with platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker therapy is bleeding.
