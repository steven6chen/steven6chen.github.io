Young children and toddlers are at risk for tibial shaft fractures, even when the force of injury is low. The diagnosis should be suspected in all children with a limp or refusal to bear weight.</p><p>Physical examination often allows localization of the fracture and should identify the presence of an open fracture or an acute compartment syndrome. Plain radiographs often suffice when assessing acute tibial injuries in children, but selected patients may require other forms of imaging. In patients with closed fractures and no sign of neurovascular compromise, initial management focuses on pain management, immobilization of the fracture, and reduction of swelling.</p><p>An overview of tibial fractures in children is presented here. The evaluation and management of specific types of tibial fractures in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal tibial fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tibial and fibular shaft fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tibial fractures occur commonly in children. The mechanism of injury varies depending on the age of the patient. Low energy falls and twisting injuries account for most fractures in toddlers and younger children. High energy motor vehicle accidents and sports related injuries predominate in older children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72158\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72158 \">image 1</a>). The high energy transmitted to the soft tissues surrounding the bone is relevant because of the risk for compartment syndrome associated with tibial fractures. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute compartment syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>Most tibial shaft fractures are short oblique or transverse fractures of the middle or distal third of the shaft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Tibial shaft fractures are associated with fibula fractures in 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Displaced fractures through the proximal tibial physis or metaphysis are relatively rare. With a significant hyperextension injury, posterior displacement of the proximal tibial shaft can disrupt the popliteal artery and cause distal ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Tibial tubercle fractures are more common in adolescent patients and often require operative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tibia is the major weight-bearing bone of the lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a>). The tibial shaft bridges the tibial plateau, the proximal portion of the tibia forming the base of the knee joint, and the distal tibia, comprising the superior articular surface of the ankle joint at the tibiotalar articulation and the medial malleolus.</p><p>The tibial tuberosity is a key landmark that is located 1 to 2 cm below the joint line and serves as the attachment site for the patellar tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In active older children and young adolescents, it is subject to tensile forces that may lead to chronic inflammation and pain in this apophysis called Osgood-Schlatter disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In children, both the tibia and fibula consist of a long portion of bone (the diaphysis) with growth plates at either end (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444 \">figure 1</a>). The distal physes, particularly of the fibula, are areas vulnerable to fracture when subjected to inversion and eversion stresses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-fractures-in-children#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Distal fibula fractures'</a>.)</p><p>A strong fibrous structure, the interosseous membrane connects the tibia and fibula along the length of the two bones. Proximally, this structure, reinforced by strong anterior and posterior ligaments, forms a synovial joint, the proximal tibiofibular articulation. Distally the interosseous membrane and three ligaments (the anterior, posterior, and transverse tibiofibular ligaments) stabilize the superior ankle joint.</p><p>Another fibrous structure, the crural fascia, surrounds the bones and muscles of the lower leg. Fascial extensions and the interosseous membrane separate the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the lower leg into four distinct compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 2</a>). Three of these (the anterior, posterior, and deep posterior compartments) border the tibia, but all of the compartments can be compromised by tibial injury.</p><p>Nerves and vessels lie within the anterior and the deep posterior compartments, while the lateral compartment contains the superficial peroneal nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 2</a>). Trauma that causes significant swelling in these compartments can result in neurovascular compromise. The key blood supply of the tibia arises from periosteal vessels and the nutrient artery. The nutrient artery originates from the posterior tibial artery and enters the posterolateral cortex at the middle third of the tibial shaft near the origin of the soleus muscle. Fractures in this region may compromise this blood supply.</p><p>The periosteal vessels provide a less vulnerable circulation as they derive an abundant blood supply from the anterior tibial artery, which travels down along the interosseous membrane. Vascular compromise can arise more proximally from marked effusion of the knee joint or trauma that affects the popliteal artery before it branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. Ischemia may also result from impingement of the anterior tibial artery as it branches off the popliteal artery and passes through a gap in the interosseous membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The tibial nerve and its branches (posterior tibial and common peroneal) provide the key innervation to the muscles of the lower leg and foot. Nerve roots arise from L4 through S3. The posterior tibial nerve parallels the course of the posterior tibial artery and courses through the deep posterior compartment. In the popliteal space, branches of the tibial nerve provide innervation to the posterior compartment and to the popliteus muscle. The common peroneal nerve divides into deep and superficial branches as it courses around the fibular neck. The deep peroneal nerve branches and follows the course of the anterior tibial artery providing innervation to muscles in the anterior lower leg. The superficial peroneal nerve is purely sensory and supplies sensation to the dorsum of the foot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with a suspected tibial fracture should undergo evaluation and management appropriate to the patient's mechanism of injury and physical findings. The clinician should evaluate unstable patients and those with a high risk trauma mechanism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 1</a>) according to the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with tibial fractures typically present with limp, pain, refusal to bear weight, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deformity of the lower extremity. Sports injuries and motor vehicle collisions are common causes of injury in older children and adolescents.</p><p>Isolated fractures of the tibia are common in toddlers and often result from low energy falls. However, the clinician should ensure that the mechanism of injury matches the severity of the fracture and perform a complete physical examination that searches for other physical signs of child abuse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109402 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete evaluation of the entire lower extremity should be conducted before assuming that the injury is confined to the tibia, especially in a child who is less than five years of age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> is nonverbal.</p><p>Once other injuries are excluded, the examination can focus on the tibia. Analgesia prior to examination (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> maximum dose 800 mg for mild pain or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> 0.1 to 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> maximum single dose: 10 mg for moderate or severe pain) will often facilitate the child's cooperation. We suggest that the clinician avoid oral medications for patients likely to require sedation or general anesthesia for reduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should inspect the injured lower leg for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deformity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lacerations or other open wounds suggesting an open fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tense swelling of the skin and muscles possibly indicating acute compartment syndrome</p><p/><p>The amount of swelling is not always a reliable guide to the presence of a tibial fracture, especially a toddler's fracture or stress fracture.

Bleeding from a tibial fracture can extravasate into the posterior, deep posterior, or anterior compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 2</a>) and elevate the intracompartmental pressure. Involvement of the lateral compartment usually suggests that a fibular injury is also present.

Compartment pressure measurement typically helps guide further care. Fasciotomy constitutes definitive treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs typically suffice when assessing acute tibial injuries in children and include anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral views. These should incorporate the entire length of the lower leg from knee to ankle. Radiolucent splinting during the procedure reduces the risk of additional injury and allows proper positioning to best visualize fractures.</p><p>Although the AP view is the best view for observing non-displaced spiral fractures commonly located in the distal tibia in toddlers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a>), oblique views of the tibia may aid in diagnosis when the AP and lateral plain radiographs are not revealing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In children, both the tibia and fibula consist of a long portion of bone (the diaphysis) with growth plates at either end (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with tibial fractures typically present with limp, pain, refusal to bear weight, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deformity of the lower extremity. Sports injuries and motor vehicle collisions are common mechanisms of injury in older children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72158\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72158 \">image 1</a>). Low energy falls and twisting injuries account for most fractures in toddlers and younger children.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs typically suffice when assessing acute tibial injuries in children and include anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral views. These should incorporate the entire length of the lower leg from knee to ankle.
