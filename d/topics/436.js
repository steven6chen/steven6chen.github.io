A review of publications on ovarian cancer during pregnancy from 1958 to 2007 included 41 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The mean age at presentation was 32.6 years (range 23 to 46 years); stage at diagnosis was recorded in 39 cases: Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (FIGO) I (59 percent), FIGO II (5 percent), FIGO III (26 percent), and FIGO IV (10 percent). It is important to remember that the use of obstetrical ultrasound and cesarean delivery were much less common in the initial decades of this interval, thus there was less opportunity for incidental detection of asymptomatic adnexal masses.</p><p>In a population-based hospital registry series of malignancies identified during pregnancy using birth records linked to hospital discharge data (1992 to 1997), ovarian cancer was the fifth most common cancer diagnosed during pregnancy after breast, thyroid, cervical cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. In a separate publication using this same population-based hospital registry database, there were 87 ovarian cancers diagnosed among 9375 ovarian masses diagnosed during pregnancy (malignancy rate 0.93 percent) and 0.018 ovarian cancers diagnosed per 1000 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There was also a high proportion of tumors of low malignant potential (n = 115) reported separately, with the majority in early stage and associated with favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes. A retrospective review reported that ovarian cancer was the sixth most common cancer in an Asian population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the widespread use of ultrasound, most adnexal masses in pregnant women remained unrecognized until cesarean delivery or until they became symptomatic, usually in the postpartum period. Now many asymptomatic masses are recognized in the first half of pregnancy when they are identified incidentally during an antenatal ultrasound performed for obstetrical indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,7,8</a>]. Adnexal masses that have not been diagnosed antepartum may be identified at cesarean delivery. In a retrospective study of over 46,500 term cesarean deliveries performed for obstetrical indications, 151 women (0.3 percent) underwent concurrent surgery of an adnexal mass, which was an incidental finding at surgery in just over half of the women (83 of 151; 55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Other clinical presentations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonspecific symptoms</strong> &ndash; Symptoms and signs that precede the diagnosis of ovarian cancer include abdominal or back pain, constipation, abdominal swelling, and urinary symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Since these symptoms are almost universally present in normal pregnancies, their presence is unlikely to trigger a diagnostic evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palpable mass</strong> &ndash; In some women, a suspicious finding, such as a palpable adnexal mass or posterior cul-de-sac mass or nodularity, may be identified during a routine antenatal physical examination and subsequently evaluated by ultrasound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute abdominal pain</strong> &ndash; In a few patients, acute abdominal pain due to torsion of the adnexa prompts the diagnostic evaluation. Adnexal torsion occurs in about 5 percent of pregnant women with an adnexal mass (benign or malignant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one review, adnexal masses between 6 and 8 cm in diameter had a significantly higher rate of torsion (22 percent) than either smaller or larger masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Sixty percent of the torsions occurred between the 10th and 17th week of gestation; only 6 percent occurred after 20 weeks.

An unexplained elevation in these maternal serum analytes, obtained while screening for neural tube defects or Down syndrome, may be the first sign of one of these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H514905278\" class=\"local\">'Tumor markers in ovarian malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ADNEXAL MASSES IN PREGNANT WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a review of seven studies, there were 563 adnexal masses in 557 women. Of these, 48 percent were classified as simple and 53 percent as complex. Among the simple masses, 1 percent were malignant whereas in the complex masses, 9 percent were malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another retrospective study of 151 women who underwent surgery of an adnexal mass at cesarean delivery, the adnexal mass was benign in 148 cases. Histopathologies accounting for over 4 percent of cases in the series included dermoid (24 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">paratubal/paraovarian</span> (19 percent), simple serous (15 percent), mucinous cystadenoma (11 percent), serous cystadenoma (7 percent), corpus luteum (5 percent), endometrioma (5 percent), and fibroma (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The three malignancies in the series consisted of two granulosa cell tumors and one mucinous carcinoma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign neoplasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most adnexal masses identified in pregnant women are benign simple cysts less than 5 cm in diameter. Most of these are functional ovarian cysts, either follicular or corpus luteum cysts, that occur as part of the normal physiological function of the ovary. Approximately 70 percent of all adnexal cystic masses detected in the first trimester spontaneously resolve by the early part of the second trimester, which is consistent with the natural history of functional cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of persistent adnexal masses 5 cm or greater in diameter are mature teratomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass is reviewed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass&quot;</a>). Briefly, benign adnexal masses are characterized by their ultrasonographic appearance and, in some cases, associated clinical findings (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign masses without complex features on ultrasound are generally <span class=\"nowrap\">physiologic/functional</span> cysts (eg, follicular cysts), but may be unilocular serous or mucinous cystadenoma or hydrosalpinx. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign masses with complex features on ultrasound include corpus luteum, mature teratomas, hydrosalpinx with septation, theca lutein cysts, endometriomas, multilocular cystadenomas, as well as extrauterine pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The corpus luteum persists longer during pregnancy and thus is likely to reach a larger size and may become hemorrhagic, rupture, or undergo torsion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Theca lutein cysts (also called lutein cysts, hyperreactio luteinalis) are luteinized follicle cysts that form as a result of overstimulation from high human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels or hypersensitivity to hCG. Bilateral multiseptated cystic adnexal masses in a woman with gestational trophoblastic disease, multiple gestation, ovulation induction, or a pregnancy complicated by fetal hydrops are likely to represent theca lutein cysts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A luteoma is an uncommon solid benign lesion specific to pregnancy. It is a non-neoplastic ovarian change associated with pregnancy that can simulate a neoplasm on clinical, gross, or microscopic examination. The diagnosis should be suspected when a solid adnexal mass is associated with maternal hirsutism or virilization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncomplicated pedunculated leiomyomas are usually hypoechoic compared with normal myometrium, but may have a complex appearance when there is necrosis or degeneration.</p><p/><p>The presence of pain should suggest the possibility of heterotopic pregnancy, torsion or rupture of an ovarian neoplasm, or degeneration of a leiomyoma.

Most germ cell tumors are grossly limited to one adnexa, but lymphatic spread to pelvic or para-aortic nodes occurs, most commonly in dysgerminoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Dysgerminomas are bilateral in 10 to 15 percent of cases; other germ cell tumors are almost always unilateral.

Most of these tumors are limited to one ovary at the time of diagnosis. Prior to the routine use of prenatal ultrasound, about 20 percent of these lesions presented with intraperitoneal hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemorrhagic shock, but this has become less common with earlier diagnosis.</p><p>Between 10 and 15 percent of stromal tumors secrete androgens and produce virilization. Although estrogen secretion also occurs, symptoms of a hyperestrogenic state are masked by the already high estrogen concentration associated with pregnancy.</p><p>Pregnancy-related histologic changes in these tumors include a disorderly arrangement of cells, increased edema, and unusually large numbers of lutein or Leydig cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary: Granulosa-stromal cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189801094\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive diagnosis can only be made by resecting the ovarian neoplasm for pathologic examination. However, some benign ovarian masses, including follicular or corpus luteal cysts, endometriomas, and mature teratomas (dermoid), have characteristic sonographic features, and the diagnosis is reasonably certain without surgical exploration. </p><p>It is important that ovarian tissue is examined by a pathologist skilled in interpretation of histologic findings in the context of an ongoing pregnancy and that the pathologist is informed of the coexistent pregnancy. Pregnancy-related changes in the histologic appearance of tumors of low malignant potential can result in atypical characteristics suggestive of invasive cancer. In one series, 8 of 10 serous neoplasms diagnosed in pregnancy had microscopic and clinical features suggesting aggressive behavior; however, all of these features regressed postpartum in this small series, confirming that the neoplasms were of low malignant potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H514904646\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189801839\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection for surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general consensus regarding management of adnexal masses in pregnancy is to surgically resect asymptomatic masses that are present after the first trimester and (1) are &gt;10 cm in diameter or (2) are solid or contain solid and cystic areas or have papillary areas or septae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,2,12,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,12,19-22</a>]. The rationale for this approach is that these findings increase the likelihood of malignancy, and it is desirable to diagnose malignancy, if present, at an early stage. In addition, resection of large adnexal masses (benign or malignant) reduces the risk of complications such as adnexal torsion, rupture, or obstruction of labor. Emergency surgery during pregnancy for management of a torsed or ruptured adnexal mass is uncommon (&lt;5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23</a>]) and can lead to preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/19,20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,24</a>].</p><p>Adnexal masses that do not have concerning features (eg, persistence into the second trimester, large size, or solid components) are likely to be physiologic cysts and can be managed expectantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25-31</a>], and often resolve during pregnancy. Expectant management is also appropriate for cysts with these features if the sonographer is reasonably certain that the neoplasm is a follicular or corpus luteal cyst, endometrioma, or mature teratoma. Surgical treatment of endometriomas depends upon whether the patient is symptomatic. Most mature teratomas are benign, but surgery may be indicated postpartum to prevent torsion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Mature teratoma (dermoid)'</a>). For any ovarian mass, if the diagnosis is uncertain, further evaluation is required. Up to 10 percent of adnexal masses that persist during pregnancy are malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,26,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26,32</a>]. A substantial portion of these are epithelial low malignant potential tumors or germ cell tumors, both tumors with a typically favorable prognosis.

If the ultrasound findings cannot distinguish between a possible pedunculated or degenerating leiomyoma and an ovarian neoplasm, we suggest obtaining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The more precise diagnosis afforded by MRI may allow the clinician to cancel planned exploratory surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A routine preoperative chest radiograph is unnecessary; however, if the history and physical examination suggest pulmonary disease, then a chest radiograph should be obtained with shielding of the <span class=\"nowrap\">abdomen/pelvis</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H514905845\"><span class=\"h3\">Secondary imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, ultrasound examination provides sufficient information to guide a decision for exploratory surgery versus conservative management, but occasionally, further radiologic evaluation is required. MRI has excellent resolution for soft tissue pathology and does not expose the patient (or fetus) to ionizing radiation. Therefore, MRI is particularly useful in characterizing a pedunculated leiomyoma, red degeneration of leiomyomas, endometriomas, decidualized endometriomas, and massive ovarian edema and distinguishing these lesions from ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Gadolinium-based contrast material should generally be avoided in pregnancy because fetal safety has not been established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Iodinated contrast materials'</a>.)</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) is avoided in pregnant women if other imaging methods can provide the needed information. The fetal ionizing radiation dose for a single CT through the pelvis is 0.035 Gy. Although fetal radiation exposure of less than 0.05 Gy has not been associated with an increased risk of abortion, congenital anomalies, growth restriction, or perinatal mortality, there remain concerns regarding a possible increase in the risk of developing childhood cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In addition, the use of iodinated contrast agents with CT carries a risk of transient suppression of the fetal thyroid.

Pregnancy-associated pelvic masses are infrequently malignant, and the interpretation of these tumor markers varies with gestational age and comorbid conditions. If a malignancy is proven, then appropriate tumor markers may be drawn in the immediate postoperative period. </p><p>Several of the tumor markers used to follow epithelial and nonepithelial ovarian cancers in nonpregnant women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55817 \">table 1</a>) are difficult to interpret in pregnancy because oncofetal antigens (eg, alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], cancer antigen 125 [CA 125]) are involved in biological functions associated with fetal development, differentiation, and maturation. The levels are normally elevated during gestation and fluctuate with gestational age, or they may be abnormally elevated due to abnormal placentation or fetal abnormalities (eg, preeclampsia, Down syndrome, open neural tube defect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H514905333\"><span class=\"h4\">Serum CA 125</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum levels of CA 125 are elevated in most cases of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). CA 125 is also produced by normal tissues, including endometrium, and may be elevated during early gestation and immediately following delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81621 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, CA 125 may be helpful as a tumor marker of EOC between 15 weeks of gestation and delivery, as serum values at this time are unlikely to be markedly elevated solely as a consequence of pregnancy. A CA 125 in the range of 1000 to 10,000 is likely (but not invariably) related to cancer, but values in the range of 75 to 150 could be either pregnancy-related or due to an ovarian cancer that does not demonstrate high expression of CA 125. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H514905339\"><span class=\"h4\">Alpha-fetoprotein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal serum levels of AFP (MSAFP) normally rise during pregnancy; serum levels are routinely assayed as part of the screen for fetal neural tube defects and Down syndrome.

The vertical midline incision should be adequate to minimize the need to manipulate the gravid uterus while obtaining exposure to the adnexal mass. If there is a low risk of malignancy, a minimally invasive approach is reasonable and can be performed at all stages of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, as with other types of surgery performed during pregnancy, the optimal time to operate is the early second trimester.

The opposite adnexa should be carefully inspected and palpated for a contralateral adnexal mass. Contralateral ovarian biopsy is recommended if the ovary appears to be involved, but routine biopsy or wedge resection of a normal-appearing contralateral ovary is unwarranted.</p><p>The most common findings at surgery are persistent corpus luteal functional cysts, benign dermoid cysts, and serous or mucinous cystadenomas. If the preoperative imaging and intraoperative gross findings are both consistent with a benign diagnosis, it is reasonable to attempt a cystectomy rather than perform a salpingo-oophorectomy. If the mass is larger than 10 cm, it may not be technically feasible to perform an ovarian cystectomy. If the mass is solid, has surface excrescences, is associated with ascites, or has other features suggesting malignancy, then ipsilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is appropriate. The mass should be sent for frozen section and the pathologist informed of the concurrent pregnancy. Resection of the contralateral ovary should not be performed unless bilateral disease is identified; this decision must await the frozen section analysis. All suspicious lesions should be biopsied.</p><p>If the pathologist confirms a malignant tumor at frozen section, the surgeon should be prepared to complete an adequate surgical staging procedure, and a gynecologic oncologist should be consulted. The general principles of the staging procedure for a malignant ovarian tumor are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75194 \">table 3</a>) and in detail separately. Obviously, hysterectomy is not performed if preservation of the pregnancy is desired, and the surgeon must individualize each case, weighing the pros and cons of staging versus potential risk to the mother and fetus. In certain malignant germ cell tumors of the ovary (eg, endodermal sinus tumors), lymph node dissection may be omitted, as the patient will require chemotherapy based on the histopathology alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Adequate surgical staging is of particular importance for stage I cancers (ie, those that are limited to the ovary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 4</a>)), as many, but not all, of these neoplasms are adequately treated with surgery alone. In such cases, the need for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is determined by the histologic tumor type. Surgical staging (eg, sampling of lymph nodes) is less critical in the setting of obvious advanced disease (eg, stage <span class=\"nowrap\">IIIB/C</span> disease), as these tumors (with the exception of tumors of low malignant potential) will require chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy of ovarian cancer in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of malignant germ cell tumors of the ovary&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary: Granulosa-stromal cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a metastatic ovarian cancer is identified, cytoreduction should be attempted. The extent of surgical cytoreduction involves individual judgment, balancing the extent of surgery with the expected benefit. It is rare that removal of the gravid uterus is required for maximal cytoreductive surgery at the initial surgery because it is possible, if necessary, to return for secondary cytoreduction following chemotherapy and successful completion of the pregnancy. This management strategy is not thought to adversely impact survival, although as a general rule, survival is poor for women who have late-stage disease.</p><p>Despite the importance of early surgical debulking to outcomes in ovarian cancer, the surgeon should keep in mind the sensitivity of these tumors to platinum-based chemotherapy when aggressive resection of metastatic disease is considered. With modern platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, approximately 70 percent of patients who present with advanced disease will respond to chemotherapy, even if they have residual disease remaining after cytoreductive surgery. </p><p>The hazard of overly aggressive surgery and delay in starting chemotherapy can be illustrated by a case report of a patient with a yolk sac tumor that was resected at 19 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adnexal-mass-in-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Chemotherapy was delayed because of the pregnancy and at 32 weeks of gestation, tumor recurrence necessitated a cesarean-hysterectomy and bowel resection with colostomy. Three weeks later, the colostomy was taken down and another suprahepatic tumor mass was resected. The patient was then given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (BEP) for four cycles, but the course was complicated by a fecal fistula that developed at the colostomy site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy of ovarian cancer in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer diagnosed before delivery, hysterectomy and secondary cytoreductive surgery are reasonable postpartum to remove persistent disease. This surgery can be performed following vaginal delivery or in conjunction with cesarean delivery.

If the corpus luteum is removed prior to eight weeks, progesterone supplementation should be given as a 50 to 100 mg vaginal suppository every 8 to 12 hours or as a daily intramuscular injection of 1 mL (50 mg) progesterone in oil.

In these cases, if frozen section indicates malignancy, salpingo-oophorectomy is performed and postpartum, the patient is referred to a gynecologic oncologist for counseling, staging, and possible hysterectomy within the next one to two weeks.</p><p>If an adnexal mass suspicious for malignancy is detected antepartum, the patient should be counseled and consented appropriately. Cesarean delivery should be performed through a midline incision, and a gynecologic oncologist should be available, if required.
