This can cause confusion and other symptoms.</p><p>Shock is a life-threatening condition. A person in shock needs treatment right away. Without treatment, the organs in the body will stop working. This causes death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28464832\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of shock?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms depend on the cause of the shock and how severe it is. The main symptoms of shock include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low blood pressure &ndash; If you take the person's pulse, it might feel weak.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast heart rate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting differently from normal. This can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acting confused &ndash; A person in shock might have trouble paying attention to instructions, or not realize where he or she is.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not responding when someone talks to them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cool clammy skin or red, flushed skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating much less than usual</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28464847\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, as soon as possible. Many people who are in shock are already in a hospital. If you are not in a hospital, you or someone with you should call the doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have an injury or infection and any of the main symptoms of shock.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had a recent surgery or hospital stay, and now are sick or have an infection.</p><p/><p>If your doctor or nurse cannot see you right away, or you cannot reach him or her, go to the nearest emergency room. If you have a serious injury, such as a broken leg or bleeding wound, <strong>call for an ambulance right away (dial 9-1-1 in the US and Canada)</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28464862\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do tests to find the cause of the shock. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as X-rays, CT scans, or ultrasound &ndash; These imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart tests &ndash; These can include a test called an &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; or &quot;ECG&quot; and a test called an &quot;echocardiogram.&quot; These tests can show heart problems that could cause shock.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28464879\"><span class=\"h1\">How is shock treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for shock depends on the cause. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments to stop bleeding &ndash; If the shock is caused by bleeding, doctors and nurses can put pressure on the area that is bleeding or sew it up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids that go into a vein through a thin tube called an &quot;IV&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood transfusion &ndash; This is when a person gets blood that was donated by someone else. The blood goes into a vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments to get rid of fluid, air, or blood in the belly or around the heart or lungs &ndash; Doctors can use a thin needle to take it out, or do surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency surgery &ndash; This can treat injuries that cause shock.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics that go into a vein through an IV &ndash; This can treat infections that cause shock.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroids that go into a vein through an IV &ndash; These can treat allergies that can cause shock. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines to treat allergies, for example, if shock is caused by a serious allergy to bee stings or a food</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to increase blood pressure while doctors treat the cause of shock</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28464894\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sepsis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gi-bleed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: GI bleed (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
