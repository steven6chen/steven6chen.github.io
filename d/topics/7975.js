Several terms, including posterior thigh injury, hamstring strain, hamstring tendinopathy, and hamstring tear, are used to describe such injuries, but they are not always synonymous. In most cases, the severity of the injury determines treatment and the amount of time the athlete must take off from sport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>].</p><p>For the purpose of this review, we will define hamstring injury as any strain or tear, including avulsion, of any of the muscles or tendons within the hamstring group, including the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles.</p><p>The diagnosis, management, risk factors, and prevention of hamstring muscle and tendon injuries are reviewed here. Other musculoskeletal injuries of the lower extremity are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-sprain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle sprain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23894877\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of hamstring injuries among athletes varies based upon the definition used. Nevertheless, most researchers agree that hamstring injuries comprise a substantial percentage of acute, sports-related musculoskeletal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Prevalence ranges from 8 to 25 percent, depending upon the sport. The timing for return to sport ranges from as early as two weeks to never, depending upon injury severity and the sport in question. One observational study reports a single-season prevalence rate greater than 50 percent among elite soccer players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Recurrent hamstring injuries develop in more than 30 percent of athletes, with most occurring during the ensuing sporting season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/4,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,8</a>].</p><p>Data collected from the United States&rsquo; National Collegiate Athletic Association indicates that the three highest risk sports are American football and men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s soccer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The overall rate of hamstring injury was 3.05 per 10,000 sport exposures.&nbsp;The risk was about twice as high during competition and preseason training compared to general practice.&nbsp;In this database, 12.6 percent of injuries were recurrent strains and 6.3 percent were severe enough to cause the athlete to miss three or more weeks of sport.</p><p>A 13-year longitudinal analysis of elite soccer athletes in Europe clarifies the injury burden in that sport. The overall rate of injury was 1.2 per 1000 hours. Injuries in games occurred at nine times the frequency of practice. On average 21.8 percent of players experienced an injury during a season. The average time loss was 19.7 days per 1000 hours with a mean loss of 17 days per injury. Hamstring remained the most common injury in elite soccer and in spite of known preventive measures appeared to be increasing in frequency over the study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1615166\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hamstring is composed of three muscles in the posterior thigh: the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73719\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73719 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53747\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53747 \">figure 1</a>). The long head of the biceps femoris originates at the ischial tuberosity, while the short head originates from the femoral shaft; both insert at the fibular head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101405\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101405 \">figure 2</a>). The semitendinosus and semimembranosus both originate from the ischial tuberosity and insert at the medial tibia in the pes anserine region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101407 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101406\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101406 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>An understanding of the anatomy of the posterior hip region, thigh muscles, and adjacent nerves and vascular structures is important when considering the differential diagnosis of posterior thigh pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As an example, the sciatic nerve's location adjacent to the hamstrings can lead to radicular symptoms following some hamstring muscle injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23894975\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The primary actions of the hamstring muscles are knee flexion and hip extension. In addition, the biceps femoris contributes to external rotation of the hip, while the semitendinosus and semimembranosus contribute to internal rotation.</p><p>From a functional standpoint, the hamstring's key role is in deceleration during walking, running, and cutting (ie, making acute changes of direction at high speed). This deceleration is accomplished by eccentric muscle contraction (ie, contraction while the muscle lengthens). The hamstring muscles decelerate the lower limb during the forward swing phase of running, before the hip is extended to achieve forward motion. This braking function is also critical in kicking movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/6,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21,22</a>].</p><p>During locomotion, the hamstring muscle group must act in coordinated fashion with the other muscles involved in extension, flexion, and stabilization of the knee and hip. Injury to any of the muscles involved in locomotion is likely to have ramifications elsewhere.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56671346\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF HAMSTRING INJURY AND GRADING SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hamstring injuries traditionally have been classified as mild (Grade I), moderate (Grade II), or severe (Grade III). Grade I injuries signify a small disruption of the structural integrity of the musculotendinous unit with minor swelling and pain and no, or minimal, strength loss. Grade II strains are partial tears with some intact musculotendinous fibers, pain is present, and there is a definite loss of strength. Grade III tears involve complete tears of the musculotendinous unit with complete loss of muscle function and are typically accompanied by a large hematoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23894884\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2453276\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide range of potential risk factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable, contribute to hamstring injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/1,2,5,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,23,24</a>]. Sport-specific risk factors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H23894891\" class=\"local\">'Sport-specific risks'</a> below.)</p><p>Few large prospective studies addressing potential risk factors for hamstring injury or the best methods for reducing the risk of injury have been performed; as a result, any discussion is necessarily limited. According to one statistical model, approximately 20 to 50 injuries are needed to determine accurately whether a risk factor is strongly associated with hamstring injury, and 200 or more injuries are needed to assess risk factors with small to moderate associations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Modifiable risk factors may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate warm-up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased training volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hamstring inflexibility </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hamstring weakness (may be weakness relative to ipsilateral quadriceps or contralateral hamstring)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cross-pelvic posture (ie, lumbar lordosis with anterior pelvic tilt) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100726\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100726 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89722 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar-pelvic weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor biomechanics (eg, running or change of direction)</p><p/><p>Non-modifiable risk factors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous hamstring or lower extremity muscle injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>African or Aboriginal ethnic origin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2453283\"><span class=\"h2\">Previous injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A previous hamstring injury is the most frequently noted risk factor for subsequent injury. Most studies showing this association involve Australian Rules football and report that athletes with a previous hamstring injury were two to six times more likely to suffer recurrent strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/5,24,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24,26-30</a>]. While most subsequent injuries occur within the first two months after return to sport, increased risk persists thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/26,27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27,31</a>]. In some studies, the risk was three times that of an uninjured athlete up to one year or longer following the initial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The increased risk associated with previous injury is due in part to the weakness of the muscle during healing which, according to some laboratory and clinical studies, requires up to nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, debate persists about the relative importance of inadequate rehabilitation and premature return to sport and the role of permanent tissue damage created by the initial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/6,26,29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,26,29,32,33</a>]. Some researchers believe that skeletal muscles are at risk for reinjury because of scar tissue formation and changes in the muscular architecture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>], but others dispute this contention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The association between the severity of the initial injury (defined in some studies by the number of days missed from competition) and recurrence during the same season is unclear. Some studies report no relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], while others found a high risk of recurrence within two seasons in athletes with severe strains (&gt;18 days missed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. According to three prospective cohort studies, injury size (as determined by magnetic resonance imaging) did not clearly identify individuals at risk for reinjury, but did correlate with rehabilitation time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. This suggests that premature return to sport increases the risk of reinjury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2453290\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle inflexibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited hamstring flexibility may increase the risk of injuring these muscles. However, studies both supporting and contradicting this assertion have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/7,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,38</a>]. Adding to the confusion are the problems inherent in interpreting studies of muscle flexibility. Measuring hamstring flexibility can be difficult, since motion occurs at both the hamstring and the lumbo-pelvic junction, and many athletes participate in regular stretching routines and demonstrate good flexibility at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Hamstring flexibility may be less important than the flexibility of the quadriceps muscles (the antagonists of the hamstrings) and hip flexor muscles in determining the risk of hamstring injury. One prospective study reported an inverse relationship between increased quadriceps flexibility and the incidence of hamstring strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Athletes able to achieve greater than approximately 50 degrees of knee flexion (using a modified Thomas test) were less likely to suffer a hamstring strain. In the same study, hip flexor tightness posed a significant risk for hamstring injury, although the older-aged athletes in this subgroup may have confounded the results.</p><p>One reason why tight hip flexor muscles may predispose athletes to hamstring injury is the higher potential energy this tightness creates when the hip is extended and the knee flexed during the pre-swing phase of running [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This energy generates greater forward propulsion of the leg from the passive recoil of these muscles during the subsequent swing phase. The more forceful propulsion increases the load on the hamstrings as they decelerate the leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2453304\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substantial hamstring weakness relative to the contralateral hamstring or to the ipsilateral quadriceps, as well as absolute hamstring weakness, may increase the risk of hamstring injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. While not every study concurs, larger prospective studies support the role of relative hamstring weakness in injury susceptibility. </p><p>The findings of several observational studies suggest that substantial discrepancies in strength between hamstrings predispose to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/5,30,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,30,40,41</a>]. As an example, a prospective cohort study of 178 rugby athletes found that limb to limb differences in eccentric hamstring strength (measured during performance of eccentric (Nordic) hamstring exercise) of greater than 15 percent was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of hamstring injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A 15 percent difference led to a 2.4-fold increase in risk (95% CI 1.1-5.5), while a 20 percent difference led to a 3.4-fold increase (95% CI 1.5-7.6). Among athletes who remained uninjured, a 10 percent strength discrepancy was noted, suggesting that athletes have a dominant leg and some baseline differences in hamstring strength are common but inconsequential if not too great. In another prospective observational study involving 100 professional soccer (football) athletes, asymmetries in hamstring strength of greater than 15 percent were associated with an increased risk of non-contact hamstring muscle strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Strength imbalances between the quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups may play an important role in hamstring injury. Relative weakness of the hamstrings compared with the quadriceps in the injured leg has been noted in several observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/2,24,40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24,40,42</a>]. As described above, the hamstring muscles decelerate the leg during the swing phase of running and during kicking movements. The force of the leg swing may be greater in individuals with relatively stronger quadriceps, placing greater demands on the hamstrings during deceleration. Some researchers speculate that the quadriceps strength of many elite athletes may be too great, predisposing them to hamstring injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Strength imbalance or abnormal recruitment patterns among hamstring muscle may play a role in injury. Functional MRI study showing this correlated with repeat injury risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]<em>.</em></p><p>Absolute weakness of the hamstrings too may predispose to injury. In a prospective study of high level soccer players, those with eccentric knee flexor strength below 337 Newtons, as determined during preseason testing, were more likely to sustain a hamstring strain (n = 27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2453318\"><span class=\"h2\">Problems with related structures (kinetic chain)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries to other muscles in the affected leg may predispose to hamstring strain. This is consistent with the concept of the kinetic chain, whereby muscles act as one component in a series of interdependent musculoskeletal structures that work together to coordinate and control movement. The hamstring is an important structure in the posterior kinetic chain, a term often used to describe the inter-related structures in the back of the body involved in extending the hip and spine, among other functions.</p><p>Weakness (eg, muscle injury) or tightness in any part of a kinetic chain increases the strain placed on other components, which must compensate, thereby increasing their risk of injury. For instance, a non-hamstring injury may alter an athlete's running biomechanics, placing added stress on the hamstring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As one example, the risk of subsequent hamstring injury is increased in individuals with a history of osteitis pubis or previous injury to the calf or quadriceps muscles or knee ligaments, according to observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29</a>].</p><p>Multiple abnormalities of the posterior kinetic chain occur with a cross pelvic posture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89722 \">picture 2</a>), and preliminary research suggests that this posture increases the risk for hamstring injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The pelvic cross syndrome (also known as lower cross syndrome or cross pelvic posture) is defined by an increased lumbar lordosis and anterior tilt of the pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100726\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100726 \">figure 5</a>) and is associated with tight hip flexor (iliopsoas and rectus femoris) and lumbar extensor (lumbar erector spinae) muscles, weak hip extensor (gluteus maximus) and lumbar flexor (rectus abdominus) muscles, and sacroiliac joint dysfunction. These musculoskeletal abnormalities place added stress on the hamstring muscles during activity. Further studies are needed to determine more precisely the role of cross pelvic posture and sacroiliac joint dysfunction in hamstring strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Lumbar-pelvic weakness is another abnormality of the posterior kinetic chain that may increase the risk for hamstring muscle injury. Weakness in this region results in abnormal posture, joint malalignment, and inefficient movement patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2453311\"><span class=\"h2\">Age and other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the age ranges for athletes included in studies of hamstring injury are relatively narrow, increasing age appears to be another risk factor for hamstring injury, according to several studies of Australian footballers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/3,5,22,24,28,29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,22,24,28,29,31</a>]. Specifically, athletes older than 23 years were 1.3 to 3.9 times more likely to suffer a hamstring injury than younger players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22</a>], while athletes older than 25 years were 2.8 to 4.4 times more likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/3,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31</a>]. Data suggest that the overall risk of injury increases by 30 percent annually after the start of a professional playing career [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Different theories have been proposed to explain why hamstring injury risk increases with age. One theory suggests that aging correlates with a reduction in the hamstring muscles' cross-sectional area, which reduces the muscles capacity to generate tension and resist loads before failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the studies supporting this theory involved younger athletes, possibly with less developed musculature, and older athletes, who may already have sustained subclinical hamstring injuries, and these factors may have confounded the results. A second theory is that age-related lumbar degeneration leads to L5 and S1 nerve impingement and subsequent hamstring muscle fiber degeneration, and ultimately, hamstring injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Race and ethnicity may also be risk factors, as athletes of African or Aboriginal ethnic origin appear significantly more likely to suffer hamstring strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/21,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,29</a>]. In Australian Rules football, professional Aboriginal footballers were 11.2 times more likely to suffer hamstring strains than non-Aboriginal footballers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a study of English professional football leagues, hamstring injury was not specific to any nationality or ethnic group, but was increased in all players of &quot;black ethnic origin&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Studies of the relationship between increased weight or body mass index (BMI) and hamstring injury report inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/3,5,26,29,31,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,26,29,31,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23894891\"><span class=\"h2\">Sport-specific risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hamstring injuries are common in sports that involve high-speed running. Track and field runners and hurdlers, who combine forceful hip flexion with full knee extension during their events, are prone to hamstring injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/40,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,47,48</a>]. Participants in sports that involve rapid deceleration and acceleration, such as football (soccer), American football, and Australian Rules football, are also prone to hamstring strain.</p><p>With each of these sports, there are specific circumstances when hamstring injuries are more prevalent. As an example, playing at a higher level of competition increases the risk factor for hamstring injury. One observational study of English Premier League (EPL) soccer reported a significantly higher prevalence of hamstring strain in the first division versus the second [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A similar study of Australian Rules football found a significantly higher prevalence (&gt;20 percent) of hamstring injuries among players in the Australian Football League (AFL) compared with the less competitive South Australian National Football League (SANFL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These differences may reflect the increased physical challenges of the higher leagues, where the tempo of games may be faster and training more demanding.</p><p>Positions that require more running are associated with higher hamstring injury rates. As an example, outfield players exhibit a higher incidence (22 to 37 percent) of hamstring strain compared with goalkeepers in English football and Australian Rules football leagues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/21,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,42</a>]. A 10-year study of hamstring injuries (n = 1716) in the National Football League of the United States reported that 43.9 percent were sustained by wide receivers or defensive secondary players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Exercises involving movements of the knee and hip joints at the outer limits of their range of motion, as with ballet dancers, represent another risk factor for hamstring injuries.<sup> </sup>Sports with physical demands similar to dance demonstrate similar patterns of symptoms, hamstring injury location, and recovery time. Such hamstring injuries usually occur during movements that combine extreme hip flexion and knee extension.</p><p>A 13-year longitudinal study of over 1600 hamstring injuries among elite soccer players showed a 4 percent annual increase in hamstring injuries. Even though hamstring injuries in matches are still higher than in practice, the increased rate was due more to higher practice injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some experts speculate that a shift toward higher intensity training sessions that increase the amount of sprinting and <span class=\"nowrap\">acceleration/</span> deceleration movements account for the observed higher injury rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4095688\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4095548\"><span class=\"h2\">History and mechanism of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals with hamstring injuries present acutely complaining of the sudden onset of posterior thigh pain while performing a high-risk activity. The individual may report a pop or feel localized warmth at the site of injury. (See <a href=\"#H23894884\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Some researchers hypothesize that there are two primary mechanisms for hamstring injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/47,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50,51</a>]. These can be referred to as a running or high-speed mechanism and a stretching or low-speed mechanism; although not all stretching movement (eg, high kick) injuries occur at truly low speeds.</p><p>Classically, hamstring injury occurs during high-speed running. As noted above, the hamstrings contract eccentrically to decelerate the leg during the end of the swing phase of running (when the lower extremity is fully extended in front of the runner's body). Injury occurs when a sudden forceful eccentric contraction of the hamstring occurs against resistance (eg, concentric quadriceps contraction), overloading the muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/16,20,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20,47</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1615166\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and physiology'</a> above.)</p><p>With the low-speed mechanism, hamstring strain occurs during stretching movements with the hip and knee joints at their extreme limits of motion, forcing the hamstring beyond its elastic capacities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/10,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,47</a>]. Such injuries can occur in dancers performing movements involving forced hip flexion with simultaneous full knee extension (eg, high kick).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23894954\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of a potential hamstring injury follows the standard approach used for all musculoskeletal injuries: inspection, palpation, range of motion assessment, strength testing, and special testing. Gait abnormalities should be noted. These may include limited hip flexion on the affected side, lack of full hip extension, decreased lift in the float (ie, swing) phase of gait, or an antalgic gait (ie, limp). Inspect the leg and hip region for swelling, ecchymosis, muscular defects, and atrophy. Each of the three hamstring muscles should be palpated from origin to insertion, paying particular attention to the origin at the ischial tuberosity and to the popliteal fossa. Focal tenderness is common. (See <a href=\"#H1615166\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and physiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Range of motion can be assessed clinically with the patient prone and is easily quantified with a goniometer. We advocate assessing concentric hamstring strength starting with the knee at 90 degrees of flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74953\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74953 \">picture 3</a>) and assessing eccentric strength with the knee extended between 15 and 30 degrees (full knee extension [ie, leg straight] equals 0 degrees) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54986\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54986 \">picture 4</a>). During strength testing, greater emphasis can be placed on the biceps femoris by externally rotating the leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69764\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69764 \">picture 5</a>), while internal rotation accentuates the role of the semimembranosus and semitendinosus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78444\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78444 \">picture 6</a>). With the patient supine, assess hip range of motion and the strength of the hip flexors, extensors, abductors, and adductors.</p><p>Knee range of motion, hamstring strength, the degree of ecchymosis, and the presence or absence of palpable muscle defects all assist the physician in grading the severity of injury and creating an appropriate treatment plan. Severe injury is suggested by pain accompanied by diffuse ecchymosis, extensive swelling, palpable defects in the muscle, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> notable strength deficits compared with the uninjured hamstrings. Advanced imaging and referral to an orthopedic surgeon is needed in such cases. (See <a href=\"#H4095799\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23894996\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation'</a> below.)</p><p>If radiculopathy is present, neurologic testing and a straight leg raise test should be performed; if the injury is not clearly a hamstring tear, a complete back and hip examination is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/17-19,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19,52</a>].

As an example, one prospective observational study of 51 soccer-related hamstring injuries using ultrasound assessment reported that approximately two-thirds of injuries involved the biceps femoris while the other one-third involved the semitendinosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, numbers vary among studies and often more than one muscle is injured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/47,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,53</a>].</p><p>Proximal injuries, including tendon avulsion (which occurs proximal to the origin of the short head of the biceps femoris), are more common than distal injuries regardless of the muscle involved. Most injuries occur in the musculotendinous junction, a 10 to 12 cm transition zone in which myofibrils merge with tendon. Avulsion fractures of the ischium involving a hamstring muscle origin rarely occur in adults but may occur in skeletally immature athletes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87258\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87258 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91241\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91241 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87259\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87259 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87260\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87260 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/20,34,47,50,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,34,47,50,53</a>].</p><p>Sprinters tend to injure the long head of the biceps femoris, including the intramuscular tendon (or aponeurosis) and adjacent muscle fibers proximally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/35,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,50</a>]. This appears to be true of professional soccer players as well, according to a study of 27 hamstring strains of which 24 involved the long head of the biceps femoris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. According to one study, hamstring injuries among sprinters are often disabling initially but tend to require shorter rehabilitation compared with those sustained by dancers. The closer the injury is to the ischial tuberosity, the longer the recovery time required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Dancers and other athletes who sustain hamstring injuries via a low-speed mechanism typically strain the semimembranosus muscle and its proximal tendon. They require a longer convalescent period, likely due to the involvement of free tendon (ie, tendon without presence of myofibrils) or a bone fragment. However, within this subset of proximal injuries there appears to be no correlation between the distance of the injury from the ischial tuberosity and recovery time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/47,51,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,51,55</a>].

Both provide detailed information about the location and extent of injury.</p><p>The advantages of US include low cost and portability. In addition, US allows for dynamic assessment of the hamstring tendon, which provides information about tendon and muscle integrity at varying degrees of resisted contraction. US has greater sensitivity during the acute phase of injury when inflammatory fluid is found in the soft tissue, but sensitivity declines when scanning is delayed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91240\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91240 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91241\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91241 \">image 2</a>). As the fluid resolves (usually within two weeks), US becomes less accurate at depicting myofibrillar abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Further study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of US more precisely are needed. One limitation of US is that accuracy depends upon the skill of the ultrasonographer. US is not a useful tool for determining the time required for an athlete to return to sport, even when it accurately portrays the extent of muscular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>MRI is more reliable than US at depicting hamstring tendon and osseous avulsion injuries and injuries at the deeper musculotendinous junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F85937\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85937 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87259\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87259 \">image 3</a>). MRI allows accurate assessment of the degree of tendon retraction and of tendon edge morphology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86518\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86518 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83906\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83906 \">image 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This gives the surgeon important information, as tendon avulsion may require surgical repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87259\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87259 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/7,16-18,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16-18,56,57</a>]. In addition, MRI sensitivity does not wane over time. Some research suggests that MRI is useful for estimating time away from sport since the length and cross sectional area of the injury can be measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/35,36,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36,58</a>], but other studies suggest that baseline MRI findings add little and should not be used to determine when an athlete is ready to resume full athletic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23895031\" class=\"local\">'Return to work or sport'</a> below.)</p><p>When experienced musculoskeletal ultrasonographers are available, initial imaging should be performed with US because of its low cost and high sensitivity. However, in current clinical practice in the United States, MRI remains the imaging modality of choice when severe injuries (eg, hamstring rupture) are suspected. In studies that compare the ability of MRI and US to assess hamstring muscle volume as an indirect marker of recovery from injury, US measurement of hamstring muscle thickness appears to correlate well with MRI findings of muscle volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Imaging markers on both MRI and US can suggest a more difficult time with return to play [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. However, neither US nor MRI has shown strong efficacy for estimating recovery time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/10,62,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,62,64</a>]. </p><p>Standard radiographs may be useful in skeletally immature athletes, in whom bony avulsion injuries are more common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87258\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87258 \">image 1</a>), although even in these circumstances US may be preferable. In one study of 243 young athletes, US demonstrated greater sensitivity for avulsion injury compared with plain radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23894975\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the mechanism of injury and localization of symptoms at the time of injury makes the diagnosis of acute hamstring strain or rupture straightforward. However, in athletes with long standing pain, recurrent symptoms, or an unclear mechanism of injury, diagnosis can be more difficult. The differential diagnosis for posterior thigh pain includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Proximal thigh:</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lumbar radiculopathy &ndash; Lumbar radiculopathy may occur concurrently with a hamstring strain, complicating diagnosis, but most often develops independently. Both conditions can cause pain in the posterior thigh, but pain from lumbar radiculopathy involves the low back and often radiates below the knee. History may reveal worsening of symptoms with sitting, coughing, bending forward, or other factors that would not typically aggravate a hamstring injury but can increase neural tension. Physical examination reveals no hamstring tenderness or weakness in most cases, but may demonstrate other focal weakness related to the level of the affected nerve root, and ultrasound examination of the hamstrings is unremarkable, unless the two conditions occur together, which is uncommon. MRI of the lumbar spine reveals the cause of lumbar radiculopathy in most cases. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hamstring syndrome &ndash; Hamstring syndrome is a chronic gluteal sciatic pain in which post-traumatic scars (typically associated with recurrent hamstring injury) or congenital fibrotic bands irritate the sciatic nerve at the region of the hamstring muscles' origins around the ischial tuberosity. The condition is a potential complication of hamstring injury and is discussed below. (see <a href=\"#H15303406\" class=\"local\">'Hamstring syndrome'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adductor (groin) muscle strain &ndash; Adductor strains typically cause focal pain in the groin area or the medial thigh, either in the muscle belly of the injured adductor or proximally at its origin. Such injury typically involves an acute groin strain sustained while sprinting or performing some other explosive movement during sport involving a stretched adductor. Examination reveals pain with resisted hip adduction; hamstring examination is generally unremarkable. Ultrasound examination confirms the diagnosis in most instances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adductor-muscle-and-tendon-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adductor muscle and tendon injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Femoral neck or shaft stress fracture &ndash; Femoral stress fractures are overuse injuries typically caused by repetitive tensile or compressive stresses, as may occur in distance runners. The onset of pain is insidious. Pain initially develops only with activity and increases with impact. Eventually, pain persists with less activity or even at rest. Clinical diagnosis is suggested by a positive fulcrum test and painful hop test on the affected lower extremity; careful physical examination of the hamstring muscle is typically unremarkable, as is ultrasound examination. Plain radiographs can be diagnostic of stress fracture, but no abnormalities may be visible during the first few weeks of injury and advanced imaging (bone scan, MRI) is often needed for definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Femoral stress fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Posterior thigh compartment syndrome &ndash; Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) is an overuse injury that usually occurs in endurance athletes. Similar to acute compartment syndrome, CECS is due to increased pressure within a muscle compartment that exceeds perfusion pressure and results in muscle and nerve ischemia. The primary symptom is pain that is described as aching, cramping, squeezing and tightness, and begins within minutes of starting the inciting activity. Pain is not sharp or focal over one area of the hamstring muscle, as occurs from an acute muscle strain, but is diffuse and cramping. Complete resolution of symptoms occurs after stopping the activity, usually within 10 to 20 minutes, whereas pain following a hamstring strain persists for hours to days. Diagnosis involves measurement of compartment pressures. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic exertional compartment syndrome&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sacroiliac joint dysfunction &ndash; Sacroiliac dysfunction refers to pain caused by dysfunction or abnormal motion at the sacroiliac joint. Diagnosis is made clinically, as imaging tests are usually normal. Physical exam maneuvers such as the FABER test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F99775\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99775 \">picture 7</a>) can usually distinguish pain from the sacroiliac joint. While pain may radiate to the posterior thigh, hamstring strength is typically unaffected and ultrasound examination is unremarkable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Piriformis syndrome &ndash; Piriformis syndrome remains a controversial condition that is diagnosed clinically. Symptoms involve a cramping or aching pain in the buttock <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proximal hamstring area. Pain is exacerbated by hip flexion combined with active hip external rotation or passive internal rotation. Symptoms of sciatic nerve involvement may be present (see immediately below). Focal piriformis muscle spasm may be palpable. Biomechanical assessment often reveals restricted hip external rotation and lumbosacral muscle tightness. Often there is tenderness over the sciatic notch that is aggravated by flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the hip (Las&egrave;gue sign). Weakness in hip rotation is common, but hamstring strength remains unaffected, even when symptoms radiate to the proximal posterior thigh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sciatic nerve irritation or compression &ndash; Sciatic nerve irritation most commonly occurs from a herniated lumbar disc (discussed above) but may be caused by compression from bone spurs or other abnormal tissue or bleeding, causing pain that radiates along its path into the posterior thigh, and possibly more distally. Radiation of pain to the low back may occur and lumbar radiculopathy should be ruled out. Local compression of the sciatic nerve can occur at the region of the piriformis or proximal hamstrings. In contrast, pain from hamstring injuries is typically focal at the site of injury without radiation. MRI reveals the cause of sciatic nerve compression in most cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Sciatic nerve'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pelvic bone tumor &ndash; Rarely, benign or malignant tumors develop in the pelvic bones in the region where the hamstring muscles originate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>]. Pain may initially mimic that of a hamstring strain, but unlike such strains persists despite rest and at night. Radiographs or CT reveals such tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-tumors-diagnosis-and-biopsy-techniques#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone tumors: Diagnosis and biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Distal thigh:</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) &ndash; DVT can cause pain in the area of the hamstring, but pain is more diffuse than is typical for a hamstring muscle or tendon injury and nonfocal. Clots this proximal in the lower extremity are typically associated with significant swelling and thigh circumference is greater than the unaffected side. Doppler ultrasound studies can identify clot within the vein and demonstrate the normal appearance of the hamstrings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Meniscal injury &ndash; Pain from an acute injury of the posterior portion of a meniscus may be confused with that of a distal hamstring injury. The two can usually be distinguished by the history and examination findings. The mechanism for meniscal injury typically involves rotation or twisting of the knee. Provocative tests of the meniscus (McMurray, Thessaly, Apley) are usually positive, while the hamstrings themselves are nontender and provocative tests (eg, knee flexion against resistance) normal. If the meniscal injury has been present for a few days or longer, the hamstrings may be tender from overuse, as the patient may favor walking with a bent knee to minimize discomfort from the injured meniscus. Ultrasound examination of the hamstrings shows a normal appearance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniscal-injury-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniscal injury of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrocnemius injury &ndash; Gastrocnemius injuries can cause extensive swelling, and since the hamstring tendons cross those of the gastrocnemius the swelling may extend to both tendon sheaths. Gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursitis causes the tenosynovium to become extensively swollen and appear like a bursa wrapping around the tendons. All these injuries can cause pain when the hamstrings are tested, but the area of maximal tenderness typically involves the musculotendinous junction of the gastrocnemius and proximal Achilles tendon, rather than the distal hamstring muscles and tendons. Ultrasound effectively demonstrates gastrocnemius injuries, and normal hamstring appearance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calf-injuries-not-involving-the-achilles-tendon#H87894858\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calf injuries not involving the Achilles tendon&quot;, section on 'Gastrocnemius strain'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Popliteus injury &ndash; The popliteus muscle crosses under the biceps femoris before attaching to the lateral femoral condyle. Thus, pain caused by a popliteus injury occurs close to the insertion of the distal biceps femoris. Palpation of the popliteus and provocative examination maneuvers (eg, resisted internal knee rotation) elicit pain from a popliteus injury, but not from a hamstring injury. The popliteus is easily visualized with ultrasound, which can be used to distinguish between popliteus and hamstring injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calf-injuries-not-involving-the-achilles-tendon#H87894746\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calf injuries not involving the Achilles tendon&quot;, section on 'Popliteus tendinopathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome &ndash; Popliteal artery entrapment is an uncommon cause of peripheral vascular disease in young fit individuals that presents with symptoms and signs of progressive claudication or sudden limb ischemia. Repeated popliteal artery compression causes trauma to the arterial wall, leading to premature localized atherosclerosis. Arterial Doppler ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiography confirms the diagnosis. The patient typically feels a cramping type of pain in mid popliteal space radiating into the calf and not directly over the hamstring insertions, which appear normal on ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calf-injuries-not-involving-the-achilles-tendon#H167908502\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calf injuries not involving the Achilles tendon&quot;, section on 'Popliteal artery entrapment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H1231035358\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Popliteal cyst &ndash; A popliteal cyst presents as posterior knee pain caused by pressure in the popliteal space from a synovial cyst. Diagnosis is made clinically and is usually obvious based on appearance. The cyst is most apparent with the patient standing and the knee in full extension. Pressure from the cyst can be relieved with knee flexion to approximately 45 degrees. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, ultrasound can both identify the cyst and demonstrate normal appearance of the hamstrings.

Any recommendation for surgical treatment is based upon expert opinion, case series, and cohort studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps to determine the need for orthopedic referral by identifying complete versus partial ruptures and quantifying the degree of muscular retraction (see <a href=\"#H4095799\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above).

However, avulsions should be referred to an orthopedist or sports medicine specialist to determine whether surgical management may be needed. While opinions vary and the number of clinicians using more conservative approaches is substantial, classic references recommend surgery for larger bony avulsions with hamstring retraction greater than 2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>].</p><p>Complete proximal hamstring ruptures (Grade III) should be referred to an orthopedist for evaluation and possible repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86518\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86518 \">image 7</a>).

The great majority of relevant studies involve small numbers of patients, raising the possibility of Type 2 error. Therefore, our treatment suggestions below are based primarily upon small case series and clinical experience.

Elastic wraps (eg, ACE bandage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100206\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100206 \">picture 8</a>)) or taping are frequently used by trainers acutely. During treatment, many athletes continue to use materials to protect and compress the muscles, such as wraps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100206\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100206 \">picture 8</a>), fabric sleeves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51086\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51086 \">picture 9</a>) or compression pants. Cryotherapy appears to be a safe and effective means of reducing pain and likely plays a role in lowering tissue metabolism and reducing secondary hypoxic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

In <strong>rare</strong> instances, a short course of opioids may be needed to treat severe injuries. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been used for many years to reduce pain and inflammation. However, the only published study to assess the effectiveness of NSAID therapy for hamstring injury is a double-blinded, randomized trial of 75 injuries that reported no overall difference in pain, swelling, strength, or endurance between the NSAID and placebo groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. A nonsignificant trend towards reduction in pain was found in patients with more severe muscle strains.</p><p>Concern has been raised that NSAID therapy for muscle injury may delay healing, weaken tissue, and lead to impaired function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/10,74,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,74,80</a>]. However, there is no clinical evidence to suggest that short-term use of NSAIDs in the treatment of hamstring injury has important deleterious effects. If NSAIDs are used, the duration of treatment should be limited (generally no longer than five to seven days) and based upon patient response. The effect of NSAIDs on tendon healing is discussed separately.

However, our suggestion is based upon scant evidence and glucocorticoid injection may be beneficial in some cases.

Glucocorticoids reduce pain, inhibit cytokine production and the inflammatory cascade, and they may reduce fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and scar formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/75,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515453\"><span class=\"h2\">PRP and other injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of injectable medications, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>], have been used or proposed for the treatment of acute muscle injury, but evidence supporting their use in humans is limited and conflicting. Other injectable substances that some researchers have considered for use in acute muscle injury include autologous blood, autologous conditioned serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], prolotherapy, Actovegin (protein-free extract obtained from calf blood), anti-fibrotic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suramin-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">suramin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>], and isolated growth factors, such as IGF-1.

In addition, current preparations are expensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. In one of the few double-blinded randomized trials of PRP therapy for acute hamstring strain, researchers reported no significant difference in the time until patients could return to sport (median 42 days in each group) or injury recurrence (16 percent in PRP group versus 14 percent in placebo group) among the 80 recreational and competitive athletes studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. Another randomized double-blinded trial of 90 professional athletes with acute hamstring injury confirmed by MRI found no benefit (ie, return to play was not faster; reinjury rates were no different) from a single PRP injection compared to intensive physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. A single-blinded study of 28 patients with hamstring injury reported faster return to play in those treated with PRP versus controls but is limited by its small size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. A consensus statement from the International Olympic Committee on the use of PRP in sports medicine states: &quot;At present there is little scientific support for the use of PRP for the management of muscle strain injuries&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Nevertheless, the published evidence supporting the majority of these treatments is limited. Pending further study, several reasonable approaches to rehabilitation may be used. We suggest using the functional rehabilitation program described in the attached table and reference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77519\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77519 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This program incorporates the following elements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiplanar movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercises to enhance trunk stability and proprioception</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agility training</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eccentric strength exercises for the hamstring</p><p/><p>For each of the three phases of this program, it is important that the intensity of the exercises is increased gradually.<strong> </strong>Video demonstrations of several rehabilitative techniques used in this program are available to those with access to the Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Once the injured hamstring has healed sufficiently to allow patients to begin performing strengthening exercises, we suggest incorporating three specific exercises that involve eccentric contraction into any rehabilitation program. In two randomized trials (described below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/89,95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,95,96</a>], these exercises led to a significantly shorter time until athletes could return to full sport. The exercises are described below, and video demonstrations are available in the on-line supplement to the trials published on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The Extender</strong> &ndash; The patient lies supine with their uninjured leg flat on the ground. Next, the patient flexes the hip of their injured leg to approximately 90 degrees, and stabilizes the thigh of that injured leg by grasping behind the knee with both hands. Maintaining this position, the patient then slowly performs knee extensions to the point just before pain is felt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98853\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef98853 \">movie 1</a>). The patient performs three sets of 12 repetitions, twice daily if possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The Diver</strong> &ndash; As the name suggests, this exercise simulates a diving motion to create an eccentric stress on the hamstring. Beginning from an upright position, the patient bears weight only on the injured leg with the knee bent slightly. While maintaining the torso and thigh of the uninjured leg in a straight line, the patient slowly flexes at the hip of the injured leg, thereby bending forward, while extending both arms straight ahead (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F106339\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef106339 \">movie 2</a>). The knee of the supporting leg remains slightly bent during the maneuver while the knee of the leg being lifted (uninjured leg) is bent to approximately 90 degrees. The patient slowly returns to the starting position, and repeats the movement for a total of six repetitions. The patient performs three sets every other day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The Glider</strong> &ndash; This exercise is essentially a slow, controlled front split (not a slide split). It requires a low friction sock to be worn on the foot of the uninjured leg. The patient begins with the trunk upright, one hand holding a firm support (eg, securely attached railing) at their side, and the legs slightly split. The patient's body weight is placed entirely on the heel of the injured leg with the knee of that leg flexed to approximately 10 to 20 degrees. Slowly, the patient allows the uninjured leg to slide backward to a point just before pain develops in the hamstring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F106340\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef106340 \">movie 3</a>). As the leg slides back, the patient inclines their torso forward over the injured leg to maintain weight on it. Using both arms for assistance, the patient returns to the starting position. Every third day, the patient performs three sets of four repetitions.</p><p/><p>Controlled studies of hamstring injury rehabilitation are scant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/4,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,97</a>].

The time to return to activity was significantly shorter for athletes treated with the L-protocol regardless of whether they had sustained a sprinting-type or stretching-type of hamstring injury.

According to observational studies, the time needed to return to preinjury fitness is longer in athletes with strains sustained from stretching type injuries compared with those sustained from high-speed running (mean 31 versus 16 weeks), although these differences did not reach statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/47,50,51,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50,51,55</a>]. </p><p>According to a systematic review of studies of return to play following a hamstring injury, other factors associated with a prolonged recovery include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries requiring &gt;1 day before normal ambulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substantial deficits in range of motion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive or severe injury based on MRI or ultrasound findings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretching- (as opposed to sprinting) type injury (eg, dance)</p><p/><p>With aggressive rehabilitation programs, athletes with significant hamstring injuries return to sport in approximately two weeks, but timing ranges from weeks to months, according to limited data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/8,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,78</a>]. For patients with physically demanding work, clinicians must consider the functional requirements of the job. In many such cases, a rehabilitation protocol similar to that used for participants in high-risk sports is appropriate, and the time needed to return to activity similar. Nevertheless, data for specific occupations does not exist and all recommendations about returning to work must be tailored to the individual's job and clinical status.</p><p>Given the variability in healing rates following hamstring injuries, clinical assessment must guide decisions about returning to activity. Before returning to full sport or physically demanding work, individuals need near-normal knee range of motion and normal bilateral concentric and eccentric strength, tested at 90 degrees and at 15 to 30 degrees of knee flexion with the patient prone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/59,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,63</a>]. Functional testing, including running, cutting, and any sport-specific or work-specific motions, should be evaluated, and there should be no sign of functional deficits, gait abnormalities, or pain. Focal muscle tenderness is associated with a high risk of reinjury. Diagnostic imaging with MRI or ultrasound either at baseline or near the completion of rehabilitation does not predict reinjury as effectively as clinical evaluation just prior to the athlete's return to play [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/54,59,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,59,112</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23894954\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p>In a study of rugby athletes, those with prior hamstring injuries who returned to play only after eliminating significant limb to limb differences in hamstring strength had a far lower risk of injury recurrence than those who returned to play while strength discrepancies persisted, suggesting that rehabilitation to both strengthen the hamstring and reduce asymmetries reduces the risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. While evidence is limited, other studies support this concept of minimizing strength discrepancies before returning to play [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/42,113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,113,114</a>].</p><p>The Askling H test incorporates a ballistic movement to assess hamstring flexibility and can be used as a complement to other clinical assessments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. We use the H test to help determine when an athlete is ready to begin easy running as part of their rehabilitation. Although not well studied, our clinical experience suggests the H test is a useful guide. The test should not be performed unless all other basic physical assessments (eg, muscle palpation, strength testing) suggest the hamstring is healed.</p><p>To perform the H test, the patient lies supine and performs a straight leg raise with their knee in full extension as fast as possible. The patient is told to elevate the leg to the highest point that does not cause significant pain. After one practice trial with submaximal effort, the patient performs three consecutive attempts. If the subject experiences any pain or hesitancy during the test, they are not ready to begin running and are not allowed to return to play. After approximately two weeks, the test may be repeated if the initial attempt was unsuccessful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15303391\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15303399\"><span class=\"h2\">Reinjury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary complication after a hamstring injury is the increased risk of reinjury to the same muscle. The rate of reinjury is at least 30 percent, and some studies report rates as high as 60 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/4,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,8</a>]. Lifetime reinjury rates vary considerably by activity.</p><p>A systematic review of recurrent hamstring injury reported that increased severity of the initial injury and ipsilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction are associated with an increased risk of reinjury while rehabilitation consisting primarily of functional stability and agility training is associated with a decreased risk. However, the authors of the review emphasized the low quality of the available evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Developing and maintaining muscle strength, and limiting discrepancies in strength relative to the ipsilateral quadriceps and contralateral hamstring may also reduce the risk of reinjury. (See <a href=\"#H23894884\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23894891\" class=\"local\">'Sport-specific risks'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23895010\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care and rehabilitation'</a> above.)</p><p>MRI findings have not been found to be a useful prognostic tool for determining reinjury risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15303406\"><span class=\"h2\">Hamstring syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another potential complication of hamstring injury is chronic, radiating, sciatica-type pain in the region of the gluteal muscles and ischial tuberosity where the hamstring muscles originate. Different terms have been used to describe this syndrome, which is associated with prior hamstring tears, including hamstring syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and proximal hamstring syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic triad for the condition is pain induced by sitting, stretching the affected posterior thigh (ie, hip flexion plus knee extension), and running fast. Direct pressure at the site of pain may reproduce sciatic symptoms. Cyclic stress involving repeated hip flexion and knee extension causes persistent pain near the ischial tuberosity that radiates down the posterior thigh. While Ultrasound may demonstrate fibrosis around the sciatic nerve and chronic changes at the ischial tuberosity, MRI is considered the best imaging study to detect sciatic compression and delineate pathological changes at or near the ischial tuberosity.</p><p>A number of explanations for this syndrome have been proposed. There is operative and radiological evidence that scar tissue forms around the sciatic nerve following some hamstring injuries, and scar tissue may play a role in this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/16-18,20,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18,20,70,71</a>]. Alternatively, congenital fibrotic bands that irritate the sciatic nerve may be the cause. These scars or fibrotic bands compress the sciatic nerve, causing the symptoms described above.</p><p>Some researchers believe the syndrome may be due to a proximal hamstring tendinopathy. One study of the histopathology from 15 cases of persistent ischial tuberosity and gluteal pain following hamstring injury reported that all specimens exhibited classic findings of tendinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Chronic pain is associated with tendinopathy of numerous tendons, including the Achilles, extensor carpi radialis brevis (tennis elbow), and patellar, and this study suggests that the proximal hamstring syndrome may result from tendon degradation, release of pain producing substances, and diminished tendon heterogeneity, similar to other chronic tendinopathies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The proximal hamstring syndrome is not well understood and there is insufficient data to provide clear guidance about treatment. Surgery to decompress the nerve may be needed for cases in which a well-conceived and rigorously followed physical therapy program is unsuccessful at improving symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

They can be defined as any strain or tear of any of the muscles or tendons within the hamstring group of the posterior thigh, including the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles. (See <a href=\"#H23894869\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23894877\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hamstring muscles' primary function is to decelerate the lower limb during the forward swing phase of running or walking; the hamstrings also contribute to the stability of the hip and knee during movement. Secondary functions include knee flexion and hip extension. (See <a href=\"#H1615166\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifiable risk factors for hamstring injury may include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inadequate warm-up</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased training volume</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle fatigue</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hamstring inflexibility</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hamstring weakness (may be weakness relative to quadriceps or to contralateral hamstring)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cross-pelvic posture (ie, lumbar lordosis with anterior pelvic tilt) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100726\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100726 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89722 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lumbar-pelvic weakness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poor biomechanics (eg, running or change of direction) (see <a href=\"#H23894884\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hamstring injury occurs when a sudden, forceful, eccentric contraction of the hamstring occurs against resistance. Most individuals with hamstring injuries present acutely complaining of the sudden onset of posterior thigh pain while performing a high-risk activity, such as sprinting. Focal warmth and tenderness at the site are common. Injury can usually be diagnosed on the basis of the history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H4095548\" class=\"local\">'History and mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23894954\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the diagnosis is unclear or a more detailed assessment of the hamstrings is needed, musculoskeletal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the best methods for assessing hamstring injuries. US allows for bedside evaluation of the muscles and tendons while they move. However, neither US nor MRI has shown strong efficacy for estimating recovery time. (See <a href=\"#H4095799\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of posterior thigh pain may be more difficult to determine in athletes with long standing pain, recurrent symptoms, or an unclear mechanism of injury. A differential diagnosis for posterior thigh pain is provided in the text. (See <a href=\"#H23894975\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The great majority of hamstring injuries can be managed successfully with rest and physical therapy. However, in some circumstances, operative repair may yield favorable results. Orthopedic consultation should be obtained in such circumstances, which include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complete (Grade III) proximal hamstring rupture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High-grade (Grade II or III) distal hamstring tears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In addition, hamstring avulsion injuries should be evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon or sports medicine specialist. (See <a href=\"#H23894996\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard treatment for acute hamstring injuries includes protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (PRICE). Rehabilitation involves a gradual progression of exercises designed to improve the function of the hamstring muscles and the entire posterior kinetic chain. Successful hamstring rehabilitation programs emphasize eccentric strengthening exercises. Programs for rehabilitation and prevention have much in common; sample programs are provided.
