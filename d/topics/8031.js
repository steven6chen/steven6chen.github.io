Heart failure is a condition in which the heart doesn't pump as well as it should. It can cause symptoms such as trouble breathing, feeling tired, or swelling in the feet, legs, or belly.</p><p>Before you have a heart transplant, your doctor will try other treatments first. Your doctor will only recommend a heart transplant if all other treatments fail. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13054163\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens before I can get a heart transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before you can get a heart transplant, you need to go through a number of steps.</p><p>Your doctor will send you to a heart transplant center. At the heart transplant center, you will have exams and blood tests, and talk with different doctors. The doctors will ask about your:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medical conditions and medicines you take</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle (for example, smoking, alcohol, or drug use)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family and other support system</p><p/><p>You might also get a device to help your heart pump. This device is called an &quot;LVAD&quot; and goes inside your chest. Some people have an LVAD before they have a heart transplant. Some people have an LVAD instead of a heart transplant.</p><p>Not everyone who is sent to a heart transplant center will get a transplant. To be considered for a heart transplant, you need to meet certain conditions. For example, you need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe heart failure that hasn't gotten better with other treatments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not currently have certain other medical conditions, such as cancer or an infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agree not to smoke, drink, or use drugs &ndash; Doing these things can harm your new heart.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be willing to take medicines for the rest of your life after surgery</p><p/><p>If you meet all of the required conditions, your doctors will send your information to an organization called &quot;UNOS.&quot; UNOS keeps a list of every person in the country who is waiting for a heart transplant. When a new heart becomes available, UNOS decides who is next on the list to get it.</p><p>While you are waiting for your heart transplant, your doctors will follow your health closely. If your condition changes, they will let UNOS know.</p><p>Sometimes, people get other medical problems while they are waiting for their heart transplant. If you get other problems, you might need to wait longer while your doctor treats those problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13054170\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens when a heart becomes available?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a heart becomes available, UNOS chooses the person who is the best match for that heart. People who are waiting for a heart need to carry a cell phone or pager at all times so that they can be reached quickly.</p><p>When you get called for your heart transplant, you will need to get to the hospital quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13054177\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a heart transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, most people stay in the hospital for a few weeks before going home. In the hospital and at home, your doctors will follow you and do tests to make sure that your new heart is working correctly.</p><p>After a heart transplant, doctors will continue to do regular exams and tests on your heart. People with a heart transplant need to see their doctors regularly and take medicines for the rest of their lives. These medicines include &quot;anti-rejection medicines.&quot; They help the body's infection-fighting system (called the &quot;immune system&quot;) accept the new heart. Normally, the immune system helps people stay healthy by attacking objects in the body that came in from the outside (&quot;foreign objects&quot;). Anti-rejection medicines help keep the body from attacking the new heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13054184\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can people have after a heart transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, people do well after surgery. They can go to work and be active. But some people have problems after a heart transplant. These problems can happen right after the surgery or a few years later. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rejection of the new heart &ndash; Even though people take anti-rejection medicines, their body might still reject and attack the new heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrowing of the blood vessels in the new heart</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects from the anti-rejection medicines &ndash; These medicines have short-term side effects. For example, they increase a person's chance of getting infections. They also have long-term side effects. For example, they can increase a person's chance of getting certain types of cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13054191\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart transplantation (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
