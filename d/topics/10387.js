Skin involvement is common, and a variety of therapeutic interventions have been utilized for the treatment of cutaneous disease. However, scientific support for most treatments for cutaneous sarcoidosis is limited to observational studies, uncontrolled prospective studies, small case series, individual case reports, and opinions of respected authorities. When managing patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis, clinicians must first consider whether treatment is indicated. The options available for the treatment of skin lesions include both local and systemic therapies.</p><p>The treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations of cutaneous sarcoidosis and the management of other forms of sarcoidosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis: Initial therapy with glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-disease-refractory-to-glucocorticoid-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis: Disease refractory to glucocorticoid therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-in-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease in sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-and-hepatic-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal and hepatic sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoid-arthropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sarcoid arthropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16711891\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cutaneous sarcoidosis is not life-threatening and leads to physical impairment in only a minority of patients, the psychological and social impact of the disease can be devastating, supporting the need for treatment. In general, treatment is indicated in patients with cosmetically disfiguring, symptomatic, ulcerating, or progressively worsening skin disease. </p><p>However, the decision to treat is complicated by the unpredictable course of the disease (which includes the possibility for spontaneous remission in up to two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]), variability in the response to treatment, and the severe adverse effects associated with some therapies. In patients with stable, asymptomatic disease that is not associated with cosmetic disfigurement, forgoing treatment is reasonable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3545700\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When cutaneous lesions are the only indication for treatment of sarcoidosis, the risks and benefits of treatment must be considered carefully. Few randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of therapies for cutaneous sarcoidosis, and data on the various treatment options are primarily limited to the results of small uncontrolled prospective studies, retrospective analyses, and case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Local corticosteroid therapy is a common first-line treatment for cutaneous sarcoidosis. Despite the lack of high-quality evidence to support efficacy, the experience with topical corticosteroid therapy is extensive and favorable responses are often achieved. However, thick plaques often do not respond completely to topical corticosteroids and intralesional corticosteroids can be impractical to administer in patients with extensive lesions. In addition, injection of sensitive areas such as the nose can be difficult for some patients to tolerate. Our clinical experience indicates that many patients fail to achieve complete responses with local therapy alone. We consider treatment with systemic agents in patients who cannot be managed solely with local therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16711898\" class=\"local\">'First-line agents'</a> below.)</p><p>The risks of adverse effects from systemic agents have to be weighed against the benefits. Common systemic agents utilized to treat patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis who fail to improve adequately with local therapy include systemic glucocorticoids, antimalarial agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Although these agents appear to be beneficial in the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis, the efficacies of these drugs have not been directly compared. Thus, the selection of the most appropriate systemic agent primarily is made based upon consideration of factors such as patient acceptance of the treatment regimen, drug monitoring requirements, and drug adverse effects. </p><p>Due to the serious side effects associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoids, we try to avoid prescribing these agents. However, patients with rapidly progressive or progressively disfiguring sarcoidosis may benefit from systemic glucocorticoid therapy. When glucocorticoid therapy is required, we limit the duration of the course of glucocorticoids to the shortest time necessary and the smallest effective dose. We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antimalarials as glucocorticoid-sparing agents to decrease the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, and whenever possible, as alternatives to treatment with glucocorticoids (see <a href=\"#H261917492\" class=\"local\">'Second-line agents'</a> below). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Minocycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> have also been utilized for the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis, although the data to support their efficacy are weak. The relatively favorable side effect profiles of these agents have contributed to their status as alternative systemic medications for cutaneous sarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"#H8966978\" class=\"local\">'Tetracycline derivatives'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis that is refractory to the treatments above may respond to select anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies. In particular, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> has been utilized successfully for patients with refractory cutaneous sarcoidosis; however, there are conflicting data on its efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H8965978\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> below.)</p><p>A variety of other interventions, including alternative systemic agents, phototherapy, and laser therapy have been reported to be effective in small numbers of patients. Additional studies are necessary to explore the efficacy and safety of treatments for cutaneous sarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"#H8965978\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3545693\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best approach to management for specific variants of cutaneous sarcoidosis remains unclear. Treatment of lupus pernio almost always is required due to its destructive and disfiguring nature. The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> in lupus pernio refractory to other therapeutic agents has been evaluated in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Treatment data for other variants of cutaneous sarcoidosis are more limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-sarcoidosis#H18191778\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"#H1706660\" class=\"local\">'Infliximab'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16711898\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Widespread use of topical and intralesional corticosteroids for this disease primarily is based upon clinical experience. Partial or even complete improvement can be achieved with topical corticosteroid therapy, and the amount absorbed transcutaneously rarely leads to systemic symptoms. Local corticosteroid therapy also may be used as an adjunctive intervention in patients who achieve only partial responses to systemic medications.</p><p>Not all patients should be managed initially with only local therapy. Patients with rapidly progressive or disfiguring sarcoidosis are appropriate candidates for early systemic glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H107898623\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16714853\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Group 1, superpotent topical corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice for the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. In an uncontrolled study that included patients with a variety of chronic skin diseases, once-weekly application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate lotion under a hydrocolloid dressing led to improvement in sarcoidal papules in all three patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis within three to five weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a separate case report, application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=halobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">halobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% ointment twice daily for 10 weeks led to considerable flattening of lesions of lupus pernio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>We typically instruct patients to apply <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate or another superpotent corticosteroid ointment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) to skin lesions twice daily or once daily with occlusion. Because the risk for corticosteroid-induced cutaneous atrophy rises with drug potency, and atrophy is more likely to occur on the face than on the trunk or extremities, we frequently utilize medium-potency (group IV) creams or gels when treating facial lesions. An exception to this practice is lupus pernio, which we have found usually requires the application of high potency agents.</p><p>We follow patients every two weeks to assess response and to evaluate for signs of atrophy. If there is no improvement after four weeks, we discontinue topical corticosteroids and initiate treatment with intralesional corticosteroids or systemic therapy. </p><p>Advantages of topical corticosteroids include their relative safety, ease of use, and lack of pain associated with administration. However, in our experience, topical corticosteroid monotherapy often fails to achieve complete lesion resolution without simultaneously inducing cutaneous atrophy. In addition, we have noted that intralesional therapy appears to be more effective than topical therapy for lupus pernio and other thick or nodular lesions, a finding that is likely related to insufficient drug penetration with topical therapy.</p><p>Skin atrophy, telangiectasias, and striae (as well as acne and purpura) can develop with prolonged use, or even with short-term use when potent or superpotent corticosteroids are used. However, topical percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids rarely is high enough to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, except when high-potency agents are applied over large areas of skin. The local and systemic adverse effects of topical corticosteroids are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16711906\"><span class=\"h2\">Intralesional corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although data on the use of intralesional corticosteroids for cutaneous sarcoidosis are limited to case series and case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], it is generally accepted that intralesional injection of corticosteroids leads to flattening and even resolution of cutaneous lesions. Intralesional corticosteroids offer the advantage of high corticosteroid concentrations in the dermal areas where granulomas are present. As with topical corticosteroids, intralesional corticosteroids are often used in combination with systemic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Triamcinolone</a> acetonide, an intermediate-acting corticosteroid, is preferred for intralesional injection due to its availability as a suspension, drug potency, low induction of pain with injection, and fairly long duration of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Concentrations of triamcinolone acetonide between 5 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> are usually injected every three to four weeks until lesion resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. Higher concentrations (up to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> increase the risk for adverse effects. </p><p>Initially, we inject intradermally approximately 0.1 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide diluted in saline to a 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> concentration into each injection site. We repeat intralesional injections every three to four weeks and, depending on the response to the previous treatment, continue or increase the triamcinolone concentration. Injections into lesions greater than 1 cm in size should be placed about 1 cm apart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although this treatment generally is well tolerated, the pain associated with intralesional injection may be difficult for some patients to tolerate, particularly if the lesions are located in sensitive areas or multiple lesions are present. Potential adverse effects of intralesional corticosteroid therapy include cutaneous atrophy, hypopigmentation, and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In order to reduce the risk of the latter, we try to limit the total dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide administered during a single treatment session to &le;20 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;, section on 'Side effects, complications, and pitfalls'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107898623\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8965336\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although systemic glucocorticoids are considered the standard of care for rapidly progressive or progressively disfiguring sarcoidosis, there are no prospective, randomized studies that evaluate the efficacy of these agents for cutaneous sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/7,8,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,24-27</a>]. In a retrospective study of 116 treatment courses in 54 patients with lupus pernio, monotherapy with systemic glucocorticoids was associated with complete or near resolution of lupus pernio lesions in 20 percent of treatment courses and at least some improvement in 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, a 1997 systematic review of published reports found that skin lesions resolved in 12 out of 16 patients with ulcerative sarcoidosis who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> as monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and a small retrospective study and case series have documented improvement in subcutaneous sarcoidosis during treatment with systemic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/8,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis: Initial therapy with glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action of glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal regimen for systemic glucocorticoids therapy is unknown. The risk of adverse effects increases with both the dose and duration of treatment. Therefore, the dose should be lowered when the lesions begin to decrease in size and the glucocorticoid should be discontinued as soon as an adequate response is achieved. However, some patients relapse during glucocorticoid tapering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Combination therapy with systemic drugs that are both glucocorticoid-sparing and disease-modifying agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> derivatives, may facilitate reductions in the dose of systemic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment with 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> followed by a taper to the lowest dose feasible has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Other authors have suggested treatment with 30 mg prednisone every other day followed by a taper to 15 mg every other day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In our practice, we begin treatment with 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of prednisone, and if significant improvement is not evident after two weeks, we increase the dose to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> and initiate simultaneous treatment with a glucocorticoid-sparing agent (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>). Once satisfactory improvement is attained, we taper the dose of prednisone by 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-withdrawal#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid withdrawal&quot;, section on 'Recommended tapering regimen'</a>.)</p><p>Tapering of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> can be attempted in patients who respond well to the initial 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> dose. If disease activity recurs, we return to the lowest effective dose of prednisone and add a glucocorticoid-sparing agent prior to additional attempts at tapering. </p><p>Calcium and vitamin D supplementation for prevention of osteoporosis are generally recommended for patients who receive long-term glucocorticoids and should be considered in all patients who do not have sarcoidosis-induced hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Close monitoring of serum calcium is essential in any patient with sarcoidosis in whom calcium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitamin D are supplemented to detect rapid development of hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/1,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30,31</a>]. The adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy are discussed separately.

Data on the efficacy of all of these agents are limited. </p><p>Despite limited scientific supporting data, these agents are widely used to treat cutaneous sarcoidosis. We prefer to treat patients with these agents rather than systemic glucocorticoids when topical therapy is insufficiently effective or impractical. An exception is patients with rapidly progressive or disfiguring sarcoidosis, in whom initial treatment with systemic glucocorticoids can be beneficial (see <a href=\"#H107898623\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> above). In cases that require more than a brief course of a systemic glucocorticoid, we use these second-line agents to reduce the glucocorticoid dose. The time of therapeutic onset ranges from a few weeks to several months.</p><p>Patients who fail to respond to an initial second-line agent may benefit from trials of other therapies.

Antimalarials impede the presentation of antigenic peptides to CD4-positive helper T cells and interfere with the release of cytokines and other mediators associated with granuloma formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The effect of antimalarials is predominantly suppressive and not seen for four to six weeks after initiation of therapy. </p><p>Data on the efficacy of antimalarial drugs for cutaneous sarcoidosis are limited to a few small uncontrolled studies, most of which indicate a favorable effect of antimalarials in the majority of treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cutaneous-sarcoidosis/abstract/4,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,33</a>].
