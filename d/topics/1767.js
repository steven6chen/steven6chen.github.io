Based upon the retrospective review of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) database that included 4776 bariatric surgery patients, the rate of failure to be discharged from the hospital within 30 days was 4.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Serious complications that occur during the in-hospital admission can also occur after discharge, such as a leak, a pulmonary embolus, or a myocardial infarction. The overall morbidity rate for serious complications ranges from approximately 3.4 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/2-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-13</a>], and varies with operative procedure (eg, RYGB, LAGB), operative approach (open versus laparoscopic), patient age, body mass index (BMI), and comorbid illnesses. Overall complication rates have decreased over time, from 2005 to 2006 (4.6 percent) to 2013 (3.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations: Perioperative morbidity and mortality&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The type of operative procedure affects the morbidity rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For example, the morbidity associated with LAGB is less than is seen with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). A one-year analysis of 4756 patients from the American College of Surgeons&rsquo; National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database showed the LAGB carried a lower 30-day rate of major complications compared with LRYGB (1.0 versus 3.3 percent), return visits to the operating room (0.9 versus 3.6 percent), and shorter postoperative stay (median 1 versus 2 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Similarly, analysis of the ACS NSQIP database showed that patients who had an open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (ORYGB) compared with an LRYGB had significantly higher morbidity (7.4 versus 3.4 percent), return visits to the operating room (4.9 versus 3.6 percent), and postoperative length of stay (median three versus two days) than patients who had laparoscopic RYGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) appears to be the riskiest procedure with the highest 30-day mortality of 1.2 percent, and the one associated with the most complications and highest morbidity rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12426149\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1253009695\"><span class=\"h3\">Leaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anastomotic leaks or staple line leaks are a dreaded complication after bariatric procedures. From an RYGB, they can happen at the gastrojejunal or jejunojejunal anastomosis at a rate of approximately 1.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. From an SG, they can happen from the staple line at a rate of up to 7 percent, but generally the rate has decreased to around 2.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. From a BPD-DS, they can happen from the anastomoses or from the long stomach staple line at a rate of 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Typically, they will occur within the first week after the surgery. The most important aspect of treatment is early recognition. Patients who present with a persistent heart rate above 120 and dyspnea are very concerning for a leak. Other symptoms include fevers, abdominal pain, oral intolerance, and a &quot;feeling of doom.&quot; Computed tomography (CT) scans and fluoroscopy exams can help confirm the diagnosis, but negative studies should not preclude an operative exploration if the tachycardia above 120 beats per minute continues.</p><p>For hemodynamically abnormal patients, an operative exploration should be done expeditiously. The tenets of the operation include primary repair or a buttressing with omentum, washout, extensive drainage, and feeding tube placement. This can be done laparoscopically. For hemodynamically normal patients, radiology-guided placement of drainage catheters or endoscopic placement of clips, fibrin glue, stents, or negative pressure suction have all been used with success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12426577\"><span class=\"h3\">Marginal ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marginal ulcers typically occur within 30 days after the RYGB operations at the gastrojejunal anastomosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66371\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66371 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and at the gastroileal junction following a BPD-DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], despite bypass or removal of most of the acid secreting cells of the stomach. The risk of a marginal ulcer following bariatric operations based upon a retrospective review of the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database (BOLD) was 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, in a prospective study of 81 patients undergoing an LRYGB, upper endoscopy at one month after surgery identified a marginal ulcer in 12 (12.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In comparison, marginal ulcers occurred late (17 months) in only 0.6 percent. In addition, based upon a retrospective review of 1300 obese patients undergoing BPD-DS, the incidence of a marginal ulcer following a BPD-DS was 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] while the incidence of a marginal ulcer following a BPD only was 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>The clinical presentation of marginal ulcers includes melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, or pain and obstructive symptoms as the swollen mucosa can occlude the anastomosis to the small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Early ulceration most likely is related to ischemia, too large of a pouch, or undiagnosed <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (<em>H. pylori)</em> infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacteriology-and-epidemiology-of-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacteriology and epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-diagnostic-tests-for-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for late presentation of a marginal ulcer include smoking, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), or gastrogastric fistula formation. Lifetime avoidance of smoking and NSAIDS is advised. If NSAIDS are necessary, a concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor is advised.

Following an LSG, stenosis can occur if the sleeve narrows, kinks, or twists. A retrospective review of 230 patients found that the risk of stenosis following an LRYGB, BPD-DS, or LSG is approximately 3.3, 1.2, and 3.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>The clinical presentation is consistent with an obstruction and includes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dysphagia. Endoscopic balloon dilation of the stenotic structures, including those resulting from an SG, is the first management option. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopy in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Stomal stenosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12430169\"><span class=\"h3\">Stomal obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute stomal obstruction is an early complication that can occur in up to 14 percent of LAGB patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/11,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25,26</a>]. Obstruction is usually caused by inclusion of excess perigastric fat, use of a band of insufficient diameter for the thickness of the tissue, or significant tissue edema. Patients usually present with persistent nausea, vomiting, and inability to tolerate secretions or oral intake. The diagnosis is confirmed with an upper gastrointestinal series demonstrating no passage of contrast beyond the band.</p><p>Acute stomal obstruction due to edema can initially be treated conservatively with nasogastric tube decompression until the edema subsides, although a potential for aspiration pneumonia and gastric ischemia exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Persistent obstruction requires surgical revision or removal of the band. Meticulous removal of excess perigastric fat at the time of initial band placement may help prevent this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The use of larger diameter bands may also help to reduce the incidence of acute postoperative obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12430932\"><span class=\"h3\">Small bowel obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small bowel obstruction (SBO) can occur following any intra-abdominal procedure. SBO can occur from misconstruction during RYGB or BPD-DS operations, adhesion formation (open and laparoscopic procedures), or port site hernia, although uncommon within 30 days of surgery. Early SBO is usually caused by a technical error such as the failure to reapproximate the fascia from a port site or potential internal hernia sites. </p><p>In a prospective study that included 2126 patients undergoing LRYGB, SBO following bariatric procedures occurred in approximately 0.5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Other retrospective reviews report a range of SBO in 0 to 8 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. After an RYGB, an internal hernia can occur through the mesentery of the jejunojejunal anastomosis or posterior to the gastrojejunal anastomosis. An uncommon etiology of a SBO is Petersen&rsquo;s hernia, which can occur when a retrocolic Roux limb is created, particularly if the transverse mesocolon defect is not closed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-operative-procedures-thirty-day-morbidity-and-mortality/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation and management of a small bowel obstruction are reviewed elsewhere.

Generally, though, if patients can stay hydrated and tolerate a thin liquid diet, they will not need readmission or workup for the aforementioned causes of early morbidity. Patients with mild gastrointestinal symptoms are generally kept on a liquid diet for one to two weeks after the operation and slowly transition to more solid forms of food over the next one to two months. Surgical edema is typically the cause of these symptoms, which should be self-limited. Patients who continue to present with recurring or worsening symptoms should undergo further workup for more serious complications as discussed above. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12426343\"><span class=\"h3\">Venous thromboembolism/pulmonary embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of a venous thromboembolism (VTE) or pulmonary embolus (PE) extends past the 30-day postoperative period.
