It happens when tiny insects called mites burrow under your skin to lay their eggs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480923696\"><span class=\"h1\">How did I get scabies?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You probably caught scabies from someone else who has it. The condition spreads easily between people who are in close contact. It is also possible to catch scabies from the clothes of someone with the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480923703\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there symptoms besides itching?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The main symptom is itching, but there are other symptoms. People with scabies usually get little red bumps or blisters on their skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54705\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54705 \">picture 1</a>). Sometimes the bumps are hard to see. Some people even notice tiny tunnels in their skin where the mites have buried themselves.</p><p>These are the body parts that are most often affected by scabies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79896\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79896 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fingers and webbing between the fingers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin folds around the wrists, elbows, and knees</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The armpits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The area around the nipples (especially in women)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The waist</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The penis and scrotum (in men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower buttocks and upper thighs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sides and bottoms of the feet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480923710\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, see your doctor or nurse. If you have scabies, he or she can give you medicine to get rid of it. You can get infections if you keep scratching at it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480923717\"><span class=\"h1\">How is scabies treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse can give you a prescription for a medicine that kills the mites that cause scabies. A medicine that is often used is called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">permethrin</a>&quot; (brand names: Elimite, Acticin).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Permethrin</a> comes in a cream or lotion that you put on your skin. You must use the medicine exactly how the doctor or nurse tells you to. Otherwise it might not work.</p><p>A medicine that comes in a pill, called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ivermectin</a>,&quot; can also cure scabies. You need a prescription for this medicine.</p><p>If you are being treated for scabies, the doctor or nurse will probably want the people who live with you to be treated, too. They might be carrying the mite that causes scabies, even if they have no symptoms.</p><p>When you start treatment, wash all the clothes you and others in your home wore in the last 4 to 5 days in hot water. Then dry them in a dryer on high heat. You should also wash any bedclothes (sheets and blankets) or towels people in your home have touched. If your child is getting treated, wash his or her stuffed animals, too. Dry-cleaning will also get rid of the scabies mite. Any bedding, clothing, or towels that you cannot wash or dry-clean should be placed in a sealed plastic bag for at least 3 days. Scabies mites usually die without contact with human skin after a few days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480923724\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to stop the itching?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can take medicines called antihistamines. These are the medicines people often take for allergies.</p><p>Itching can last for several weeks, even after the scabies mite is gone. Your doctor or nurse might suggest you use a cream with a medicine called a steroid to help with the itching. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.) These steroids relieve itching and swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480923731\"><span class=\"h1\">When can my child go back to school?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child can go back to school after one day of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480923738\"><span class=\"h1\">Some people get a severe kind of scabies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with HIV or AIDS, cancer, or other conditions can get a severe type of scabies called &quot;crusted scabies.&quot; Crusted scabies causes large, crusty red patches or bumps to form on the skin. It spreads more easily than regular scabies. People with crusted scabies often get it on their head, hands, and feet. They sometimes need to take pills to get rid of scabies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480923745\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=scabies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Scabies (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
