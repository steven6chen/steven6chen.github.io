Muscle weakness due to dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction (myasthenia) may be an acquired disorder, and the vast majority of patients who develop generalized myasthenia in adolescence or adulthood have autoantibodies that play a pathogenetically important role. Such antibody-mediated disease is referred to as MG.</p><p>When the symptoms of MG are isolated to the levator palpebrae superioris, orbicularis oculi, and the oculomotor muscles, it is referred to as ocular MG (OMG). Over one-half of all patients with MG initially present with isolated ptosis, diplopia, or both, and no signs or symptoms of weakness elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Approximately 15 percent of all patients with MG have isolated OMG as the only manifestation of their disease. Although the disease pathology at the neuromuscular junction is not known to be distinct from generalized MG (GMG), there are several important and unique differences between OMG and GMG with regard to diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>This topic will discuss OMG. Other aspects of MG are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) is not known to be different than that for generalized MG (GMG). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is uncertain why ocular muscles are frequently involved in myasthenia and why the disease stays localized to the ocular muscles in 15 percent of cases. It has been proposed that subtle alterations in the function of extraocular muscles are more likely to produce symptoms than in limb muscles, and that the levator palpebrae, under constant activation during eye opening, may be more susceptible to fatigue. Other factors may contribute to this phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with OMG are more likely to be seronegative for acetylcholine receptor antibodies than patients with GMG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraocular muscles (but not the levator palpebrae) are unique in their expression of fetal acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction; however, there is no evidence for specific immunological targeting of this receptor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The junctional folds of muscle endplates are sparse in the extraocular and levator muscles, perhaps producing a lower safety factor for neuromuscular transmission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement regulatory genes are expressed differently in extraocular muscles, perhaps reducing protective mechanisms to complement-mediated tissue injury.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) is characterized by ptosis and oculomotor paresis. Some patients also have mild orbicularis oculi weakness. This triad: ptosis, oculomotor paresis, and orbicularis oculi weakness should prompt an evaluation for MG. As with generalized MG (GMG), signs and symptoms of OMG are characterized by fluctuating, fatigable weakness. Most patients note ocular symptoms that worsen as the day progresses or with tasks such as driving. Patients may report that they have mild or no symptoms upon wakening. The examination may elicit signs of fatigable levator and extraocular muscle weakness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ptosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ptosis is often unilateral or asymmetric on presentation. A historical pattern of ptosis alternating from one side to the other is nearly always a sign of OMG. Old photos may help to determine if ptosis is new or longstanding. Measurements of the eyelid position and levator palpebrae muscle function using standard methods help to identify and quantify weakness as well as fluctuations associated with fatigue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ptosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ptosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Examination for eyelid fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the ptosis fluctuates throughout the examination, then evidence for fatigability of the levator muscle is present. Evidence for fatigue can also be elicited:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged activation of the levator palpebrae muscle is produced with sustained upgaze for one to two minutes. Enhancement of ptosis either during prolonged upgaze or upon return to primary gaze suggests fatigability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid fatigue after rest is another elicitable sign. This may be observed in the eyelid as a Cogan's lid twitch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The patient is asked to sustain downgaze briefly and then make a fast eye movement (or saccade) to primary gaze. An affected eyelid will quickly rise and then fall (by as little as 1 mm or more) such that the lid appears to twitch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyelid &quot;curtaining&quot; occurs when the more ptotic eyelid is passively lifted above the iris by the examiner and the contralateral eyelid becomes more ptotic by slowly drooping or &quot;curtaining.&quot; This phenomenon results because of equal innervation to both levator palpebrae superioris muscles (Hering's law) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;rest test&quot; looks for improvement in baseline ptosis after having the patient gently close his eyes for two to five minutes.</p><p/><p>While each of these signs suggests fatigable levator function, none are specific for OMG. Eyelid curtaining has been described in cases of third nerve palsies and in cases of narrowed palpebral fissures due to peripheral facial palsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diplopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Binocular diplopia (diplopia that is present only with both eyes open) is a prominent feature of OMG when ophthalmoparesis is present. At presentation, OMG may involve individual or multiple, bilateral ocular motor muscles. For patients with medial or lateral recti muscle involvement, diplopia will be binocular and horizontal. If the superior or inferior recti or the oblique muscles are involved, then there will be a vertical or diagonal component to the diplopia.</p><p>Virtually every ocular motility disorder, including those associated with isolated nerve palsies and even central nervous system brainstem pathways, such as internuclear ophthalmoplegia, has been described in OMG.</p><p>The cardinal positions of gaze are tested and observed for paresis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diplopia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diplopia&quot;, section on 'Examination'</a>.) As with ptosis, OMG can result in fatigable ocular motility. Fluctuation in either the degree of diplopia or in the direction of gaze that elicits the diplopia suggests fatigable ocular motor paresis. Prolonged or sustained gaze in the direction of action of an involved muscle may result in fatigue of the muscle with increasing paresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similarly, repeated red glass measurements during or after sustained gaze may reveal increasing degrees of strabismus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lagophthalmus, failure of the eye to fully close, is rare in OMG. However, some weakness of the orbicularis oculi is often demonstrable when the examiner attempts to open the eyes against forced eyelid closure, nearly impossible in the intact patient. The &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; sign of lagophthalmus after prolonged forced eyelid closure, suggests fatigue in this muscle.</p><p>Pupillary involvement is generally NOT seen in OMG. Descriptions of pupil abnormalities such as constrictor fatigue with repeated light stimulation as well as accommodation fatigue are findings that are not elicited in practice by most examiners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of signs and symptoms associated with ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) depends on the specific symptoms cluster:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated ptosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated ophthalmoparesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ptosis and ophthalmoparesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and other signs or symptoms of bulbar weakness</p><p/><p>The differential diagnoses of isolated ptosis and ophthalmoparesis are extensive and are presented elsewhere.

It can usually be differentiated from MG by the lack of ptosis and the presence of proptosis, lid retraction, lid lag, and periorbital edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Restricted eye movement in Grave's ophthalmopathy can be confirmed by forced duction testing, and the enlarged extraocular muscles can usually be seen on CT images of the orbits. However, thyroid disease can coexist with MG. As a result, screening thyroid function studies are usually a good idea before treatment is instituted, even when the diagnosis of MG is clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) are mitochondrial disorders that produce progressive, generally symmetric, ophthalmoparesis and ptosis. These patients frequently have slow saccades, an early sign that may suggest CPEO rather than MG, where saccades are normal.</p><p>CPEO generally remains isolated to the extraocular muscles, but KSS may ultimately produce generalized muscle weakness, cerebellar disease, and retinal degeneration, distinguishing this disorder from OMG. The majority of patients with KSS present with ptosis months to years before the onset of ophthalmoparesis. Patients with CPEO and KSS typically do not complain of diplopia. This is presumed to be due to the symmetric involvement of the ocular motility disturbance.

Associated abnormalities include cataracts, cardiac conduction defects, characteristic facies (long face with atrophy of temporalis and masseter), frontal balding, and variable intellectual impairment. Patients may also develop dysphagia and ophthalmoparesis in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oculopharyngeal dystrophy is muscular dystrophy characterized by slowly progressive ptosis and dysphagia with onset in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Weakness of the proximal muscles is commonly present upon initial presentation, but ophthalmoparesis typically develops after the onset of ptosis and dysphagia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oculopharyngeal-distal-and-congenital-muscular-dystrophies#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oculopharyngeal, distal, and congenital muscular dystrophies&quot;, section on 'Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Brainstem and motor cranial nerve pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural disease of the brainstem can cause isolated ocular symptoms. As examples, parasellar tumors and aneurysms can impair function of the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, leading to symptoms similar to ocular myasthenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The presence of trigeminal dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pupillary abnormalities is inconsistent with OMG and may point to a structural lesion. Brain MRI to exclude these disorders is warranted in unconfirmed cases of OMG.</p><p>Multiple motor cranial neuropathies, such as those produced by carcinomatous or lymphomatous meningitis, may also produce eye movement abnormalities that may be confused with MG. If the diagnosis of MG is not firmly established in cases of possible multiple cranial nerve abnormalities, examination of the cerebrospinal fluid for abnormal cells and cytology is usually necessary.</p><p>Among a series of 979 cases of multiple cranial nerve palsies (not necessarily including or isolated to the ocular muscles) tumor was the most prevalent cause (30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

It is not helpful for those with extraocular muscle weakness. It is based on the physiologic principle of improved neuromuscular transmission at lower muscle temperatures.</p><p>In the ice pack test, a bag is filled with ice and placed on the closed lid for one minute. The ice is then removed and the extent of ptosis is assessed immediately; the duration of improvement is short (less than one minute).

Use of lubricating drops and periods of abstinence from device use are critical to prevent corneal dryness and exposure keratopathy.</p><p>An eye patch, opaque contact lens, or occlusion of an eyeglass lens are simple ways to eliminate diplopia. A patch that is concave (to avoid injury to the cornea) can be worn over either eye; it is not necessary to alternate the patch between eyes in adults. Occlusion of an eyeglass lens with opaque tape or by &quot;scratching&quot; the lens surface works as an eye patch does. For cosmetic reasons, an opaque contact lens may be more acceptable than patching or an opaque eyeglass lens. These interventions also have the disadvantage of eliminating depth perception, which usually requires unoccluded vision in two eyes. Some patients require stereoscopic vision in their occupation. Other activities of daily living, such as driving and watching television, are also impaired with a loss of depth perception.</p><p>Prism lenses offer another nonpharmacologic alternative for patients with diplopia. If the ophthalmoparesis is stable over several weeks or months, prism lenses may minimize diplopia. However, fatigability and significant variability of eye movements will limit the benefit of prisms in patients with OMG until stabilization occurs. Press-on, flexible prism lenses are a cheaper alternative than ground-in prism lenses, and they can be removed if there is considerable fluctuation of the ophthalmoparesis. A disadvantage is that they can distort vision when the amount of prism needed is significant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticholinesterase agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pyridostigmine</a> (Mestinon) is the most commonly used anticholinesterase agent for symptomatic treatment of myasthenia. No randomized trials have studied the efficacy of anticholinesterase agents in OMG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Unfortunately, in our clinical experience, pyridostigmine treatment alone rarely results in resolution of ocular symptoms, particularly diplopia. &#160;In one case series, pyridostigmine treatment alone produced resolution of primary gaze diplopia in only 6.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It is best used for very mild cases of OMG or as adjunctive symptomatic treatment for moderate or severe OMG. The dosing regimen and side-effect profile for pyridostigmine is the same for patients with GMG and OMG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppressive agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinicians prefer to reserve immunosuppressive treatment for patients with more severe disease than that manifested by pure OMG. However, in order to achieve resolution of ptosis or ophthalmoparesis, patients with OMG usually require immunosuppression. Many patients are not satisfied with eye patching, prism lenses, or nonpharmacologic therapy (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic management of ptosis and diplopia'</a> above) and prefer immunosuppression despite the known risks.</p><p>There are retrospective, but no prospective, data, which indicate that immunosuppressive treatment of OMG may decrease the likelihood of developing GMG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/48,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50-52</a>]. It is not clear from these studies whether treatment actually reduces the incidence of GMG, delays its onset, or just masks its symptoms. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Plasmapheresis and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> are used for the short-term management of severe GMG and have no role in patients with OMG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Prednisone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used immunosuppressive agent for the treatment of myasthenia is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. However, the use of corticosteroids in OMG is somewhat controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. In making a decision to use corticosteroids in OMG, clinicians and patients must balance the severity of their symptoms, the efficacy of nonpharmacologic measures (eg, ptosis tape to elevate the eyelid and patching to eliminate diplopia), with the difficulty in weaning prednisone in some patients and the side effects associated with corticosteroid therapy. Also, 10 percent of patients with OMG will have spontaneous remission without corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of corticosteroids was demonstrated in a case series of 55 patients with OMG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> produced symptom resolution at one month in about 70 percent that was sustained over a two-year follow-up period. Another observational study of 35 patients found that ocular symptoms were more likely to resolve with corticosteroids than with anticholinesterase treatment (70 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>In addition to symptomatic benefit, there are some studies that suggest that treatment with corticosteroids may reduce the progression to GMG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/50,51,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51,56-58</a>]. As an example, in one retrospective study, 56 patients with OMG were assessed at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. At that time, only 3 of the 27 prednisone-treated patients had generalized disease compared with 10 of the 29 pyridostigmine-only treated patients.</p><p>Neurologic worsening with initiation of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is less common in patients with OMG than with GMG. Nonetheless, starting with lower doses and gradually increasing over three to four weeks is recommended, as some patients may have unrecognized GMG. Maximum daily doses of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of prednisone are often needed for several weeks (occasionally months) in order to maintain benefit.</p><p>There is no single recommended dosing regimen. Because of the problematic side effects of chronic corticosteroid use, tapering to the lowest effective dose is essential after initial resolution and stabilization of symptoms. Low maintenance doses (5 to 10 mg every other day) are often effective in OMG, but response is highly variable. Alternate-day dosing is preferred.

These agents can also be used with prednisone in order to taper or wean off of prednisone. The side effects of these medications often limit their use for patients with OMG, but they may be necessary to control symptoms and may be preferred by patients if they do not experience major side effects. While observational studies suggest that azathioprine reduces the risk of progression to GMG, further studies are required to confirm this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/51,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,58,59</a>]. Serious risks, such as lymphoma with azathioprine and renal toxicity with cyclosporine, must be weighed against symptom severity in individual patients.

Remission rates of 57 to 71 percent over more than five years have been reported after thymectomy in OMG patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. In addition, no patients in two series of 96 total patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/61,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,65</a>], and only one in a series of 61 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], developed GMG after thymectomy. This contrasts with the expected 50 percent generalization rate over this time frame.</p><p>Prospective, controlled trials are needed to determine if this is a reproducible beneficial effect of thymectomy in OMG.

Recurrence of ptosis for patients who do not demonstrate stability prior to surgery is common due to the nature of myasthenia. The optimal duration of stability prior to surgery is unknown, although there are some indications that three to four years of stability prior to ptosis repair is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Similar to the situation for ptosis, recurrence of diplopia for patients who do not demonstrate stability prior to surgery is common. The optimal duration of stability prior to surgery is unknown; shorter durations of stability (five to six months) prior to strabismus surgery are advocated compared with ptosis surgery, but follow-up data on these patients are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].
