In general, any value over 6.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> should be treated as an emergency. Of course, the basis for any elevation of her potassium level must be sought. The potassium value must be repeated immediately, and an electrocardiogram taken to determine whether there is evidence of toxicity, such as peaked T waves or prolongation of the QRS interval.</p><p>While the therapeutic approach selected was successful one year ago, the circumstances are different this time. The blood glucose level is not nearly as high as it was at that time. Also, the patient has not been seen in nearly a year. It is possible that other factors contribute to the hyperkalemia this time. Further assessment is needed.</p><p>Return to the previous choice to try again.
