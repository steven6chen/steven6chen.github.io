When the common name &quot;brown recluse spider&quot; is used here, it refers only to the one species, <em>L. reclusa</em>, which is widespread and commonly found in homes in the indigenous Central Midwestern United States.</p><p><em>Loxosceles</em> spiders have gained notoriety in the medical literature and lay press because their bites sometimes become necrotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, this is a relatively uncommon sequela, and is largely limited to areas of the United States where these spiders are endemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56537\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56537 \">figure 1</a>). Outside of these regions, the vast majority of necrotic skin lesions are caused by other disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Appearance and identification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recluse spiders are rather nondescript brown spiders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70229\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70229 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79463 \">picture 2</a>). The most accurate method of identifying a recluse spider involves counting the eyes. Most spiders have eight eyes in two rows of four. In contrast, recluse spiders have six eyes, with a pair in front, a pair on both sides, and a gap between the pairs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60968\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60968 \">picture 3</a>). With the naked eye or low magnification, the eye pairs (dyads) may appear as individual eyespots.</p><p>Identifying a recluse spider on the basis of body markings is less reliable. The brown recluse is described as having a violin pattern on its anterior cephalothorax, although this has led to widespread misidentification of common, harmless spiders as brown recluse when the dark markings on spiders' bodies are mistakenly interpreted as violins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Additionally, the violin marking is absent in many juvenile and recently-molted brown recluses as well as in some southwestern recluse species. Other features of recluse spiders include monochromatic legs, a monochromatic abdomen, and fine hairs (but not conspicuous spines) on the legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79463 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>The most common spider mistaken for <em>Loxosceles</em> in the United States is <em>Kukulcania</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64635\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64635 \">picture 4</a>), which has a darkened pattern on the cephalothorax near the eyes of the tan males that can be mistaken for a violin pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Female <em>Kukulcania</em> are black or dark brown, velvety in texture, and resemble small tarantulas, although people still mistake them for brown recluse spiders. <em>Kukulcania</em> spiders are found in the southern third of the United States from the San Francisco Bay through southern California, east through Texas to Florida and north to North Carolina and Virginia. They are frequently found in homes, although verified bites from these spiders are virtually unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are over 110 <em>Loxosceles</em> species in the world, although only a few have extensive distributions and also exist where humans live. Most species are found in North and South America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Recluse bites are rare elsewhere, although they have been reported in South Africa and Australia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, recluse spiders are found in limited areas of the South, West, and Midwest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56537\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56537 \">figure 1</a>) and rarely outside these endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The brown recluse, <em>L. reclusa</em>, is the most widespread and the best known of North American recluse spiders. It is a <strong>synanthropic</strong> spider (ie, its population numbers increase in association with humans) and these spiders are commonly encountered within homes in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In South America, <em>Loxosceles</em> spiders of medical importance are found in Brazil and Chile. The most common species involved in envenomations are <em>L. laeta, L. intermedia</em>, and <em>L. gaucho</em>. <em>Loxosceles laeta</em> is often considered the most dangerous of the recluse spiders, in part because it is the species that attains the largest body size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Mediterranean recluse, <em>L. rufescens</em>, has been transported around the world and continues to establish isolated populations inside buildings on many continents. It has been found in many American cities, where these spiders tend to develop dense populations within isolated buildings. However, despite these infestations, verified bites from Mediterranean recluse are exceedingly rare.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Habitat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recluses are found mostly inside homes (eg, basements, attics, behind bookshelves and dressers, and in cupboards). As their name implies, these spiders prefer dark, quiet areas that are rarely disturbed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049 \">table 1</a>). Out of doors, they are found under objects, such as rocks or the bark of dead trees.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF BITES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loxoscelism is the term for the medical manifestations of bites by recluse spiders. In this review, the term is used to refer to both local and systemic symptoms resulting from bites, although toxicologists sometimes use the term to refer exclusively to the systemic symptoms.</p><p>The literature pertaining to loxoscelism is in general inadequate because of the lack of documentation of a proven spider bite, which is the proven presence of the culprit spider in the vicinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Reports of larger series of patients carrying the diagnosis of loxoscelism only have proven bites in 7 to 14 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Venom properties</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Loxosceles</em> venom contains a large number of enzymes and biologically active substances, of which sphingomyelinase D is the most important. This enzyme is unique in nature to <em>Loxosceles </em>and its sister genus, <em>Sicarius</em>, but is absent in all other spiders including other closely related haplogyne spiders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Sphingomyelinase is believed responsible for skin necrosis and the systemic manifestations of <em>Loxosceles</em> envenomation. It activates complement, induces neutrophil chemotaxis, induces apoptosis of keratinocytes and other cells, and initiates the generation of potent collagen and elastin-degrading metalloproteinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recluse spiders (like most spiders) typically bite humans only as a desperate last line of defense as they are being crushed between flesh and some object. This happens most frequently indoors, as a result of rolling over on the spider in bed or putting on clothing or footwear that has been left in closets or on the floor, in which the spider has sought refuge.</p><p>Recluse spider bites typically occur on the upper arm, thorax, or inner thigh. Bites on the hands or face (ie, uncovered areas) are rare.</p><p>Recluse bites can be sustained out of doors, although these spiders are not known to be found in living vegetation. Patients reporting a painful bite while reaching into living foliage are more likely to have sustained an insect sting or puncture by thorns or other sharp plant matter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Findings following bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms may be divided into local signs at the bite site, skin necrosis, and, less commonly systemic effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Local effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial bite of a <em>Loxosceles</em> spider is usually painless, although they can occasionally be painful or cause a burning sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The site can sometimes be identified by two small cutaneous puncture marks with surrounding erythema. The bite is usually a red plaque (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71174 \">picture 5</a>) or papule, which often develops central pallor. Occasionally, vesiculation around the site may occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96172\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96172 \">picture 6</a>). The pain typically increases over the next two to eight hours, and may become severe. In most cases, this lesion is self-limited and resolves without further complications in approximately one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, in some patients, the lesion will develop a dark, depressed center over the ensuing 24 to 48 hours, culminating in a dry eschar that subsequently ulcerates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96173\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96173 \">picture 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1508243361\" class=\"local\">'Necrosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients develop urticaria or a morbilliform rash in the hours after the bite; this has been suggested by some as evidence of a prior bite, although the phenomenon has not been studied formally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1508243361\"><span class=\"h4\">Necrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts in the past have estimated that approximately 10 percent of recluse spider bites become necrotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. However, many necrotic skin lesions are erroneously attributed to spider bites. Thus, the true frequency of skin necrosis after a bite is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The progression of necrosis from a recluse spider bite typically occurs over several days. The original papule or plaque develops a dusky red or blue color in the center of the lesion, and a dry, depressed center may herald necrosis. There may be anesthesia in the center. An eschar forms and subsequently breaks down to form an ulcer. The lesion may enlarge in a gravitational manner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96174 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A fully developed necrotic lesion is usually 1 to 2 cm in diameter, although skin loss can be more extensive and ulcers as large as 40 cm or more have rarely been described. These most typically occur over fatty tissue on the buttocks and thighs.</p><p>Lesions usually stop extending within 10 days of the bite, and most lesions heal by secondary intent over several weeks, without scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96175\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96175 \">picture 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Some necrotic lesions take months to heal fully. Permanent scarring or requirement for surgical repair is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Dermal necrosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic symptoms are an infrequent complication of recluse bites, and do not correlate with local findings. The following nonspecific signs and symptoms may appear over several days following a recluse bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malaise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myalgias</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H995149453\"><span class=\"h4\">Life-threatening effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rare complications following a recluse spider bite include angioedema, acute hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis, myonecrosis, renal failure, coma, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. The risk of these complications from <em>Loxosceles</em> bites is extremely low in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins#H2923278528\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic anemia due to drugs and toxins&quot;, section on 'Insect, spider, and snake bites'</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, these complications are more common with loxoscelism from the South American species <em>L. laeta</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3578376594\" class=\"local\">'South American recluse spider bites'</a> below.)</p><p>Based upon small case series, <em>Loxosceles</em> bites can be very severe in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; however, the literature is not clear on the frequency of complications because of reporting ambiguities and lack of documentation of the actual culprit spider.</p><p>One retrospective case series from the southern United States reported 26 children with the diagnosis of recluse spider bite at discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. All had an admission diagnosis of cellulitis and documentation was not clear on how the discharge diagnosis was confirmed. In three cases, a &quot;spider&quot; was seen. Clinical findings included 22 patients with skin necrosis with 3 patients developing total desquamation several days after the bite, 13 who developed hemolytic anemia, 7 with rhabdomyolysis, and 3 with progression to acute renal failure. There was a bimodal peak for hemolysis at days 2 through 3 and days 4 through 9. Five patients required management in an intensive care unit. Therapy was supportive, and there were no deaths.</p><p>In a case report of a suspected recluse spider bite in a six-year-old child, profound hemolysis (hemoglobin &lt;2.0) and vascular collapse developed but responded to nine single-volume plasma exchanges, aggressive transfusions, inotropes, and mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Unexplained severe hemolysis in an indigenous area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56537\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56537 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049 \">table 1</a>) may suggest a surreptitious <em>Loxosceles</em> envenomation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There are rare reports of death in small children occurring within 24 hours of a presumed recluse spider bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/26,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of a spider bite is most often based on the history of feeling a bite and clinical presentation of a wound that may be necrotic. An assay for <em>Loxosceles</em> venom has been developed but is not commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Of note, the diagnosis of a spider bite can be considered definitive only if the patient has a consistent skin lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71174 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96172\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96172 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96174 \">picture 8</a>) and both of the following criteria are fulfilled:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A spider was observed inflicting the bite.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spider was recovered, collected, and properly identified by an expert entomologist.</p><p/><p>If both of the above conditions are not met, then other conditions such as vasculitis, infection, vascular problems, or other relevant disorders must be excluded.</p><p>Because systemic effects may precede skin findings, a working diagnosis of recluse spider bite may be made for children with acute hemolysis of unknown etiology in regions where the recluse spider is found. However, other etiologies for acute, severe hemolytic anemia must also be excluded.

They are nondescript brown spiders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70229\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70229 \">picture 1</a>) that can be more reliably identified by their distinctive eye pattern (three pairs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60968\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60968 \">picture 3</a>). They are found mostly in certain parts of North and South America. In the United States, recluse spiders are limited to areas of the South, West, and Midwest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56537\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56537 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Entomology of recluse spiders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recluse spider bites are usually sustained indoors, as a result of rolling over on the spider in bed or putting on clothing or footwear in which the spider has sought refuge. These spiders are not aggressive and generally bite humans only when being crushed between flesh and some object. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Habitat'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients presenting with possible spider bites should always be questioned carefully regarding the circumstances surrounding the bite. Other disorders are responsible for most lesions attributed to spider bites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64314 \">table 2</a>), unless the patient witnessed the spider inflicting the bite and can retrieve the spider for identification by an entomologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected spider bite: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loxoscelism is the term for the medical manifestations of bites by recluse spiders. The initial bite of a <em>Loxosceles</em> spider is typically painless, although some patients describe sharp pain or burning. The bite is usually a red plaque (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71174 \">picture 5</a>), which can sometimes be identified by two small cutaneous puncture marks with surrounding erythema. In most cases, this lesion is self-limited and resolves without further complications. Patients with clinical manifestations limited to local effects do not require laboratory evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Local effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H458844197\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The progression of necrosis from a recluse spider bite typically occurs over several days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96173\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96173 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96174 \">picture 8</a>). These generally heal by secondary intent over several weeks, without scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96175\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96175 \">picture 9</a>). Treatment consists of cleansing of the bite site, analgesia for mild to moderate pain, and tetanus prophylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 7</a>), as needed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Local effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Wound care and general measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For bites by recluse spiders, other than South American species, we suggest that patients with dermal necrosis receive only symptomatic and supportive wound care; no antivenom exists for these species and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> should be avoided. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Dermal necrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> performing early surgical excision <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> curettage of a necrotic lesion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, once the lesion is demarcated and clinically stable, debridement and wound care may permit better healing. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Dermal necrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with presumed spider bites by <em>Loxosceles gaucho</em>, <em>L. laeta</em>, and <em>L. intermedia</em> (ie, species indigenous to Brazil, Chile, and Peru) who have systemic findings at any time after a bite or who have moderate to severe dermal necrosis and present for care within 48 hours receive antivenom (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Consultation with a physician experienced with the management of bites by South American recluse spiders is encouraged prior to the administration of antivenom. (See <a href=\"#H3578376594\" class=\"local\">'South American recluse spider bites'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic toxicity may appear over several days following a bite and include malaise, nausea and vomiting, fever, and myalgias. Patients with systemic findings warrant ancillary studies as suggested in the topic. Systemic toxicity is more common in small children than adults. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Systemic findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H458844197\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3498594406\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital admission is indicated for patients with signs of hemolytic anemia, rhabdomyolysis, or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. For bites by species other than South American recluse spiders, treatment is condition-specific and is primarily supportive. (See <a href=\"#H2448185255\" class=\"local\">'Acute hemolytic anemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H180328976\" class=\"local\">'Rhabdomyolysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3032594511\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bites-of-recluse-spiders/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Macchiavello, A.
