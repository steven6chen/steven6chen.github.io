Efforts to improve adolescent health through access to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention education must take into account the developmental level of the patient, as well as social and psychological variables.</p><p>Issues surrounding HIV infections vary widely between adolescents in developing countries and those in the developed world. This topic will principally review, within the developed world, the epidemiology of and risk factors for HIV infection among adolescents, strategies to provide services to adolescents, and age-specific recommendations for initiating treatment. Other aspects of pediatric and adolescent HIV infection are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of pediatric HIV infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric HIV infection: Classification, clinical manifestations, and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H578409560\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are unique challenges to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV infection among adolescents. A comprehensive program for adolescents at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection must include efforts at preventing infection (such as outreach programs), easily accessible testing, and counseling. Programs that have been successful are peer oriented and target specific high-risk behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/index.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsbSOkPHp5P1x+KSK1/xgSWcILJYksizXXuMLwB2UsYC5g/TC14yImTzsZ6gjPWTjcA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6007\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) provides guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Specific issues that should be addressed with adolescents include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reason for testing &ndash; The adolescent who has recently engaged in a high-risk activity must understand the importance of retesting in six months.

Since the impact of a positive test is dramatic, we encourage adolescents to consider who they would rely on for support if the test is positive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention &ndash; Given that adolescents are less likely than adults to return for their HIV test results, it is important to help the adolescent develop a personal protection plan that is independent of HIV status.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the number of cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is increasing among adolescents and young adults (aged 13 to 24 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In 2009, approximately 7 percent of all persons with HIV were between 13 and 24 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Adolescents and young adults accounted for approximately one-fourth of new HIV infections in 2010.</p><p>Among adolescents, a disproportionate number of infected individuals are from minority groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77548\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77548 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Approximately one-third of new infections in adolescents occur in females (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55634 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>In addition to <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> and gender, sexual behavior is associated with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The predominant mode of acquisition of HIV among adolescents and young adults is high-risk sexual behaviors (ie, male-to-male sexual contact and heterosexual contact with a person known to have or to be at high risk for HIV infection) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76228 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Young black men who have sex with men (MSM) are at particular risk for HIV infection. <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> cases among black MSM (aged 13 to 24 years) increased 93 percent from 2001 to 2006. These cases are clustered in the southern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The risk of HIV acquisition among young black MSM is increased among those who have sex with partners older than themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The absolute number of vertically infected adolescents is increasing in developed countries. Data from New York City indicate that the percentage of vertically infected children who were nine years of age or older increased from 5 percent to 25 percent between 1989-1991 and 1995-1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The survival of these children to adolescence represents the success of antiretroviral therapy and aggressive prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic infections. This trend should not persist, however, since the similar success of perinatal antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically decreased the incidence of vertical transmission. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Vertically infected adolescents'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biologic, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors that contribute to the risk among adolescents for acquiring sexually transmitted diseases are the same as those for becoming infected with HIV and are discussed elsewhere. Factors that may be more specific for risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection include homelessness, incarceration, having an HIV-infected parent, and history of other sexually transmitted diseases (particularly multiple episodes of gonorrhea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING AND TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive program for adolescents at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection must include efforts at preventing infection (such as outreach programs), easily accessible testing, and counseling. At-risk adolescents may be among the least likely to seek testing or be engaged in routine preventive health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. In national surveillance, only 13 percent of high school students in the United States were tested for HIV in 2009 and 2011 and nearly 60 percent of youth (13 to 24 years of age) with HIV infection are unaware of their diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17</a>].

The Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine also supports offering HIV testing as part of routine care for sexually active adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that routine HIV screening be offered at least once to all adolescents (whether or not they report sexual activity) by 16 to 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. For adolescents at high risk (eg, multiple sex partners, illicit drug use), annual HIV testing is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection#H25116806\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;, section on 'Consent'</a>.)</p><p>Among infected adolescents, testing may decrease high-risk behavior and help improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing reduces high-risk sexual behaviors when implemented with client-centered prevention counseling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early initiation of treatment is associated with improved outcomes. Although they may be asymptomatic, most HIV-positive youth initiating treatment already have moderate immune dysfunction (often related to missed opportunities for diagnosis). The response to treatment is more robust among youth with moderate immunosuppression than with severe immunosuppression.</p><p/><p>Once the adolescent has requested or agreed to HIV testing, systems must be in place to encourage prevention strategies, provide counseling, and (if necessary) initiate treatment. Guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral have been developed by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/index.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsbSOkPHp5P1x+KSK1/xgSWcILJYksizXXuMLwB2UsYC5g/TC14yImTzsZ6gjPWTjcA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6007\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> for all patients, including adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This comprehensive document includes standard counseling and testing procedures that emphasize an HIV prevention model. The guidelines are evidence based, designed to be flexible, and include a quality improvement component. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-test counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre-test counseling is a critical facet of HIV testing for all patients, particularly adolescents. This encounter will be an opportunity to educate the teen and to lay the groundwork for therapy, if indicated. The following issues need to be addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Reason for testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many adolescents seek testing within 24 hours of risky behavior. In this setting, it is particularly important for the adolescent to understand the need to retest if this initial test is negative. Another common reason adolescents seek testing is that they have already been given a positive test result, but are seeking confirmation. Detailed discussions surrounding the timing of HIV testing and confirmation testing are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection#H3828426\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;, section on 'Tests'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H18410709\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Comorbidities and resources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many HIV-infected adolescents have psychological comorbidities that have contributed to high-risk behaviors and will affect their ability to comply with complex treatment regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Information regarding social and economic support systems will be essential to developing successful treatment and prevention plans. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Privacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under the laws in the United States, adolescents generally can seek testing and treatment of any sexually transmitted illness (including HIV) without the permission of their parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, since a positive HIV test will permanently alter a patient's life, we encourage patients to consider who they would rely on for support in the event that the test is positive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The counseling session is a precious educational opportunity. In advance of testing, all adolescents are encouraged to develop a personal protection plan that outlines the steps the patient will take to reduce risk behavior in the future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guidelines for adolescent preventive services&quot;, section on 'Step 4: Solutions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections#H908275850\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Risk reduction counseling'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-test counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, the person who initially counseled the adolescent also will give the test results. Results should be revealed in a secure, private setting. The adolescent should be given time to react to the news, whether good or bad. The meaning of the result should be explained again, emphasizing the need for re-testing if there has been any recent high-risk behavior.</p><p>Adolescents whose tests are negative should be encouraged to follow their personal protection plan. Referral for additional services may be useful.</p><p>Adolescents with a positive test should have prompt follow-up. In addition, the patient often will need assistance with disclosure to trusted adults <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> partners. In many states, anonymous partner notification is available through the public health system.</p><p>Disclosure of HIV status to the patient and peers is a complex issue. Handling disclosure to social contacts, including sexual partners, is complicated by fear of rejection and isolation and also requires support from health care providers.</p><p>Assessment, Counseling, Testing, Support (ACTS) is an example of a testing protocol designed to address these essential components in an urban adolescent AIDS program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. This streamlined system is based on the CDC guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It includes a short counseling session, described below, and relies on referral for additional services, particularly for patients whose test is positive for HIV.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>ssessment &ndash; Provides education, identifies risk factors for HIV infection, and provides recommendations for testing, prevention, and referral.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C</strong>ounseling &ndash; Clarifies the meaning of a positive and negative result.

It is also helpful if the patient has established a connection with the clinic staff and has confidence in his or her own ability to successfully complete a clinic visit.</p><p>Many of our patients come to clinic for educational sessions and general medical care for several months prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART).

For patients who are HIV positive, support groups can be helpful in allowing them to deal with the complex feelings of having a chronic illness. Confidentiality may be an initial concern. One possible solution is to begin the support group as a conference call.

Sexually transmitted infections are common in HIV-infected patients given shared routes of transmission and can be associated with considerable morbidity.

Those who are taking antiretroviral agents can develop physical stigmata such as fat accumulation in the trunk and breasts, and fat loss in the face and extremities. This further complicates their self-image issues.</p><p>Some vertically infected adolescents may only learn of their diagnosis during adolescence and may be suffering from depression associated with this new understanding. Some data suggest that gradual and partial disclosure to the child at an age-appropriate level, with consistent support from a multidisciplinary team of providers, improves adjustment to and acceptance of illness and does not decrease quality of life in perinatally infected youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adolescent-with-hiv-infection/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Serious illness or death of the affected parent may be another difficult adjustment for the adolescent.</p><p>Other general factors to consider include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most have been treated with many different antiretroviral medications.
