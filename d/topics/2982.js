In such cases, carotid baroreceptor stimulation (eg, mechanical forces such as may occur with turning of the neck or looking upward) results in vagal activation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sympathetic inhibition. CSH is not a clinical diagnosis per se but is a potential cause for symptoms in some patients. </p><p>CSH tends to be observed mainly in older individuals (predominantly males) who have atherosclerotic vascular disease. However, CSH may also be observed in individuals who have acquired abnormalities of the structure of the neck (eg, prior neck surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irradiation) or tumors in the region of the carotid sinuses. CSH is a relatively common observation but only an infrequent cause of symptoms. Thus, CSH does not require treatment unless it is deemed to be causing symptoms, resulting in a condition termed carotid sinus syndrome (CSS).</p><p>CSH and CSS will be reviewed here. Other types of reflex syncope, including vasovagal syncope, as well as general discussions of the pathogenesis, etiology, and evaluation of syncope, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults and adolescents: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3491581588\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is not a universally accepted definition of what constitutes an abnormal response to carotid baroreceptor stimulation, resulting in <strong>carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH)</strong>. The most commonly accepted definition is presented in the 2017 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/Heart</span> Rhythm Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/HRS)</span> syncope guidelines, which consider an abnormal value to be heart rate (HR) pauses &gt;3 seconds and a drop of systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt;50 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>However, others believe that the scientific basis for these criteria is unclear and that the criteria are too sensitive and nonspecific. It has been therefore proposed that cerebral hypoperfusion for &gt;5 seconds with the patient in an upright position be utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Our experts agree that this is a more appropriate criterion, but regardless of the chosen definition, it is paramount to observe changes in HR and BP. (See <a href=\"#H2245979732\" class=\"local\">'Test results'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast to CSH, there is general consensus in the definition of <strong>carotid sinus syndrome (CSS)</strong>, which reflects the symptoms (eg, lightheadedness, syncope, etc) that directly result from CSH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4263081206\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSH is a laboratory <span class=\"nowrap\">observation/physical</span> finding, not a clinical syndrome; it appears to be common, occurring in 14 percent in one prospective series of unselected syncope patients and in up to 50 percent of patients with syncope unexplained by initial screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Consequently, the presence of CSH alone, without symptoms, is inadequate to establish a diagnosis basis for symptoms. Reproduction of symptoms by carotid sinus massage provides more solid evidence of a correlation with symptoms and is suggestive of CSS. However, older people are more likely to have this response even if they do not clearly have symptoms due to CSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8</a>].</p><p>CSS as a cause of syncope is relatively rare, accounting for only approximately 1 percent of syncope cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3511079809\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The carotid baroreceptors, specialized tissues sensitive to mechanical pressure, are located bilaterally approximately at the bifurcation of the carotid arteries. These baroreceptors are physiologically important for blood pressure and to a lesser extent heart rate control, acting through a reflex arc which incorporates afferent signals to the cardiovascular control centers in the midbrain and efferent pathways to the heart and peripheral blood vessels. Hypersensitivity of the carotid sinus reflex arc may occur in some persons. </p><p>The carotid sinus reflex arc is composed of an afferent limb arising from mechanoreceptors in the internal carotid artery and terminating in the vagal nucleus and the vasomotor center in the medulla. The efferent limb has two components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Innervation of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular (AV) nodes via the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic ganglia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of sympathetic nervous tone to the heart and blood vessels.</p><p/><p>The site of the abnormality that causes the hypersensitive response in patients with CSH has not been established. Arguments have been made for several possibilities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased responsiveness of the peripheral receptors themselves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased responsiveness of the baroreceptor region due to comorbidities such as atherosclerotic vascular disease, nearby neck surgery, or irradiation that alters the receptor milieu.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal proprioception responses in nearby neck muscles that modify the manner in which central sites interpret baroreceptor afferent signals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased responsiveness of midbrain reflex sites.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSH is a clinical observation of heart rate (HR) pauses and drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) but is not inherently a clinical condition requiring treatment. CSS reflects the spontaneous clinical manifestation of CSH when changes in HR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> BP cause symptoms, most commonly syncope or lightheadedness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1282454151\"><span class=\"h2\">Carotid sinus hypersensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSH, most commonly identified as a pause duration of &gt;3 seconds or drop in BP &gt;50 mmHg during carotid sinus massage, may or may not be associated with symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, as with the debate over the definition of CSH, there are several reasons these criteria are inadequately sensitive and specific, most notably:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms are unlikely to be induced by a three-second pause, and a pause as long as six to nine seconds is sometimes necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vasodilation component of the reflex is disregarded (ie, hypotension may occur with marked bradycardia). </p><p/><p>One examination of diagnostic criteria suggests that when carotid sinus massage is used as part of the overall diagnostic evaluation of syncope of unknown cause, an induced pause or cerebral hypotension duration of &gt;5 seconds is a more reasonable diagnostic standard in the absence of an alternative cause for symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H2865470772\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Carotid sinus massage'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3013168893\"><span class=\"h2\">Carotid sinus syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSS may present with a variety of symptoms following carotid baroreceptor stimulation, but one or more of the following are most common: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Lightheadedness/presyncope</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otherwise unexplained falls</p><p/><p>Risk factors such as older age, male gender, concomitant atherosclerotic disease, prior neck surgery, or irradiation should increase suspicion. CSS is diagnosed when, by history, spontaneous syncope symptoms can be reasonably attributed to mechanical manipulation of the carotid sinuses. Unfortunately, obtaining a clear history of carotid sinus stimulation is challenging and uncommon. Symptoms including syncope may be reproduced by carotid sinus massage, but while such demonstration can be of greatest value in establishing CSS as the diagnosis, it is often not possible. Reproduction of symptoms may be better achieved if carotid sinus massage is undertaken with the patient in an upright position. The latter is most safely accomplished with the patient gently secured on a tilt table so the patient can be prevented from falling. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>When CSS manifests as true syncope, it is commonly termed carotid sinus syncope, a type of reflex syncope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An overview of the diagnostic approach to lightheadedness, near-syncope, and syncope in general is provided elsewhere.

The diagnostic yield of carotid sinus massage may be increased by performing the massage during head-up tilt testing as this allows for inducing a greater degree of hypotension and is therefore more likely to reproduce symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a report of 1149 patients over 55 years of age presenting with unexplained syncope, CSH provoked by carotid sinus massage was seen in 223 patients (19 percent); in one-third of these patients, a response to carotid sinus massage was elicited during tilt table testing after a negative response to supine massage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The disagreement mainly focuses on the length of the HR pause that is considered abnormal. </p><p>The test is generally considered positive in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive for CSH following induction of either a pause &gt;3 seconds (with some experts preferring &gt;5 seconds) <strong>OR</strong> a drop of systolic blood pressure &gt;50 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive for CSS if symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope arise.</p><p/><p>The response to carotid sinus massage is generally classified as cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor, or mixed. In most cases, the response is &quot;mixed,&quot; indicating that symptoms in patients with CSS are a combination of HR slowing and vasodilation. The combination is a typical feature of all reflex faints such as vasovagal syncope. A positive response to carotid sinus massage may be considered diagnostic of the cause of syncope if other competing diagnoses can be reasonably excluded by history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"#H2771192187\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>CSH is more common in older adult patient populations. Carotid sinus massage may unmask CSH in older adult patients, but this should not automatically be deemed a diagnostic finding in patients with lightheadedness, syncope, or falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In an unselected sample of 272 older adult patients (mean age 71 years) from a community practice who underwent carotid sinus massage in both the supine and upright positions, CSH was present in 39 percent overall and in 35 percent of individuals with no prior falls, syncope, or dizziness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, alternative causes should be explored before attributing syncope to CSH in older adult patients. Some have advocated using stricter criteria for identification of CSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2771192187\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><strong>CSH</strong> is identified based on a heart rate (HR) pause duration of &gt;3 seconds (some prefer &gt;5 seconds, as discussed above) or drop in blood pressure (BP) &gt;50 mmHg during carotid sinus massage.</p><p><strong>CSS</strong> is diagnosed by the combination of appropriate spontaneous symptoms and documented CSH following carotid sinus massage. When CSH is documented following carotid sinus massage, concurrent symptoms provide the most convincing evidence for CSS. An asymptomatic &quot;positive&quot; response for CSH is less sensitive and less specific than reproduction of symptoms, particularly if a full evaluation for other causes of syncope has not yet been performed. (See <a href=\"#H2245979732\" class=\"local\">'Test results'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By history, spontaneous syncope symptoms can be reasonably attributed to mechanical manipulation of the carotid sinuses resulting in CSH. CSS symptoms are deemed to result from CSH-induced excessive and inappropriate cardioinhibition (ie, slowing of HR) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasodilation, yielding a drop in BP. Both cardioinhibition and vasodilation transiently diminished brain perfusion. Elements of both cardioinhibition and vasodilation (ie, &quot;mixed response&quot;) are usually present and contribute to symptoms.</p><p>CSS is one of many potential causes for these symptoms. The diagnosis of CSS depends on suspicion after obtaining a very careful medical history. Rarely is a clear-cut relationship established between neck movements and symptom episodes. Nonetheless, although it is rarely present, a history of syncope following accidental manipulation of the carotid sinuses should be sought. Absence of such a history does not exclude CSS. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p>The finding of CSH in older adult patients should not be construed as diagnostic for the presenting symptoms (ie, lightheadedness, syncope, falls) unless other causes of the symptoms have been eliminated or the history clearly relates symptoms to neck movement or mechanical distortion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3233720246\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In regard to pathophysiology, carotid sinus syncope is similar, in terms of cardioinhibition and vasodilation components, to vasovagal syncope; both are classified as forms of reflex syncope. However, precipitating factors for these two types of reflex syncope differ. Carotid sinus syncope (and CSS in general) is attributed to mechanical stress on hypersensitive carotid baroreceptors whereas vasovagal syncope is most often triggered by emotional events, painful stimuli, or prolonged upright posture. Other reflex faints (eg, defecation syncope, swallow syncope, trumpet blowers syncope) may also need to be considered depending on the specific circumstances of the patient presentation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>A full discussion of the differential diagnosis of syncope in adults is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of patients with CSH is directed by the presence or absence of symptoms. Permanent cardiac pacing is the appropriate therapy for many patients with CSS and an abnormal cardioinhibitory response following cardiac massage. Vasoconstrictor drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a>) may also be needed in a minority of cases. Additional restrictions should be placed on driving until appropriate treatment has been provided. Conversely, patients with isolated CSH who remain asymptomatic require no specific therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H490064808\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSS is a multifaceted syndrome in terms of symptoms as well as pathophysiology (ie, cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor components). In addition, symptoms are usually infrequent and sporadic. Consequently, it is important to consider the risks associated with treating the patient every day for prevention of infrequent events.</p><p>Education is an important treatment strategy. Risks of CSS to the patient and bystanders should be discussed in detail. Lightheadedness and near-syncope may not cause frank loss of consciousness but can cause inattention and slow reaction times during operation of vehicles and machinery. The latter promote the chances of accidents and falls with potential for major injury. Syncope may occur with a similar potential for hazard to the patient and others if the patient loses control of a vehicle or other machine or simply falls in a crowded environment. (See <a href=\"#H769975888\" class=\"local\">'Driving restrictions'</a> below.)</p><p>Consequently, general treatment measures include education regarding the nature, risks, and prognosis of the condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67864\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67864 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The patient should be advised to avoid accidental mechanical manipulation of the carotid sinuses such as might occur if they receive medical or chiropractic treatments to the neck area or wear tight collars. </p><p>Relatively little is known of the optimal treatment of patients with a predominant vasodilatory response to carotid sinus massage, as these cases seem to be rare (or at least rarely recognized) and therefore difficult to study. As an initial step, drugs, such as vasodilators, that may exacerbate the condition should be reduced or discontinued, if feasible. Although some therapies for vasovagal syncope (such as salt loading and vasoconstrictors) may be expected to be helpful, such treatments may cause supine hypertension and are usually undesirable in the older patient population with CSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Vasoconstrictive drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droxidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droxidopa</a> are theoretically appealing, but there are no data to support their use. Additionally, vasoconstrictive drugs must be used cautiously to minimize the risk of hypertension. In individuals with CSS and essential hypertension (a common combination), it is necessary to use vasoconstrictors during waking hours and short-acting antihypertensives at bedtime to diminish supine hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3152315800\"><span class=\"h2\">Permanent pacing for symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with CSS (ie, a history of suspected reflex syncope and a positive cardioinhibitory response following carotid sinus massage), we suggest implanting a permanent cardiac pacemaker in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with recurrent syncope believed to be due to CSS with a cardioinhibitory or &quot;mixed&quot; response to carotid sinus massage resulting in asystole for more than three to five seconds. However, a predominant vasodilatory response (drop in systolic blood pressure &gt;50 mmHg) without associated cardioinhibition may be associated with decreased pacemaker effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with recurrent syncope of unexplained origin and a cardioinhibitory response to carotid sinus massage resulting in asystole for more than three to five seconds.

Single-chamber AAI pacing is NOT recommended for patients with CSS, as transient AV block may occur during an episode and eliminate any potential pacing benefit.

As an example, in a study of 18 patients with recurrent syncope and cardioinhibitory response to carotid sinus massage and 36 patients with recurrent syncope and negative response to carotid sinus massage, implantable loop recordings identified the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asystole with syncope in 16 of 18 (89 percent) patients with a positive cardioinhibitory response to carotid sinus massage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asystolic with syncope in 18 of 36 (50 percent) patients with a negative cardioinhibitory response to carotid sinus massage </p><p/><p>In CSS, virtually all studies seem to favor the value of pacing despite the fact that both cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor mechanisms may be operating. This latter observation differs from other reflex conditions such as the vasovagal faint in which a predominant vasodepressor component may undermine the value of pacing therapy. Why these two forms of reflex symptoms are so different is unknown.</p><p>Two small randomized trials found that pacing reduced the rate of syncope recurrence in patients with CSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Dual-chamber pacing is beneficial in patients with CSH who have a cardioinhibitory response, but not in those with a pure vasodilatory response. </p><p>Pacing may prevent nonmechanical falls as well as syncope. This was illustrated in the SAFE PACE trial in which 175 patients seen in an emergency facility because of a nonmechanical fall without loss of consciousness were randomly assigned to a dual-chamber pacemaker or no therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Pacing significantly reduced the mean frequency of falls by 66 percent (4.1 versus 9.3 per year for controls). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a study of 21 patients with CSS and syncope or near-syncope, patients were randomized to VVI, DDDR, or DDDR with a sudden bradycardia response in a double-blinded sequential crossover basis with six months in each mode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There were 29 syncopal and 258 presyncopal events among 21 patients. Following pacing, syncopal events reduced to two in two patients (p&lt;0.001) and 17 presyncopal events (p&lt;0.001) in 12 patients, and these events were not related to the three pacing methods. While these data do not support one specific mode of pacing, some patients do respond to AV sequential pacing better hemodynamically, and if this is known a priori, we suggest a dual-chamber pacemaker be implanted from the start. Failure of pacing most likely would be due to the patient having a prominent vasodepressor component of the CSS reflex,&nbsp;similar&nbsp;to what may happen in patients with vasovagal syncope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1719702954\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific therapy is required for patients with documented CSH without associated symptoms.

Its incidence increases with age. (See <a href=\"#H3491581588\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4263081206\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid sinus massage is recommended as part of the diagnostic workup for patients over age 40 with syncope of unknown etiology without contraindication to carotid sinus pressure. However, false positive results are common in older adults, so other potential causes of syncope should be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General treatment measures include education regarding the risks associated with CSS and its treatment. (See <a href=\"#H490064808\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dual-chamber pacing is often helpful in patients with CSS who are found to have a slow heart rate (HR) or pause in their heart rhythm as a cause of their symptoms. Since the slow HR is only part of the problem, pacing may not be a perfect solution in all individuals. However, it is valuable in most CSS patients. Medications may need to be added to diminish the vasodilatory component for some other patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with recurrent syncope in the setting of a history of spontaneous carotid sinus stimulation, who also have ventricular asystole of more than three seconds in response to carotid sinus pressure, are considered to have been definitively diagnosed with carotid sinus syncope. We recommend that such patients be treated with a permanent pacemaker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with recurrent syncope of unexplained origin and a hypersensitive cardioinhibitory response of longer than three seconds may also have CSS. We suggest placement of a pacemaker in such patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1024748949\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Brian Olshansky, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Shen WK, Sheldon RS, Benditt DG, et al. 2017 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Syncope: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the Heart Rhythm Society.
