These forms of travelers' diarrhea are defined as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic &ndash; Passage of three or more unformed stools in a 24 hour period plus at least one of these other symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps, fever, blood in stools</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; Passage of one or two unformed stools in 24 hours plus at least one of the above symptoms or more than two unformed stools in 24 hours without other symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild &ndash; Passage of one or two unformed stools in 24 hours without other symptoms</p><p/><p>These definitions allow some uniformity in studies of the epidemiology and etiologies of travelers' diarrhea. For such studies, the three types can be grouped together to estimate a total number of cases of travelers' diarrhea.

The classic &quot;turista&quot; due to enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (ETEC) generally produces malaise, anorexia, and abdominal cramps followed by the sudden onset of watery diarrhea. Very frequent stools are uncommon. Nausea and vomiting also may occur. Typically there are no symptoms of colitis such as blood or pus in the stool. Patients may develop a low grade fever. </p><p>As an example, in a prospective study of 390 travelers from the Netherlands to subtropical and tropical regions, 160 (41 percent) reported travelers' diarrhea (defined as three or more unformed stools within a 24 hour period) on post-travel questionnaires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of those with diarrhea, 86 percent reported watery stools, 77 percent abdominal discomfort or cramps, and 71 percent fecal urgency. Twenty percent reported vomiting, and only 11 percent had a fever. Most had three to five stools per day; three percent had &gt;10 stools per day. Ten percent reported only loose stools without accompanying symptoms. </p><p>While it is common to be unable to proceed with planned activities, only a minority of patients report requiring bedrest for one to two days. In a series of 30,369 travelers to Jamaica, among whom the attack rate for travelers' diarrhea was 24 percent, incapacity was reported for a mean of 11.6 hours from the illness onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1720002444\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms associated with specific etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even when other bacterial agents such as <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> and <em>Shigella</em> spp are implicated, the symptoms initially experienced by the traveler are generally similar to those seen with ETEC. However, infections with these organisms may progress to include symptoms of colitis, such as fever, tenesmus, urgency, cramping, and bloody diarrhea.

The symptoms of microsporidiosis may be more subtle with bloating and intermittent diarrhea.

The illness is generally self-limited with symptoms lasting for approximately one to five days. However, 8 to 15 percent of patients experience symptoms for more than one week and as many as two percent for more than one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1720002577\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term sequelae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subsequent development of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, and in particular irritable bowel syndrome, has been reported in a sizable minority of patients following travelers' diarrhea.

Management of travelers' diarrhea is often symptomatic and initiated without regard to the specific offending agent. Furthermore, routine stool cultures are rarely informative since ETEC and enteroaggregative <em>E. coli</em> (EAEC) cannot be distinguished from nonpathogenic <em>E. coli</em> on stool culture, and viral agents would not be identified with stool cultures. Culture-independent diagnostic testing, such as antigen-based molecular assays, is available but not yet in routine clinical use; its application may be limited by the identification of multiple potential pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and the lack of associated antibiotic sensitivity testing.</p><p>However, certain features may warrant a specific microbiologic workup that could potentially lead to targeted treatment.

Diarrhea may also occur in the context of systemic infections, such as influenza, HIV infection, dengue fever, and malaria. Other non-infectious food-poisoning syndromes, such as shellfish or mushroom poisoning can cause diarrhea. These other syndromes can be differentiated from simple travelers' diarrhea by the presence of other distinguishing clinical features or specific diagnostic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-fever-in-the-returning-traveler\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of fever in the returning traveler&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of shellfish and pufferfish poisoning&quot;, section on 'Diarrheic shellfish poisoning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning#H21621536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of mushroom poisoning&quot;, section on 'Acute gastroenteritis'</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, new medications may be a cause of acute diarrhea in travelers; comparing the timing of initiation with the onset of diarrhea can help evaluate for this noninfectious etiology of diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037167462\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of travelers' diarrhea depends on the severity of illness. Fluid replacement is an essential component of treatment for all cases of travelers' diarrhea. Most cases are self-limited and resolve on their own within three to five days of treatment with fluid replacement only. Antibiotics and antimotility agents, often used together, may be warranted in certain circumstances. Antimicrobial therapy shortens the disease duration to about one day and antimotility agents may limit symptoms to a period of hours. Antimicrobial choice depends, in part, on the region of travel. The benefit of antibiotics must be weighed against potential risks, including adverse effects and selection for resistant bacteria. These issues are discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382130409\"><span class=\"h2\">When to seek care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Travelers from resource rich settings who develop diarrhea while traveling to resource limited settings generally can treat themselves rather than seek medical advice while traveling. However, medical evaluation may be warranted in patients who develop high fever, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, or vomiting and for whom empiric antibiotics have not been of benefit. Otherwise, for most patients while traveling or after returning home, medical consultation is generally not warranted unless symptoms persist for 10 to 14 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037167468\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary and most important treatment of travelers' (or any other) diarrhea is fluid replacement, since the most significant complication of diarrhea is volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The approach to fluid replacement depends on the severity of the diarrhea and volume depletion. Travelers can use the amount of urine passed as a general guide to their level of volume depletion. If they are urinating regularly, even if the color is dark yellow, the diarrhea and volume depletion are likely mild. If there is a paucity of urine and that small amount is dark yellow, the diarrhea and volume depletion are likely more severe. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild cases &ndash; Patients with mild diarrhea may combine alternating sips of fluids that contain salt and fluids that contain sugar to replete and maintain hydration. Broth, fruit juice, or similar fluids may be used. Pedialyte is frequently useful in children. For mild diarrhea, the use of fluids is the critical factor; the fluid need not be oral rehydration solution. One study showed no difference in outcome between treatment with oral rehydration solution plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> versus generic fluids and loperamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe cases &ndash; Severe diarrhea should be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS); this replaces needed electrolytes in the appropriate concentrations. Packets of oral rehydration solution are available in the pharmacies of most countries and can be mixed with clean drinking water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. ORS should be used until the individual is urinating regularly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, a similar solution can be made by adding <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> teaspoon of salt, <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> teaspoon of baking soda, and 4 tablespoons of sugar to one liter of water. The electrolyte concentrations of fluids used for sweat replacement (eg, Gatorade) are not equivalent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Fluid repletion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-therapy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral rehydration therapy&quot;, section on 'Clinical management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037167564\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal dietary intake during diarrheal illnesses has not been established. Controversy exists about issues such as partial fasting, the composition of the diet, and the time at which solid food intake should be resumed. Ultimately, apart from hydration, diet is not likely to be important, since disease duration is only a few days. The most important intervention for someone with travelers' diarrhea is to maintain hydration. In general, we advise individuals to eat or not as they choose, depending on how hungry they are. Often someone with diarrhea will not feel hungry, but if they do choose to eat, will prefer a bland diet such as rice or toast. </p><p>A restricted diet (eg, beginning with only clear liquids to match diarrheal losses during the acute phase of diarrhea) is often recommended. A randomized trial among healthy American students being treated with antibiotics for travelers' diarrhea in Mexico compared the effects of this restricted diet with an unrestricted diet (in which the only specific recommendation was to match fluid intake to diarrheal losses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The mean duration of diarrhea (37 versus 33 hours) and the course of clinical symptoms were similar in the two groups. The general applicability of these observations is uncertain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037167584\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1720002804\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest not treating most cases of travelers' diarrhea with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment is reasonable for travelers with severe diarrhea, which is characterized by fever and blood, pus, or mucus in the stool, or for travelers with diarrhea that substantially interferes with the purpose of travel. Antibiotic treatment can reduce the duration of travelers' diarrhea from several days to one or two days. However, drawbacks to antibiotics include cost, potential side effects, and promotion of bacterial resistance, which is an increasing concern. The benefit of antibiotics may not outweigh the drawbacks in many individuals with travelers' diarrhea. </p><p>Caution should be used when treating a patient who has grossly bloody diarrhea with antibiotics, particularly if there is no or minimal fever. Although an uncommon cause of travelers' diarrhea, bloody diarrhea can reflect infection with enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em>, for which antibiotic treatment has been associated with an increased risk of hemolytic-uremic syndrome, especially in children.

In general, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or a fluoroquinolone. In particular, azithromycin is the preferred option for pregnant women, children, and for travelers to locations (such as Southeast Asia) where fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens are prevalent.

Antimotility agents can be used alone (ie, without antibiotics) in mild to moderate travelers' diarrhea. For travelers with severe diarrhea, we suggest that antimotility agents (such as loperamide or diphenoxylate) only be taken in conjunction with antibiotics. Furthermore, travelers should be educated about the need to avoid antimotility agents in dysentery (bloody stool <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fevers). Antimotility agents should be stopped if abdominal pain or other symptoms worsen or if the diarrhea continues to be intractable after two days. </p><p>Particular vigilance about hydration is important in patients who take antimotility agents for travelers' diarrhea, as the agents do not kill the pathogen causing the diarrhea or stop the secretory process in the intestine. Patients may be unaware of how much fluid they are losing into their intestine since they are no longer having frequent bowel movements.</p><p>Additionally, there continues to be some concern that antimotility agents can prolong some types of dysenteric illnesses (eg, <em>Shigella</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. While some studies suggest that antimotility drugs can be safely used in dysenteric illnesses as long as they are combined with antibiotic therapy, none of the studies evaluating the benefit of antimotility agents included in a 2008 meta-analysis included patients with bloody diarrhea or symptoms suggestive of dysentery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/38,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,46,47</a>]. </p><p>The antisecretory drug, racecadotril, which is not available in the United States, may be useful in travelers' diarrhea. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1720003020\"><span class=\"h3\">Bismuth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bismuth-subsalicylate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bismuth subsalicylate</a> can also be used to treat the symptoms of diarrhea, although large doses are required.

Specialized staining techniques, such as a modified acid fast or trichome stain, may be required for certain organisms, such as <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>, microsporidia, <em>Cyclospora</em>, and <em>Isospora</em>. Stool antigen testing is also available for some parasites, such as <em>Giardia</em> and <em>Entamoeba</em> spp. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays for identification of a variety of enteropathogens are also available, but interpretation may be confounded by the identification of more than one pathogenic organism.

The illness is generally self-limited with symptoms lasting for approximately one to five days. (See <a href=\"#H1720002432\" class=\"local\">'Classic symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1720002571\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less common symptoms of colitis (tenesmus, urgency, cramping, and bloody diarrhea), belching, or profuse watery diarrhea may reflect other infectious etiologies of travelers' diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H1720002444\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms associated with specific etiologies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of travelers' diarrhea is made in an individual from a resource-rich setting who develops unformed stools during or shortly after returning from travel to a resource-limited setting. Travelers' diarrhea is typically self-diagnosed by the patient. Determination of the infectious agent is generally unnecessary. Microbiologic workup is generally reserved for patients with systemic illness, fever and colitis, prominent upper intestinal symptoms (in whom giardiasis is more likely), and a recent history of antibiotic use. (See <a href=\"#H1037167434\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travelers from resource-rich settings who develop diarrhea while traveling to resource-limited settings generally should treat themselves rather than seek medical advice while traveling. The primary and most important treatment of travelers' (or any other) diarrhea is fluid replacement, since the most significant risk of diarrhea is volume depletion. Fluid replacement can be done with general fluids or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a>, depending on the severity of the illness. (See <a href=\"#H1037167468\" class=\"local\">'Fluid replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic treatment can reduce the duration of travelers' diarrhea from several days to one or two days. However, the benefits of antibiotics should be weighed against the potential risks, including adverse effects and promotion of bacterial resistance. For most individuals with travelers' diarrhea, we suggest not treating with antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Antibiotic therapy is appropriate for travelers with severe diarrhea characterized by fever and blood, pus, or mucus in the stool, or diarrhea of any severity that substantially interferes with the purpose of travel. (See <a href=\"#H1720002804\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who warrant empiric antibiotic therapy for travelers' diarrhea, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or a fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Azithromycin is preferred for children, pregnant women, and travelers to Asia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifaximin</a> is an alternative agent, but should be avoided in patients with features of invasive diarrhea (eg, bloody or mucoid stool) (See <a href=\"#H1720002875\" class=\"local\">'Selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-antibiotic symptomatic management (eg, bismuth or antimotility agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> or diphenoxylate) can be used for mild or moderate diarrhea. For travelers with severe diarrhea, we suggest that antimotility agents only be taken in conjunction with antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Because they address the symptoms but not the cause, antimotility agents can mask the amount of fluid lost into the intestine. Additionally, there is concern that they can prolong or exacerbate dysentery. These agents should be discontinued promptly if abdominal pain develops, other symptoms worsen, or diarrhea persists.
