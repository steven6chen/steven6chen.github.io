Although some have defined cardiomyopathy to include myocardial disease caused by known cardiovascular causes (such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or valvular disease), current major society definitions of cardiomyopathy exclude heart disease secondary to such cardiovascular disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prognosis in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy is variable and dependent on the cause; importantly, there are some etiologies that may improve or resolve following treatment. One such cause is an arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (also known as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, and tachymyopathy), a relatively rare though well-recognized entity caused by long-standing tachycardia, which in most instances is readily treatable with a good prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy has been reported with nearly all types of tachyarrhythmias and frequent ectopy, both supraventricular and ventricular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>A common clinical problem is determining whether the tachycardia is the primary cause of the patient's cardiomyopathy, or if the tachycardia is secondary to a cardiomyopathy of different etiology. This topic will discuss arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy as a primary cause of cardiomyopathy. Arrhythmias occurring in the setting of a specific cardiomyopathy are discussed separately.

Virtually every form of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, including ectopic atrial tachycardia, nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation (AF), has been associated with reversible left ventricular dysfunction or &quot;cardiomyopathy.&quot; The development of a cardiomyopathy has also been documented with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and frequent ectopic beats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

Patients with an arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy were younger (mean age 39 versus 51 years), more frequently male (60 versus 38 percent), and had incessant or very frequent paroxysmal tachycardia (100 versus 20 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among a cohort of 625 patients undergoing catheter ablation for a variety of tachyarrhythmias, a tachycardia&ndash;induced cardiomyopathy was present in 2.7 percent (17 of 625 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic tachycardia ultimately produces significant cardiac structural changes, including left ventricular dilatation and cellular morphologic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. However, the exact mechanism by which tachycardia produces these changes is not well defined. </p><p>Animal models, initially developed in the general investigation of heart failure, have been studied extensively in the evaluation of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy. Rapid pacing produces changes in animals that are similar to those observed in humans, including a marked depression of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), elevated filling pressures, depressed cardiac output, and increased systemic vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/15-17,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17,19-23</a>]. These changes are generally reversible with cessation of the tachycardia, although in some cases LVEF may not return to baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Similar findings have been reported in an animal model following the delivery of ventricular premature beats in a bigeminal pattern for 12 weeks, which resulted in left ventricular dilatation and reduction in LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].<br/><br/>The morphologic and biochemical changes that result from an arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy also may produce electrophysiologic abnormalities. In a canine model, chronic tachycardia was associated with ventricular arrhythmias (including polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and sudden death) that result from a prolongation in repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Many alterations in neurohumoral and cellular activation have been described, and several factors probably contribute to the development of rate-related myocardial dysfunction. Although data supporting certain potential mechanisms are compelling, it remains unclear whether they play an etiologic role or if they arise as a consequence of tachycardia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depletion of myocardial energy stores and myocardial ischemia</strong> &ndash; Studies in animal models have shown that persistent tachycardia depletes high-energy stores as evidenced by reduced myocardial levels of creatine, phosphocreatine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> triphosphate (ATP), and diminished activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. These changes are probably due to alterations in cellular metabolism with mitochondrial injury and increased activity of Krebs cycle oxidative enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>].<br/><br/>Myocardial ischemia may play a role in the development of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy. Similar depletions in high-energy stores are seen in ischemic models following vessel occlusion, situations where high-energy stores are rapidly depleted and left ventricular dysfunction occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. High-energy stores return to normal within days after the ischemic insults. Tachycardia-induced depletion of high-energy stores, which may be mediated in part by ischemia, is reversible and may explain the reversibility of this cardiomyopathy.<br/><br/>Abnormalities in subendocardial to subepicardial flow ratios and impaired coronary flow have been found in arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. The impaired coronary blood flow occurs in association with elevation in cardiac filling pressures and impaired left ventricular diastolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/24,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,36,37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal calcium handling and beta adrenergic</strong> <strong>responsiveness</strong> &ndash; Abnormalities in both calcium channel activity and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport may contribute to the myocardial dysfunction in arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/19,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,34</a>]. Diminished beta-adrenergic responsiveness has also been described and may be due to reduced myocyte beta-1 receptor density (downregulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/36,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38,39</a>]. The reduction in beta receptor density and responsiveness is independent of hemodynamic and neurohumoral factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oxidative stress and injury</strong> &ndash; In patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial dysfunction, there is histologic evidence of oxidative stress and injury in the atrial myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This results in peroxynitrite formation, which modifies myofibrillar proteins, contributes to loss of fibrillar protein function, and alters myofibrillar energetics.<br/><br/>Support for the role of oxidative stress comes from one animal study which found that the administration of the antioxidant vitamins E, C, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> attenuated the cardiac dysfunction and prevented beta receptor downregulation produced by rapid cardiac pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are associated with a 287 base pair insertion <span class=\"nowrap\">(I)/deletion</span> (D) polymorphism in intron 16 of the ACE gene. The DD genotype is associated with increased serum ACE levels and a higher incidence of both ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In a study comparing 20 patients with arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, 20 controls with persistent tachycardia but normal LV function, and 24 normal volunteers, the DD genotype was significantly more common in the patients with arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ARRHYTHMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH ARRHYTHMIA-INDUCED CARDIOMYOPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of tachyarrhythmias have been associated with arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, reentrant supraventricular tachycardias, and ventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/11,44-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,44-58</a>]. In addition, very frequent ectopic beats, both atrial and ventricular, have been associated with arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy. Regardless of the arrhythmia, therapy to restore normal sinus rhythm or to slow the ventricular rate (or eliminate ectopy) appears to result in an improvement in left ventricular function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59233 \">table 1</a>).

In some patients, restoration of sinus rhythm or control of the rapid ventricular rate markedly improves or even normalizes the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), indicating that the left ventricular dysfunction was primarily due to the rapid AF rather than another etiology. Improvement in left ventricular function is seen with both rhythm and rate control, although it may be more likely with rhythm control.

Children are more likely than adults to present with arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy due to incessant AT. When AT is seen in adults, it is more commonly associated with another cardiac problem, and distinguishing the effect of tachycardia from that of the underlying cardiac disease may be difficult.

However, by definition, all patients with an arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should have a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5490489\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy is defined by the presence of a sustained tachycardia (or frequent episodes of tachycardia or very frequent ectopy) which results in left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Determining which of the pathologies (the arrhythmia or the cardiomyopathy) is the primary pathologic process is key to establishing the diagnosis. Usually the diagnosis of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy can only be made following a successful trial of therapy to slow the ventricular rate or to restore sinus rhythm along with the exclusion of other potential causes of cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Patients in whom arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy is suspected should undergo continuous cardiac monitoring for 24 to 48 hours and have non-invasive imaging to assess cardiac structure and function. For most patients, a transthoracic echocardiogram is the preferred test for assessing cardiac structure and function due to its widespread availability and ease of performance; however, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a reasonable alternative approach in centers with expertise in this modality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2430238\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy is suspected, appropriately selected tests can help to establish the diagnosis.

A sustained heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, and particularly greater than 120 beats per minutes, is consistent with arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy. Because of the potential reversible nature of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, if uncertainty persists regarding the cardiac rhythm, full invasive electrophysiologic studies may be necessary to establish the underlying cardiac rhythm and guide the optimal therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5490376\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cardiac electrophysiology studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5490755\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of cardiac structure and function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should undergo an assessment of cardiac structure and function to document left ventricular size and function, in particular left ventricular ejection fraction. Transthoracic echocardiography is the most common and widespread test for documenting cardiac structure and function, but cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an alternative approach. While there are no absolute echocardiographic parameters that can distinguish arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy from other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, in general, the LV end-diastolic dimension tends to be smaller in patients with arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,84</a>]. </p><p>CMR may be useful in following patients who have experienced improved ejection fraction (EF) after treatment of the arrhythmia.

Alternatively, in assessing the underlying cause of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, patients in one study with frequent VPBs who failed to improve EF after treatment were found to have late gadolinium enhancement on CMR, and likely the cause of the cardiomyopathy was not purely tachycardia mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5490763\"><span class=\"h2\">Excluding other causes of cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with newly diagnosed heart failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiomyopathy require an assessment for genetic and other causes of left ventricular dysfunction and exclusion of significant underlying coronary heart disease (CHD). Decisions on the initial use of stress testing or coronary angiography should be made based on the presence or absence of symptoms suggestive of CHD and the individual patient's likelihood of CHD. The differential diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, and the approach to excluding CHD, are discussed in greater detail separately. While patients with heart failure and cardiomyopathies of other etiologies may exhibit rapid heart rates (eg, persistent sinus tachycardia), this can usually be distinguished from an arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy by comparison of ECG findings over time (eg, sinus P wave morphology) and response to treatment.

Control of heart rate can be met through either a rate control strategy with atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agents (or ablation and pacer implant in cases of multiple drug failures) or through maintenance of sinus rhythm (rhythm control strategy). In patients with AF or atrial flutter resulting in cardiomyopathy that is suspected to be arrhythmia-induced, heart rate control through either means (rate control or rhythm control) can be very effective at improving cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>].

Options for the restoration of sinus rhythm include electrical cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drugs, and catheter ablation of the arrhythmia. The initial choice of modality will vary depending upon the underlying SVT as well as the local expertise and availability of options (ie, some centers do not perform catheter ablation) but should be made in conjunction with an electrophysiologist experienced in the treatment of sustained tachyarrhythmias.</p><p>Certain SVTs are more amenable to electrical cardioversion (eg, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia), while others are often refractory or recurrent following cardioversion (eg, atrial tachycardia). Often, atrial arrhythmias can be refractory to antiarrhythmics, and AV nodal blocking agents may be required in high dosages to achieve appropriate heart rates. In patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), it is important to avoid agents that have a higher likelihood of proarrhythmia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>) or that could further depress LVEF (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a>).
