Normally, the kidneys filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). When people have kidney failure, also called &quot;end-stage renal disease,&quot; their kidneys stop working.</p><p>During a kidney transplant, a doctor puts a healthy kidney in a person's body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59957\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59957 \">figure 2</a>). Then the new kidney can do the job of the diseased kidneys. (People need only 1 kidney to live.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16551986\"><span class=\"h1\">Where can a new kidney come from?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A new kidney can come from a:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living donor &ndash; A living donor is usually a family member or friend. He or she can be related to you, but doesn't need to be. A living donor can also be someone you don't know, but this is not as common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dead donor</p><p/><p>Getting a new kidney from a living donor is almost always better than getting a kidney from a dead donor. That's because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A kidney from a living donor is usually healthier and lasts longer.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You don't have to wait as long for a new kidney. You can get a new kidney before your kidneys stop working completely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your body is more likely to react better to a kidney from a living donor.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16552001\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I plan for a kidney transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should start planning while your kidneys still work and before your kidney disease gets severe. You will need time to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Find a living donor (if you want a living donor)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meet with doctors and have the exams and tests you need before surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get information and make plans &ndash; You should find out if your health insurance will pay for the transplant. You might need to make plans for when you are in the hospital and away from your job or family.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16552016\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I plan for a kidney transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, your doctor will send you to a transplant center. At the transplant center, you will meet with different doctors and have exams and tests.</p><p>Not everyone who wants a kidney transplant can get one. People usually can't have a kidney transplant if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe heart disease or another serious long-term illnesses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have cancer or recently had cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are too overweight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can't or won't take medicines every day after surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink too much alcohol or use drugs</p><p/><p>The person who wants to donate a kidney also needs to go to a transplant center. He or she needs to meet with doctors and have exams and tests. To donate a kidney, a person needs to be healthy and meet certain conditions. The person getting the kidney is called the &quot;recipient.&quot;</p><p>It's important to know that the results of the donor's exams and tests are kept secret. Plus, he or she can change his or her mind about donating at any time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16552031\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I don't have a living donor or my living donor isn't a good match?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you don't have a living donor or your donor isn't a good match, you have a few options.</p><p>You can be put on a list to get a kidney from a dead donor. An organization called &quot;UNOS&quot; keeps track of this list. When a new kidney is available, UNOS decides who is next on the list to get it.</p><p>One downside to being on this list is that you need to have very severe kidney disease to get to the top of the list. While you are waiting for your kidney transplant, you will probably need a treatment called &quot;dialysis.&quot; People who need to have dialysis before a kidney transplant usually don't live as long as people who don't need to have dialysis before a transplant.</p><p>If you have a living donor, but he or she isn't a good match for you, you can look for an &quot;exchange program.&quot; One type of exchange program is called a &quot;paired exchange.&quot; In a paired exchange, you and your donor find another donor and recipient who don't match each other, but do match with you. Then your donor can give a kidney to the other recipient, and the other donor can give a kidney to you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16552046\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycystic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Polycystic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-between-dialysis-and-kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing between dialysis and kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-for-hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preparing for hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peritoneal dialysis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me?
