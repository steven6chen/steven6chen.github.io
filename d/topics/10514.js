In the majority of cases, metastatic cervical cancer is not curable. However, for some patients who present with recurrent disease in the pelvis (locoregional recurrence) or with limited distant metastatic disease, surgical treatment is potentially curative. </p><p>Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinomas account for approximately 70, 25, and 3 to 5 percent of all cervical cancers, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65824 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

On pelvic exam, a mass or nodularity at the vaginal cuff, which may extend to the pelvic side wall, may be visualized or palpated. Disease within the vagina (or vaginal vault) can be tender to palpation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prone to bleeding easily. </p><p>By comparison, patients with metastatic cervical cancer usually present with either no symptoms or nonspecific complaints (ie, fatigue, nausea, or weight loss); however, they may have symptoms related to the site of metastases. As an example, patients with bone metastases present with chronic pain, not alleviated with rest. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172229098\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with findings suspicious for recurrence on pelvic exam should undergo a biopsy. </p><p>Women who present with signs (ie, weight loss, palpable abdominal lesions) or symptoms (ie, pain, nausea, or weight loss) should undergo radiologic imaging to evaluate for metastatic disease. In addition, imaging is essential for women who present with a mass on pelvic exam because the extent of disease will influence the treatment plan. </p><p>Metastatic cervical cancer may present as nodal disease involving the pelvic, para-aortic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supraclavicular nodes; limited disease involving one organ site; or widely metastatic disease. In one study of over 200 patients, distant metastases, disease limited to the para-aortic nodes, and disease in the supraclavicular nodes (with or without para-aortic node involvement) was found in 65, 22, and 14 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In another review of the literature, the estimated prevalence of organ site involvement by metastatic cervical cancer was [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic or para-aortic nodes (75 and 62 percent, respectively)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung (33 to 38 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver (33 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneum (5 to 27 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenal gland (14 to 16 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestines (12 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin (10 percent)</p><p/><p>The most commonly used imaging modalities to evaluate recurrent cervical cancer include computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) with or without CT. Of these, we suggest <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> for evaluation of local and distant disease. It has a sensitivity of 93 to 96 percent and specificity of 93 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, the results from a <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan often lead to changes to the therapeutic plan for women with recurrent disease by sparing women from an extensive surgical approach in the setting of widely metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. </p><p>Patients presenting with isolated metastatic findings on imaging should undergo a biopsy to prove metastatic disease, as there is a risk that these findings may represent a second primary malignancy or a benign process. As an example, in one series of 23 women with cervical cancer who presented with pulmonary lesions and underwent resection, seven (29 percent) were diagnosed with primary lung cancer at final pathologic analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

However, surgical complications are more common in this setting. In one study, 15 of 34 patients who underwent surgery for persistent or recurrent disease following RT experienced major postoperative complications, including fistula formation (in five women).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343518606\"><span class=\"h4\">Following hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who have undergone hysterectomy (with or without adjuvant RT or chemoradiation), pelvic exenteration represents the only potentially curative option for local recurrence or persistent disease. Careful patient selection is required given the perioperative and postoperative morbidity associated with this extensive surgical approach.

The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 43 and 33 percent, respectively, and pelvic control rates were 69 and 62 percent, respectively. The use of brachytherapy and a long treatment-free interval between primary surgery and diagnosis of recurrence were positive predictors of a good outcome. </p><p>Given the superiority of concomitant chemotherapy with RT (chemoradiation) over RT alone as primary treatment, most experts prefer chemoradiation for these patients.

Chemotherapy has activity for the treatment of cervical cancer, although treatment is less successful if the recurrence is in an area that was previously irradiated.

For patients with limited metastatic disease (ie, disease in the para-aortic nodes or solitary lung metastasis), treatment can be directed towards the area of recurrence using radiation therapy (RT) or, in selected cases, a surgical approach. However, for women with more extensive disease, chemotherapy is the only treatment option. </p><p>The treatment approach to women with metastatic disease is discussed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104509153\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease isolated to the lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women presenting with disease limited to the nodes (para-aortic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supraclavicular nodes), the prognosis is poor. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 375 patients with recurrent cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The rate of overall survival at five years was 27 and 0 percent for women with limited metastatic disease involving the para-aortic nodes (n = 60) or the supraclavicular nodes (n = 26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>There are limited data to help guide treatment of women with metastatic disease limited to the lymph nodes. Some experts prefer systemic chemotherapy, while others prefer RT (with or without chemotherapy). The choice between treatments depends on institutional practice and patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H2177909474\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104508737\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In selected patients who present with limited metastatic disease, resection may be feasible. As an example, in one series of 15 women who underwent resection of pulmonary metastases for cervical cancer, 13 were alive with a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 4 to 68 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The short interval of follow-up and lack of historical controls (that received chemotherapy, for example) limits interpretation of this approach. Given the potential morbidity associated with resection, careful selection of patients is required.
