Unlike computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the technique is portable, quick, and can be used to efficiently guide interventional procedures. Ultrasound uses no ionizing radiation to create the image and is therefore the initial technique of choice in pregnant women, in patients with contrast allergies, or in those in whom MRI is contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the role of ultrasound in the evaluation of the liver and the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound and the use of ultrasound for the evaluation of the gallbladder are discussed briefly here and in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Ultrasonography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Transabdominal ultrasound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-polyps-and-cholesterolosis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder polyps and cholesterolosis&quot;, section on 'Ultrasonography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-enhanced-ultrasound-for-the-evaluation-of-liver-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation of liver lesions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H996453276\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound relies upon the transmission of targeted sound waves of varying selected frequencies through tissues, with subsequent computerized conversion of the signals from the reflected waves into anatomical images on a screen. The degree of reflection of sound waves depends upon the interface between tissues with different acoustic properties. The degree of echogenicity depends upon the ability of the tissue being evaluated to reflect or absorb the ultrasound waves. Thus, a fatty liver will attenuate the ultrasound beam somewhat, limiting full evaluation of the liver parenchyma. Similarly, waves are not transmitted through air; liver lying below interposed loops of bowel will therefore be poorly visualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal measurements on ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurements of components of the hepatobiliary tree depend upon the skill of the ultrasonographer obtaining the measurements, and there is variability in terms of what is considered &quot;normal.&quot; However, some general estimates are available regarding the expected sizes of structures in the hepatobiliary tree: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallbladder: The gallbladder wall should be less than or equal to 2 mm (in a distended or fasting gallbladder). Collapsed gallbladders, seen when the subject has eaten, typically appear slightly more thickened. Typically, the maximum &quot;normal&quot; dimension of the gallbladder is 5 X 10 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common hepatic duct: The common hepatic duct (inner wall to inner wall) is usually measured at the level of the hepatic artery. In the normal fasting state, it should be &lt;7 mm in patients &lt;60 years, and &lt;10 mm in patients older than 60.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common bile duct (CBD): The normal CBD diameter increases with age and in patients who have had a cholecystectomy. In patients in their 40s, the normal mean diameter is 4 mm. The normal mean diameter then increases by 1 mm every decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>], and authors have proposed that in older patients the normal upper limit of normal be set at 8.5 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The CBD is commonly up to 10 mm in patients who have undergone a cholecystectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver: The span of the liver in the right midclavicular line should be less than 16 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Color flow Doppler ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vessel patency and flow direction can be determined by assigning color flow properties to the ultrasound image. The transducer detects moving blood and is arbitrarily assigned a red or blue color depending upon whether flow is toward or away from the transducer, respectively. Much variation exists in flow velocities, which are further influenced by fasting or eating. The range of normal velocities in the hepatic artery and portal veins is 30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/second</span> and 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/second,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Color flow is an important tool in evaluating the vascular supply of hepatic masses, although no sensitive or specific flow features have been described that allow the lesions to be differentiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Most hepatocellular carcinomas have internal vascularity that can be detected by color flow Doppler, although a number of metastatic lesions also have internal vascularity, limiting the usefulness of this technique for distinguishing between these two entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Color flow Doppler imaging primarily is used in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is very accurate when evaluating tumor-induced occlusion of major hepatic vessels, and is quite sensitive for documenting the direction of flow within the vessel being interrogated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. This is particularly useful in planning surgery for patients with cirrhosis in whom flow direction may be reversed in the main portal vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is routinely used to evaluate patients prior to liver transplantation since portal vein patency is an important technical issue for the transplant surgeon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color flow is used to document the flow direction and patency of surgically created portosystemic shunts and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color flow is frequently used to demonstrate lack of flow in dilated intrahepatic ducts, thereby distinguishing dilated ducts from adjacent intrahepatic vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Duplex Doppler ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duplex Doppler ultrasound converts an audible signal reflected from a selected region of interest on the ultrasound image into a continuous waveform that includes data concerning frequency, amplitude, and flow direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Thus, flow rate can be accurately measured, the characteristics of flow demonstrated, and flow direction determined. These features may be important in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow rate is particularly important in the follow-up of patients following a TIPS insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up of TIPS'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow characteristics, such as increased resistance to flow in rejecting livers (with peaking of the systolic wave and lack of antegrade diastolic flow), or characteristic waveforms associated with hepatic artery stenosis (the Tardus-Parvus pattern) are used to evaluate the newly transplanted liver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duplex to-and-fro waveform has a characteristic diagnostic pattern in suspected arteriovenous fistulae following liver biopsies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular indices and ratios</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempts have been made to document different vascular indices and ratios for differentiating various hepatic lesions, including hepatic metastases, hemangiomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. These flow indices are not widely available at present and are currently used in experimental settings only.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Doppler perfusion index (DPI) is the ratio of hepatic arterial to total liver blood flow. DPI is elevated in the presence of intrahepatic tumors and may therefore be useful in screening patients with suspected metastases. DPI is also increased in patients with cirrhosis, probably due to elevation of portal pressure and augmented hepatic arterial flow; this limits its diagnostic potential in evaluating mass lesions in patients with cirrhosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The portal vein congestive index (PVCI) is the ratio of cross-sectional area of the portal vein to the time averaged velocity of blood flow in the portal vein. The PVCI is higher in cirrhotic livers when compared with livers containing metastases. These findings have been explained by data from animal studies in which there have been an increased hepatic artery flow and decreased portal vein flow in the presence of liver metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor peak systolic velocity (TPSV) is another criterion used to characterize hepatic lesions. For lesions larger than 2 cm, a TPSV of &gt;0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> has a moderate sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing malignant tumors from hemangiomas. However, the TPSV is not helpful in distinguishing hepatocellular carcinoma from metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hepatic tumor index (HTI) is the ratio of TPSV to peak systolic velocity in the right or left hepatic artery. The HTI has potential use in determining the nature of a liver mass. The HTI of masses &gt;1 cm has a moderate sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing hepatocellular carcinoma from metastatic lesions and hemangiomas. When both TPSV and HTI are used in combination (TPSV &gt;0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> and HTI &gt;1.0), there is a high sensitivity (91 percent) and specificity (83 percent) for distinguishing hepatocellular carcinomas from metastatic lesions and hemangiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound is very sensitive for differentiating cystic from solid lesions, and for delineating septations within cystic lesions such as biliary cystadenomas. Ultrasound will identify solid lesions, but the imaging characteristics are usually nonspecific, requiring careful clinical or biochemical correlation, additional imaging studies, or biopsy. Certain lesions, such as hemangiomas, have a characteristic sonographic appearance, and in some cases, require no additional imaging when identified. Similarly, focal fatty infiltration or sparing is easily identified on ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20554370\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of pneumobilia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumobilia, or air within the hepatobiliary system, may also be detected on ultrasound.

Doppler ultrasound is a sensitive technique for distinguishing between tumor-induced thrombus occluding a portal or hepatic vein and tumor thrombus invading a vein. The neovascularity of tumor thrombus is detectable as an arterial signal within the thrombus; ultrasound can also be used to guide biopsy of these thrombi, if indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound is used to identify and localize tumors to specific liver segments, facilitating surgical planning if resection is being considered.

Ultrasound also provides useful additional information concerning the nature of the fluid, such as the presence of septations, loculations, hematoma, and peristalsing loops of bowel. Bedside guidance for paracentesis can be provided for the sick patient unable to travel to the radiology department, since ultrasound is mobile. Currently, no imaging technology can differentiate between a transudate and an exudate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascites in adults with cirrhosis: Initial therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Doppler flow patterns in the portal vein may help determine the cause of the ascites. Normally, flow in the portal vein is continuous in a hepatopetal direction, with slight undulations due to respiration and cardiac activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In patients with portal hypertension, portal venous flow may show mild to severe deviations from normal. With increasing portal pressures, flow within the portal vein slows and progressively becomes more hepatofugal. In patients with portal hypertension due to right-sided heart failure with tricuspid regurgitation, flow within the portal vein may appear pulsatile. In addition, the hepatic veins become enlarged and are easily visible in the presence of right heart failure, a finding that would not be expected in the presence of primary hepatic disease.</p><p>However, the portal waveform cannot be used to definitively diagnose cardiac ascites. For example, the portal waveform may become flattened in the cirrhotic liver, a finding that may also be seen in chronically congested livers due to right heart failure. Clinical signs of heart failure or chronic liver disease should be sought. In addition, there should be additional features of liver decompensation when hepatic ascites is present. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77046198\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of hepatic fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension by transient elastography is an exciting, newer application of ultrasound.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-enhanced-ultrasound-for-the-evaluation-of-liver-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation of liver lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative and laparoscopic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative ultrasound of the liver is a versatile adjunct to surgical inspection and palpation; it is being used with increased frequency to identify small (2 to 5 mm) metastases in patients undergoing segmental liver resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Specially developed ultrasound probes are used on standard diagnostic ultrasound machines. The technique is more sensitive than CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and regular ultrasound, routinely detecting unexpected tumors in approximately 5 percent of patients. In clinical series, the surgical procedure is modified in 51 percent of patients based upon intraoperative ultrasound findings alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic laparoscopic ultrasound has extended the role of standard staging laparoscopy by being able to detect small peritoneal and hepatic lesions easily missed by other staging methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is particularly well suited for imaging the biliary system. The technique is not widely performed; it requires separate insertion sites to evaluate the left and right lobes of the liver unless the falciform ligament is resected. A complete scan of the liver is performed to exclude small lesions using small (&lt;1 cm) flexible transducers incorporated into the tip of a fiberoptic endoscope; biopsy guidance can also be provided if necessary. The porta hepatis is easily imaged to identify enlarged nodes for staging purposes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Contrast agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound contrast agents modify the basic physical interactions between ultrasound waves and body tissues and amplify the signal produced by flowing blood. These agents may be useful for detecting subtle flow abnormalities and for distinguishing areas of abnormal flow relative to normal background parenchymal perfusion. As a result, they may improve the detection of neoplasms, tumor vascularity, vascular stenosis and focal liver lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. However, the procedure can be time-consuming and requires the availability of experienced operators. In addition, the contrast agents used for contrast-enhanced ultrasound are not currently available in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-enhanced-ultrasound-for-the-evaluation-of-liver-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation of liver lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Three contrast phases can be differentiated due to the specific blood supply of the liver:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arterial phase (hepatic artery) starts 10 to 20 seconds after intravenous injection and lasts for 10 to 15 seconds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The venous phase (portal vein) extends from 30 to 35 seconds after intravenous injection and lasts up to 120 seconds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The late phase starts at 120 seconds and lasts up to five minutes post-injection with the disappearance of bubbles</p><p/><p>Several agents have been developed to enhance sonographic differences between tissues and to improve the characterization of vascular flow of liver lesions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbon dioxide microbubbles injected into the hepatic artery of patients with small (&lt;3 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas enhance most tumors, with a greater sensitivity for hypervascular lesions than conventional ultrasonography, angiography, or CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. One commercially available contrast agent (Levovist) consists of microbubbles adsorbed onto galactose particles and palmitic acid. Delayed post-vascular scanning with Levovist has shown promise in detecting liver lesions (especially malignancy); however, Levovist is no longer being produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perfluorochemicals are promising compounds with a high sonographic density and compressibility, which allows them to act as highly reflective ultrasound contrast agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. They are normally phagocytosed by the reticuloendothelial system and remain in the spleen and liver for at least two days, resulting in a rim-like region of increased echogenicity around tumors. A preliminary clinical trial demonstrated that a large quantity of these compounds was needed to produce adequate tumor enhancement, and that they may cause allergic reactions and transient elevation of liver enzymes, thus presenting a potential problem for their future clinical use.</p><p/><p>Additional agents now in clinical trials rely upon the targeted sound wave to disrupt small contrast-containing vesicles, thereby enhancing the signal produced by flowing blood. Additional imaging techniques that are contrast-specific (eg, harmonic and pulse-inversion imaging) are also in development.</p><p>Patterns seen with common hepatic lesions include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemangiomas have peripheral globular contrast pooling in the early phase (a cotton wool appearance), with the globules becoming larger and more numerous (centripetal fill-in).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal nodular hyperplasia has centrifugal stellate branching in the early arterial phase followed by an intense homogenous uptake (spoke wheel pattern). Rapid washout occurs thereafter and an iso- or hyperechoic lesion is seen in the portal venous phase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatocellular carcinoma shows strong enhancement during the arterial phase and one or more feeding arteries can be seen entering the lesions' periphery. Intense global pooling in the late arterial phase is followed by a rapid washout in the portal venous phase.</p><p/><p>The accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography appears to be similar to other contrast-enhanced imaging modalities. It appears to improve sensitivity and specificity compared with standard ultrasonography in patients with a variety of liver lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>], and certain sonographic characteristics appear to correlate well with specific tumor types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>In a meta-analysis that included 18 studies, contrast-enhanced ultrasound performed similarly to contrast-enhanced CT and contrast-enhanced MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In patients with incidental focal liver lesions, contrast-enhanced ultrasound had a sensitivity of 95 percent and a specificity of 94 percent for the diagnosis of malignant lesions.</p><p>The utility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound is markedly reduced in patients with severe steatosis or deep-seated lesions. In those with multiple liver lesions, arterial and early portal phases cannot be investigated simultaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H142044133\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound is the least invasive radiologic modality for imaging the liver and biliary tract.
