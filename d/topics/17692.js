Based upon clinical trial data from Europe, the main indication for dexamethasone therapy in adults is known or suspected pneumococcal meningitis.

Among adults with bacterial meningitis in the United States, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and <em>Neisseria meningitidis </em>are the most common infecting organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>].

Since there are limited randomized trials regarding the therapy of specific causes of bacterial meningitis, treatment recommendations are based upon in vitro susceptibility and pharmacodynamic data as well as accumulated clinical experience.</p><p>Directed therapy against a specific organism is recommended when the clinical presentation and results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stain are unequivocal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75922 \">table 1C</a>) or the cultures are already positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81209\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81209 \">table 1D</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>]. If, on the other hand, empiric therapy is begun, the regimen should be adjusted, if necessary, once the culture results are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81209\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81209 \">table 1D</a>). For the targeted regimen, agents should have good CNS penetration and the patient's isolate should demonstrate in vitro susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Recommended dosages for use in patients with normal renal and hepatic function are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60707 \">table 1B</a>).</p><p>The duration of therapy for meningitis in adults has not been subjected to rigorous trials in the United States or other developed countries. The recommendations in the following sections reflect general consensus and are fairly conservative. However, a longer course may be warranted when complicating features are present or the clinical response is unusually slow. On the other hand, shorter courses (eg, single doses of depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> or conventional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>) have been successful in the management of epidemic meningococcal meningitis in developing countries.

In a review of 248 patients with bacterial meningitis seen in 1995 in acute care hospitals in 22 counties in 4 states in the United States, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> accounted for 60 percent of cases in adults up to age 60 and almost 70 percent in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a more recent United States surveillance study between 2003 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], 1083 cases of bacterial meningitis were reported in adults, with <em>S. pneumoniae</em> responsible for 71 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Community-acquired meningitis'</a>.)</p><p>Although rates of pneumococcal meningitis have been reported to have decreased among both children and adults since the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in children, there has also been a concerning increase in meningitis caused by pneumococcal serotypes not in the vaccine (specifically serotypes 19A, 22F, and 35B). Thus, there is a need for continued monitoring of the serotypes causing invasive infection. With the licensure of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-conjugate-vaccine-13-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</a> (PCV13) in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], further declines in the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis may be seen. However, in one study that examined the impact of PCV13 on the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis in children, the number of cases in 2009 compared with 2007 was unchanged, although the proportion of cases caused by serotypes in the vaccine decreased significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Good results were also obtained with a third-generation cephalosporin, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>However, the widespread emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococcus has made penicillin an inappropriate empiric therapy without proof of in vitro susceptibility. Although many third-generation cephalosporins have good in vitro activity against strains of pneumococcus that have intermediate susceptibility to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 0.12 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> according to the cutoffs used prior to 2008, reports have raised the possibility of clinical failure when cephalosporin resistance coexists with penicillin resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63881\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63881 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In 2008, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute removed the &quot;intermediate&quot; susceptibility category (MIC 0.12 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> for the penicillin breakpoints of meningeal isolates of <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, such that all meningeal isolates with an MIC &ge;0.12 are considered resistant.
