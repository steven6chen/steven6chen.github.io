New information has led to increased understanding of genetic defects related to diabetes. Monogenic causes of type 2 diabetes (eg, those causing maturity onset diabetes of the young) represent only a small fraction of cases, and commonly inherited polymorphisms individually contribute only small degrees of risk for, or protection from, diabetes. Most of the genetic risk for type 2 diabetes results from complex polygenic risk factors.</p><p>The etiologic classification of diabetes mellitus will be reviewed here. The definition and diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE 1 DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 1 diabetes is characterized by destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. This is usually due to autoimmune destruction of the beta cells (type 1A). Testing for islet cell antibodies (ICA) or other islet autoantibodies (antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD] 65; insulin; the tyrosine phosphatases, insulinoma-associated protein 2 [IA-2] and IA-2 beta; and zinc transporter ZnT8) in serum may be helpful if establishing the diagnosis is important; a positive result is indicative of immune-mediated or type 1A diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the absence of pancreatic autoantibodies does not rule out the possibility of type 1 diabetes. Some patients with absolute insulin deficiency have no evidence of autoimmunity and have no other known cause for beta cell destruction. They are said to have idiopathic or type 1B diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification of diabetes mellitus does not reflect the clinical heterogeneity of patients with diabetes and the emergence of the concept that early beta cell dysfunction is likely to be a primary defect in the pathophysiology of diabetes, regardless of &quot;type.&quot; Other classification schemes have been proposed, accounting for beta cell autoimmunity, beta cell function, clinical features, and body weight. The high prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obesity</span> in the population has further complicated classification systems with an added element of insulin resistance even in type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes of ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>It is anticipated that other subtypes of type 1 (and type 2 diabetes) will become more clearly defined in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H247196672\"><span class=\"h2\">Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older studies in predominantly Scandinavian populations have suggested that as many as 7.5 to 10 percent of adults in populations with a high prevalence of type 1 diabetes and with apparent type 2 diabetes may have circulating autoantibodies directed against pancreatic beta cell antigens (ICA or GAD65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The prevalence of LADA is almost certainly lower in the more diverse United States population. These adults do not require insulin at diagnosis but progress to insulin dependence after several months to years. This entity is sometimes referred to as &quot;latent autoimmune diabetes in adults&quot; (LADA) and may account for a very small fraction of all cases of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>In genotyping analyses, LADA shares genetic features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. As an example, in one analysis, patients with LADA shared an increased frequency of risk for an <em>HLA-DQB1</em> genotype with patients with type 1 diabetes and for a variant in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (<em>TCF7L2</em>) gene with patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The variant in <em>TCF7L2</em> has been shown to increase the risk for type 2 diabetes in several populations, and the effect size was similar for LADA and type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, LADA appears to be on the spectrum of insulin deficiency between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Autoimmunity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Genetic susceptibility'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with LADA are a heterogeneous group of patients with variable titers of antibodies, body mass index (BMI), and frequency of progression to insulin dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with high compared with low titers of GAD65 antibodies usually have a lower BMI, less endogenous insulin secretion (as measured by stimulated serum C-peptide concentrations), and progress more quickly to insulin dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Thus, the presence and titers of anti-GAD antibodies (or ICA) can help to identify patients thought to have type 2 diabetes, who are likely to respond poorly to oral hypoglycemic drug therapy, require insulin, and to be at increased risk for developing ketoacidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/4,5,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,11-13</a>]. Studies are underway to determine whether early treatment with insulin or use of immunomodulator therapy can prevent disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing type 1 from type 2 diabetes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE 2 DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 2 diabetes is by far the most common type of diabetes in adults and is characterized by hyperglycemia and variable degrees of insulin deficiency and resistance. It is a common disorder whose prevalence rises markedly with increasing degrees of obesity. Insulin resistance and insulin deficiency can arise through genetic or environmental influences, making it difficult to determine the exact cause in an individual patient. In addition, hyperglycemia itself can impair pancreatic beta cell function and exacerbate insulin resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H270106199\"><span class=\"h2\">DKA in type 2 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with type 2 diabetes typically present with hyperglycemia, although ketoacidosis can occur. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in type 2 diabetes occurs by several mechanisms, similar to those in type 1 diabetes. The stress of infection or other illness causes increased secretion of counterregulatory hormones and further increases insulin resistance. The already impaired insulin secretion is unable to respond to the increased demand, leading to hyperglycemia, which may further impair insulin secretion via glucose toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes of ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTINGUISHING TYPE 1 FROM TYPE 2 DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is occasionally difficult to distinguish between type 1 and atypical presentations of type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes have an absolute requirement for insulin therapy. However, many patients with type 2 diabetes lose beta cell function over time and require insulin for glucose control. Thus, need for insulin per se does not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. While it is known that diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can occur in the presence of complete insulin deficiency and it is not a typical feature of type 2 diabetes, some patients with type 2 diabetes develop DKA under certain circumstances (usually severe infection or other illness). Thus, ketoacidosis cannot be relied upon as an absolute indicator that the patient has type 1 diabetes or that long-term insulin therapy will be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes of ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, patients with type 1 diabetes may coincidentally have pathophysiologic elements of type 2 diabetes. In the past, poor metabolic control of type 1 diabetes prevented most of these patients from gaining weight. Intensive therapy now commonly used to manage type 1 diabetes has resulted in approximately 20 to 30 percent of type 1 diabetic patients becoming overweight or obese. Insulin resistance and other features of type 2 diabetes may be exhibited in overweight patients with type 1 diabetes, especially those who also have a family history of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The presence of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet cell, insulin, the tyrosine phosphatases (insulinoma-associated protein 2 [IA-2] and IA-2 beta), and zinc transporter (ZnT8) in patients with presumed type 2 diabetes can identify patients who may have type 1 diabetes (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [LADA]) and are more likely to require insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/4,5,12,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,12,13,15</a>]. Based upon a review of clinical features in 102 adult diabetic patients who did not initially require insulin but who were positive for anti-GAD antibodies, a screening tool was developed to identify adult patients with newly diagnosed diabetes who should be considered for antibody testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These features included: age of onset &lt;50 years, acute symptoms, body mass index (BMI) &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> and personal or family history of autoimmune disease. The presence of two or more criteria had a 90 percent sensitivity and 71 percent specificity for identifying patients positive for anti-GAD antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prediction of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Immunologic markers'</a>.)</p><p>We measure autoantibodies when the diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes is uncertain by clinical presentation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thin patient with poor response to initial therapy with sulfonylureas or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal or family history of autoimmune disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overweight or obese children or adolescents presenting with apparent type 2 diabetes, who actually may have an early presentation of type 1 diabetes</p><p/><p>Measuring more than one antibody will increase the likelihood of a positive value, but it is also more costly. Two (ie, islet cell and GAD65) or three (insulin, GAD65, and IA-2 or GAD65, IA-2, and ZnT8) antibodies can be measured. Insulin antibodies should not be measured if the patient has received insulin therapy for &ge;2 weeks, because this will generate insulin antibodies. If one or more of the antibodies is present, and especially if two or more are positive, the patient should be presumed to have type 1 diabetes and should be treated with insulin replacement therapy, as these patients respond poorly to diet and oral hypoglycemic drug therapy. In addition, during early stages in the development of type 1 diabetes, intensive insulin therapy prolongs beta cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Given the risk of ketoacidosis, insulin should also be started in any patient, regardless of whether they are thought to have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who is catabolic (weight loss or dehydration in the setting of hyperglycemia), or who has evidence of increased ketogenesis (ketonuria or acidosis).

Polymorphisms of multiple genes are reported to influence the risk of type 1A diabetes, including genes in both the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and elsewhere in the genome, but only human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have a large effect, followed by insulin gene polymorphisms, and PTPNN22. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Genetic susceptibility'</a>.)</p><p>Numerous common polymorphisms (approximately 50 to date) weakly contribute to the risk for or protection from type 2 diabetes. The genes encode proteins that cause alterations in several pathways leading to diabetes, including pancreatic development; insulin synthesis, processing, and secretion; amyloid deposition in beta cells; cellular insulin resistance; and impaired regulation of gluconeogenesis. Monogenic causes of type 2 diabetes represent only a small fraction of cases and commonly inherited polymorphisms individually contribute only small degrees of risk for, or protection from, diabetes. Most of the genetic risk for type 2 diabetes results from complex polygenic risk factors.

MODY is the most common form of monogenic diabetes, accounting for 2 to 5 percent of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The population prevalence of MODY in the United Kingdom is estimated to be 68 to 108 cases per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These patients are quite heterogeneous, and clinical characteristics may not be reliable in predicting the underlying pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Many patients are misclassified as having either type 1 or 2 diabetes.</p><p>Several different genetic abnormalities have been identified, each leading to a different type of disease. The subtypes of MODY are defined by specific descriptions of the known genetic defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83071\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83071 \">table 2</a>). The genes involved control pancreatic beta cell development, function, and regulation, and the mutations in these genes cause impaired glucose sensing and insulin secretion with minimal or no defect in insulin action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-alpha (<em>HNF1A</em>) and the glucokinase (<em>GCK</em>) gene are most commonly identified, occurring in 52 to 65 and 15 to 32 percent of MODY cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>]. Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor-4-alpha (<em>HNF4A</em>)<em> </em>account for approximately 10 percent of cases. Some members of a family have the genetic defect but do not develop diabetes; the reason for this is unclear. Other patients may have the classic MODY phenotype but do not have an identifiable mutation in any of the MODY genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4-alpha</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the <em>HNF4A</em> gene on chromosome 20 cause the condition formerly called MODY1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. <em>HNF4A</em> is expressed both in the liver and in pancreatic beta cells. One of its functions is to regulate positively the activity of <em>HNF1A</em>, the affected gene in the previously labeled MODY3 syndrome. The precise mechanism by which a defect in <em>HNF4A</em> causes hyperglycemia is not clear, but it has been associated with a reduced insulin secretory response to glucose, suggesting a primary genetic defect in insulin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The secretory defect is progressive, and patients typically present with hyperglycemia in adolescence or early childhood. Although the initial response to sulfonylureas is good, patients may require insulin as the secretory defect progresses. These patients are at risk for the microvascular and macrovascular complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Although <em>HNF4A</em> plays a central role in the hepatic synthesis of lipoprotein and coagulation proteins, these functions are largely maintained in <em>HNF4A</em> diabetes, suggesting that this disorder is primarily one of impaired pancreatic beta cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucokinase gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than a dozen mutations in the <em>GCK</em> gene on chromosome 7 have been described and were formerly called MODY2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Defects in the expression of <em>GCK</em>, which phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and probably acts as a glucose sensor, result in a higher threshold for glucose stimulated insulin secretion. On occasion, the expressed enzyme functions, but is unstable, again leading to an insulin secretory deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Patients with mutation in the <em>GCK</em> gene can often be controlled with diet alone.

Mutations of <em>HNF1A</em> can lead to abnormal insulin secretion; whether this or some other action is defective enough to cause diabetes mellitus is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Mutations also result in a low renal threshold for glucose. Thus, prior to onset of diabetes, mutation carriers have detectable glycosuria provoked by glucose loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Testing for glycosuria two hours after a glucose load could be used to screen children of mutation carriers and guide the need for further evaluation.</p><p>Patients with <em>HNF1A</em> diabetes have a similar clinical phenotype as patients with <em>HNF4A</em> diabetes.

As an example, patients with MODY due to <em>HNF1A</em> or <em>HNF4A</em> mutations are frequently misdiagnosed as having insulin requiring type 1 diabetes because they present at an early age and are not obese. However, many of these patients can be successfully managed with sulfonylureas monotherapy. In addition, distinguishing MODY from type 1 and type 2 diabetes allows earlier identification of at-risk family members.</p><p>We typically perform genetic testing for MODY when there is a high index of suspicion (familial diabetes with autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance [&gt;2 generations], onset &lt;25 years, nonobese, negative islet autoantibodies) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83072 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/21,24,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24,53</a>].</p><p>In all patients, therefore, it is important to obtain a detailed history of diabetes at diagnosis, including age, body mass index (BMI), and presenting symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. It is also important to ascertain insulin dependency and the presence or absence of family history of diabetes.</p><p>In a patient with presumed type 1 diabetes, measurement of serum autoantibodies (islet cell antibodies [ICA], glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD] 65, insulin, tyrosine phosphatases, insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2) and IA-2 beta) should be performed prior to consideration of genetic testing for MODY. The presence of autoantibodies makes MODY very unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>It is more difficult to differentiate between MODY and type 2 diabetes mellitus. For patients with presumed type 2 diabetes, the presence of a simple (non-multigenerational) family history does not discriminate between MODY and type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is not a feature of MODY. Thus, diabetes in the absence of obesity is suspicious for MODY, particularly in adolescents with presumed type 2 diabetes. However, the absence of obesity or surrogate markers of insulin resistance is, in general, a poor discriminator of MODY and type 2 diabetes in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes/abstract/21,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,54</a>].

This is usually due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Type 1 diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 diabetes is by far the most common type of diabetes and is characterized by variable degrees of insulin deficiency and resistance. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Type 2 diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is occasionally difficult to distinguish between type 1 and atypical presentations of type 2 diabetes. We measure two to three autoantibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD] 65, insulin, tyrosine phosphatases [insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2) and IA-2 beta], islet cell, or zinc transporter ZnT8) when the diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes is uncertain by clinical presentation (ie, thin patient with poor response to initial therapy with sulfonylureas or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, personal or family history of autoimmune disease). If one or more of the antibodies is present (and especially if two or more are positive), the patient should be presumed to have type 1 diabetes and should be treated with insulin replacement therapy, as these patients respond poorly to diet and oral hypoglycemic drug therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing type 1 from type 2 diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the human genome is further explored, it is likely that multiple genetic anomalies at different loci will be found that confer varying degrees of predisposition to type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Monogenic causes of type 2 diabetes represent only a small fraction of cases and commonly inherited polymorphisms individually contribute only small degrees of risk for, or protection from, diabetes. Most of the genetic risk for type 2 diabetes results from complex polygenic risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Genetic susceptibility'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by noninsulin-dependent diabetes diagnosed at a young age (&lt;25 years) with autosomal dominant transmission and lack of autoantibodies. It is classified by the underlying genetic defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83071\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83071 \">table 2</a>). Many patients with MODY are misclassified as having either type 1 or 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Maturity onset diabetes of the young'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of MODY is made by performing diagnostic genetic testing by direct sequencing of the gene. Laboratories in several countries offer clinical testing, primarily for mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor-4-alpha (<em>HNF4A</em>), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-alpha (<em>HNF1A</em>), and the glucokinase (<em>GCK)</em> gene. (See <a href=\"#H3754064\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We typically perform genetic testing for MODY when there is a high index of suspicion (familial diabetes with autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance (&gt;2 generations), onset &lt;25 years, nonobese, negative islet autoantibodies) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83072 \">table 3</a>). For family members of mutation carriers, biochemical testing to confirm diabetes should be performed before genetic testing is considered. If the biochemical tests are consistent with a diagnosis of diabetes, genetic testing can be performed to confirm the diagnosis of a MODY mutation. (See <a href=\"#H4885959\" class=\"local\">'Indications for genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases that damage the pancreas, or removal of pancreatic tissue, can result in diabetes. There is wide variability in the frequency with which this occurs, primarily determined by the degree of pancreatic insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68883 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diseases of the exocrine pancreas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several endocrinopathies, including Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, and pheochromocytoma, can lead to abnormalities in glucose regulation. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Endocrinopathies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large number of drugs can impair glucose tolerance; they act by decreasing insulin secretion, increasing hepatic glucose production, or causing resistance to the action of insulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67257\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67257 \">table 5</a>).
