In the disease name, &quot;diffuse&quot; refers to the distribution of the lesions throughout both lungs and &quot;pan&quot; refers to the pathologic finding that the inflammation involves all layers of the respiratory bronchioles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The predisposing factors, clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of diffuse panbronchiolitis will be discussed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of other types of bronchiolitis in adults and children are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact pathogenesis of DPB is not known. A variety of genetic, environmental, and systemic factors appear to contribute.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic factors are suspected to contribute to the pathogenesis of DPB based on the observation of familial cases and the association of specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes with the disease. In addition to familial cases noted in Japan, it is also common to identify chronic sinusitis without bronchiolitis in first-degree relatives of afflicted individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>Specific HLA haplotypes, such as HLA-B54 in Japan and HLA-A11 in Korea, are associated with the development of DPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In one report, for example, HLA-B54 was identified in 63 percent of Japanese patients with DPB versus 11 percent of normal Japanese controls (relative risk 13.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This HLA haplotype has been reported almost exclusively in natives of Japan, China, and Korea, where it is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis and silicosis.</p><p>The association of particular HLA-A and HLA-B haplotypes with DPB suggests that a disease susceptibility gene might be located between these loci in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I region on chromosome 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In a study of this candidate region, affected patients were found to have polymorphisms in two novel mucin-like genes called panbronchiolitis-related mucin-like 1 and 2 (also known as mucin 22 or <em>MUC22</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>A separate study similarly suggests a contribution from mucin-related genes. An <span class=\"nowrap\">insertion/deletion</span> polymorphism of the mucin gene MUC5B on chromosome 11 is associated with DPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Immunohistochemical staining of lung biopsy samples from patients with DPB demonstrated markedly increased expression of MUC5B-positive secretions in the lower respiratory tract of patients with DPB, compared to normal control samples. </p><p>Several other candidate genes, including those encoding interleukin (IL)-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha have been associated with an increased risk of DPB in small studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Despite clinical similarities (eg, sinusitis, bronchiectasis) to the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis (a disease not described in the Japanese population), abnormalities in exocrine function, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, and sweat electrolytes have <strong>not</strong> been identified in patients with DPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nongenetic factors have also been considered in the etiology and pathogenesis of DPB.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental cofactors appear to play a role, since DPB is rarely seen in people of Asian ancestry living abroad. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of an underlying systemic disease is suggested by a case reports in which DPB recurred in the lung allograft within 10 to 16 weeks after lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A potential role for lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of DPB is suggested by the prominence of lymphocytes in and around the bronchioles on histopathology and in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Macrolide antibiotics, used to treat DPB, significantly reduce the number of lymphocytes and activated CD8+ cells in BALF of patients with DPB, and also increase the <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/CD8</span> ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These findings suggest activation of CD8+ cells in the airway lumen of DPB patients, further supporting the hypothesis that lymphocytes are important contributors to the bronchial inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BALF also usually shows an increase in the number of neutrophils, although the role of neutrophils in DPB is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. On histopathology, they are not significant components of tissue-based inflammation. It is possible that the presence of neutrophils in the lumen is a response to airway bacterial colonization. Neutrophils may contribute to development of bronchiectasis proximal to the affected bronchioles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal regulation and expression of human beta-defensins (antimicrobial peptides involved in innate host defense) may play a role in the pathogenesis of DPB. This theory is supported by the finding that patients with DPB have elevated levels of human beta-defensin-1 and -2 in BALF, and increased serum levels of human beta-defensin-2, compared to control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Serum levels of human beta-defensin-2 appear to correlate with disease activity, and therapy with macrolide antibiotics reduced serum human beta-defensin-2 in one small study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DPB occurs mainly among the Japanese and has rarely been reported outside East Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. However, cases of DPB have been recognized in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe, raising concerns that it might be under-diagnosed in these populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/23-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-30</a>]. As clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists become familiar with this entity, the number of cases identified worldwide may substantially increase. The disorder is slightly more prevalent in men (approximately 1.4 to 2:1, male to female ratio) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>]. The majority of patients are nonsmokers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of DPB typically develop in the second to fifth decade (mean age at presentation 40 years) and are slowly progressive over months to years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/2,21,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21,31</a>]. Often patients have failed prior short-term treatment courses with nonmacrolide antibiotics. In case series, the time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was in the range of one to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Common symptoms and signs at presentation include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/2,19,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19,31,32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic sinusitis, found in at least 75 percent of Japanese patients with DPB, often preceding chest symptoms by years or even decades</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough, usually productive of copious amounts of purulent sputum, exceeding 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> in half of untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathlessness with exertion, which usually develops several months after the onset of cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of wheezing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss, especially when pulmonary symptoms become progressive and severe</p><p/><p>Chest examination may reveal decreased breath sounds, coarse crackles, or wheezes.

However, rheumatoid factor can be present at a low level in DPB.</p><p/><p>Among patients with DPB, the following nonspecific findings may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/2,19,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19,33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild peripheral blood neutrophilia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased serum IgA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive C-reactive protein</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15291324\"><span class=\"h2\">Sputum stain and culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a chronic productive cough, sputum samples are usually obtained for gram stain, acid fast stain, and cultures (including mycobacterial). Sputum cultures have grown <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> in 44 percent and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> in 22 percent of patients with DPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]. The frequency of <em>P aeruginosa</em> can increase to 60 percent after four years of treatment. In early disease, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> may be seen, but less commonly than the above organisms. Mycobacterial cultures are obtained as infection with these organisms is in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H18301849\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function tests are obtained in most patients to evaluate whether a patient with a chronic cough or dyspnea has a pattern consistent with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whether there is a concomitant gas transfer defect, and also to assess the severity of the respiratory impairment.</p><p>In DPB, an obstructive defect is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], although a mixed obstructive-restrictive pattern may also be seen. Patients with DPB exhibit less airway hyperresponsiveness than those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The diffusing capacity (DLCO) is variably reduced. Hypoxemia is common, while hypercapnia occurs in the terminal stages of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A conventional chest radiograph is typically obtained to evaluate adults with dyspnea and a persistent productive cough. In DPB, the chest radiograph can reveal several different abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/26,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35-37</a>]. These include normal or hyperinflated lung volumes, diffuse ill-defined nodules up to 3 mm in diameter, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increase in bronchovascular markings (reticular &quot;airway&quot; pattern).

In DPB, the HRCT scan may show centrilobular nodular opacities, nodular and linear (tree-in-bud) opacities corresponding to bronchioles with intraluminal mucous plugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63211\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63211 \">image 1</a>), thickened and dilated bronchiolar walls (bronchiolectasis), and, as a late finding, large cystic opacities accompanied by dilated proximal bronchi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. A diffuse pattern, uniformly identifiable throughout the lungs is suggestive of panbronchiolitis, while a focal pattern is more commonly seen with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, cystic fibrosis, or mycobacterial infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution computed tomography of the lungs&quot;, section on 'Centrilobular nodules'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inhomogeneity in lung density, as a result of peripheral air trapping, may also be seen, although this is less common. Expiratory images may enhance the airway trapping due to the obstructed airways.

Cellular analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) usually shows increased numbers of lymphocytes and neutrophils, although the presence of neutrophils may be a response to local bacterial superinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/16,17,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,39</a>]. </p><p>Transbronchial biopsy is more helpful to identify other processes (eg, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis), than to secure a diagnosis of DPB. The low sensitivity of transbronchial biopsy for DPB was illustrated in a study of eight patients who underwent transbronchial biopsy prior to a surgical lung biopsy that showed DPB; all eight transbronchial biopsies showed nonspecific inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However, for patients living in countries with a low prevalence of DPB and those with atypical features, lung biopsy is typically obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or thoracotomy in order to confirm the diagnosis because no other findings are specific for the diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histologic lesion of DPB is centered around the respiratory bronchiole and consists of a transmural infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and distinctive lipid-laden &quot;foamy&quot; macrophages, also known as foam cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77745\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77745 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57780\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57780 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/24,31,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31,40-42</a>]. Mucus and acute inflammatory cells fill the lumen of affected airways and alveoli, although the alveolar walls are spared.</p><p>Narrowing of the lumen of these small airways occurs as the disease progresses. However, obliterative bronchiolitis with submucosal fibrosis is not a prominent feature. Persistent inflammation and superinfection combine to produce secondary ectasia of more proximal bronchioles in advanced disease. Hyperplasia of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue is also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The panbronchiolitis (PB) lesion (chronic inflammation of membranous and respiratory bronchioles and prominent interstitial foam cells) is a <strong>not</strong> a specific histologic finding. A PB-like lesion has been reported in pathologic specimens of at least 11 other diseases (eg, constrictive bronchiolitis, follicular bronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, aspiration pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonia, bronchocentric granulomatosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, when a PB-like lesion is found in these other diseases, the airways with the most marked changes are the proximal membranous bronchioles rather than the respiratory bronchioles. Alternatively, the PB-lesion is a minor finding and other histologic lesions (eg, poorly formed granulomas, lymphoma, vasculitis) lead to the specific diagnosis. Thus, the diagnosis of DPB can be made only in the appropriate clinical setting, with careful histopathologic analysis, and when other conditions have been carefully ruled out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11949013\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In countries where DPB is prevalent, a lung biopsy is often not needed to make the diagnosis, and clinical criteria for DPB are used instead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Unlike DPB, patients with CF often have extrapulmonary manifestations: in childhood, failure to thrive, steatorrhea, and meconium ileus are common, while in adulthood, pancreatitis, nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, diabetes mellitus, and infertility are common. The diagnosis of CF is made based on sweat chloride results and analysis for mutations in the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene.

The Cochrane review did conclude that the use of low-dose macrolides according to current guidelines was a reasonable approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffuse-panbronchiolitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9578552\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of action of macrolides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms by which macrolide antibiotics exert their beneficial effect in DPB may include both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. In the treatment of DPB, the serum and sputum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> levels are below the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the common superinfecting organisms, suggesting that antimicrobial effects may be less important than anti-inflammatory effects.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary function tests typically show an obstructive defect, although a mixed obstructive-restrictive pattern may also be seen. Diffusing capacity (DLCO) is variably reduced. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chest radiograph findings in DPB include normal or hyperinflated lung volumes, diffuse ill-defined nodules up to 3 mm in diameter, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increase in bronchovascular markings. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning typically shows centrilobular nodular and linear opacities corresponding to thickened and dilated bronchiolar walls with intraluminal mucous plugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63211\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63211 \">image 1</a>). Inhomogeneity in lung density, due to peripheral air trapping, may also be seen. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In countries where the prevalence of DPB is high, a lung biopsy is not usually needed, and the diagnosis is based on the presence of specific clinical criteria described above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86536 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Lung biopsy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11949013\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In countries where DPB is infrequent, lung biopsy is generally needed to confirm the clinical suspicion and exclude alternative causes because no noninvasive clinical or radiological findings are sufficiently specific. The characteristic histopathologic features of DPB are centered on the respiratory bronchiole and consist of a transmural infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and distinctive lipid-laden &quot;foamy&quot; macrophages, also known as foam cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77745\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77745 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57780\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57780 \">picture 2</a>).

These can typically be excluded on the basis of clinical features and routine evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H18301849\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21489965\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend using a macrolide antibiotic in all patients diagnosed with DPB (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The agent of first choice is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> 400 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> due to the greater clinical experience with it. For patients who are unable to tolerate erythromycin or do not improve, alternative macrolides include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, roxithromycin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Macrolide antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal duration of therapy is unknown, but most patients are treated for 6 to 24 months. The longer duration of therapy is used in patients with extensive bronchiectasis or a recurrence of disease after cessation of therapy. Occasional patients with recurrent disease need indefinite therapy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Macrolide antibiotics'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled beta 2 agonists <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anticholinergic agents may be helpful adjunctive therapy for symptomatic control of cough and sputum production. Systemic glucocorticoids are not beneficial in DPB. (See <a href=\"#H9578907\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with advanced airway scarring and bronchiectasis due to DPB may experience exacerbations due to bacterial superinfection (without evidence of recurrent DPB) that require treatment with broad-spectrum, as determined by sputum gram stain and culture. (See <a href=\"#H5806730\" class=\"local\">'Exacerbations of bronchiectasis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment of acute exacerbations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in patients with DPB is not known. Treatment of CRS may help alleviate symptoms such as cough and sputum production. We typically follow the treatment outlined for CRS without nasal polyposis which is described separately.
