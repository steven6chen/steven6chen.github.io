It can result in compromise of airways, great vessels, and other mediastinal structures, with morbidity directly related to the location and extent of fibrosis. Fibrosing mediastinitis is usually a sequel of histoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The etiology, natural history, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of fibrosing mediastinitis are reviewed here. The presentation and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrosing mediastinitis usually results from an excessive host response to a prior infection that involved the mediastinal lymph nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141984\"><span class=\"h2\">Histoplasmosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of cases of fibrosing mediastinitis are thought to be sequelae of infection with <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, a dimorphic fungus that is found commonly in the southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and central United States. Infection with <em>H. capsulatum</em> is subclinical in the vast majority of patients. It begins as an asymptomatic pulmonary infection and disseminates to the mediastinal lymph nodes and other reticuloendothelial organs before specific cell-mediated immunity develops and contains the fungus. Depending upon the inoculum and the extent of host response, the involved mediastinal lymph nodes can enlarge and coalesce into an inflamed caseous mass referred to as a mediastinal granuloma, or can lead to a sclerosing process called fibrosing mediastinitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mediastinal granuloma &ndash; Mediastinal granuloma is more common (comprises 5 to 10 percent of mediastinal masses in most surgical series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]) and more benign than fibrosing mediastinitis. It usually presents as a mediastinal mass that is discovered either incidentally or because it compresses compliant mediastinal structures such as the superior vena cava (SVC) or esophagus. The mediastinal granuloma consists of encapsulated caseous lymph nodes that are easily removed surgically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrosing mediastinitis &ndash; The events that lead to the development and perpetuation of fibrosing mediastinitis are incompletely understood. It is believed that fibrosing mediastinitis results from the leakage of fungal antigens from lymph nodes into the mediastinal space, leading to a hypersensitivity reaction followed by an exuberant fibrotic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fibroblasts adjacent to evolving granulomata are stimulated and proliferate, leading to fibrosis, entrapment, and invasion of adjacent normal structures. The resulting tissue pathology consists of caseous central foci surrounded by mature, concentrically deposited acellular collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fibrosing mediastinitis is not believed to reflect extranodal infection because the organism cannot typically be cultured from biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is unknown why only a minority of patients infected with <em>H. capsulatum</em> develop fibrosing mediastinitis. However, genetic influences on the immune response may play a role. This was suggested by a case-control study that included 19 consecutive patients with fibrosing mediastinitis and 21,086 cadaveric kidney donors serving as controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The study found that the relative risk of fibrosing mediastinitis was 3.3 among persons with the HLA-A2 antigen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Some investigators contend that mediastinal granuloma and fibrosing mediastinitis are separate disease processes, with fibrosing mediastinitis occurring idiosyncratically in people predisposed to excessive fibrogenesis in response to antigenic stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Others believe that fibrosing mediastinitis is due to the rupture of mediastinal granulomas into the mediastinal space, leading to a fibrotic host response. In support of the latter hypothesis, one series of 31 patients with mediastinal granuloma found that 11 patients (35 percent) developed fibrosing mediastinitis over a two-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other precipitants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculosis is often included as a potential precipitant of fibrosing mediastinitis, but it rarely stimulates an invasive fibrotic reaction similar to that seen following histoplasmosis. However, mediastinal granulomas due to tuberculosis are well described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Case reports have also described the development of fibrosing mediastinitis secondary to mediastinal radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or infection with <em>Aspergillus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>], <em>Wuchereria bancrofti</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], or <em>Blastomyces</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In a series of 27 patients from France with pulmonary hypertension due to fibrosing mediastinitis, the most common underlying cause was sarcoidosis (13 patients or 48 percent), while tuberculosis was found in nine patients (33 percent). The absence of suspected histoplasmosis suggests that the cause of fibrosing mediastinitis is highly dependent upon location and the likelihood of an underlying endemic fungus.</p><p>An idiopathic form of fibrosing mediastinitis has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Unlike patients with fibrosing mediastinitis believed to be due to histoplasmosis, patients with the idiopathic form lack calcification on imaging studies. The idiopathic form of fibrosing mediastinitis may be autoimmune and can in some cases be associated with fibrosing processes in other sites, such as retroperitoneal fibrosis, orbital pseudotumor, and Riedel's (fibrous) thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precise data regarding the incidence of fibrosing mediastinitis are not available, but the condition appears to be rare. While it has been estimated that over 500,000 people per year in the United States are infected with Histoplasma and over 80 percent of inhabitants of endemic regions have a positive Histoplasma skin test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], less than 1 percent of patients with histoplasmosis develop fibrosing mediastinitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75641\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75641 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The largest series of fibrosing mediastinitis was from an institution in an endemic region and it described only 94 patients over a nine-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The average age at diagnosis was 33 years, 81 percent of patients were white, and there was a slight male preponderance. Similar demographics have been reported by other series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141910\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrosing mediastinitis is an insidious, progressive disease with a variable natural history. One series of 23 patients found that 10 patients (43 percent) had improvements in symptoms, 11 patients (48 percent) had no significant change, and two patients (9 percent) had progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In contrast, a second series of 71 patients noted a far worse prognosis, with 21 patients (30 percent) dying during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The mean interval between the development of symptoms and death was less than six years in these patients, and death resulted most frequently from cor pulmonale or relentless respiratory compromise due to recurrent infection, bronchial obstruction, or hemoptysis. Disease involving subcarinal structures conferred a worse prognosis because bilateral lung involvement was more common in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of fibrosing mediastinitis depend upon which structures of the mediastinum are involved and the degree to which those structures are compromised. Typical complications result from compromise of the airways, heart and great vessels, or esophagus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway compression can lead to postobstructive pneumonia or atelectasis, while bronchial erosion by calcific lymph nodes can lead to broncholithiasis. These complications are most common in the right upper lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart and great vessel involvement can cause pulmonary artery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary vein obstruction, constrictive pericarditis, or superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50957\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50957 \">image 1</a>). Not all patients with SVC compromise become symptomatic. SVC obstruction due to fibrosing mediastinitis typically develops slowly over a period of years, allowing the formation of an extensive collateral circulation that may be adequate to prevent both stasis and elevated pressure in the tributaries of the SVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>]. SVC obstruction is a less common presentation of fibrosing mediastinitis than tracheobronchial narrowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal compression can lead to dysphagia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> odynophagia. Tracheoesophageal fistula formation may also be seen.</p><p/><p>Hemoptysis may also occur in fibrosing mediastinitis. It is a consequence of any of four possible mechanisms. Fibrous tissue can invade a bronchus and extend into the mucosa, leading to a friable intraluminal lesion. Airway obstruction may result in a postobstructive necrotizing pneumonia. Obstruction of pulmonary venous return may produce pulmonary venous hypertension (pseudo-mitral stenosis). And, finally, obstruction of pulmonary arteries can lead to extensive functional anastomoses between the intercostal or bronchial arteries and the pulmonary arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2489539\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average interval from initial symptoms to diagnosis is five years for women and 2.2 years for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Imaging studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of an infiltrative process in the mediastinum, to help exclude malignancy, and to assess the integrity of mediastinal structures. We feel that a biopsy should not be done if the patient has a typical clinical and radiologic presentation with associated calcification. Biopsies are difficult because of the dense fibrosis and calcification and may be hazardous as a result of bleeding from engorged collateral vessels. Serologic studies are of limited benefit because they frequently fail to establish the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2489546\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic studies performed on patients with suspected fibrosing mediastinitis may include chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), CT angiography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiographs &ndash; The findings of fibrosing mediastinitis on chest radiographs are nonspecific, with common findings including hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, lobar or segmental consolidation or atelectasis, a unilateral small pulmonary artery, septal lines, pleural effusion, or cardiomegaly. The extent of disease is often underestimated, with the chest radiograph appearing relatively normal even in patients with extensive disease (ie, disease causing major central airway obstruction and vascular occlusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography &ndash; CT can reveal an infiltrative mediastinal process that obliterates fat planes, with or without a discrete mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20,21</a>]. It often demonstrates calcifications within the mediastinal process, which are not evident on the chest radiograph but suggest nonmalignant disease. In one series, 86 percent of patients had calcification on their CT scan, approximately 50 percent of which were not visible on the chest radiograph alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. CT may also reveal evidence of prior Histoplasma infection, such as calcified lymph nodes and splenic calcifications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT angiography &ndash; CT angiography is useful in assessing the degree of vascular occlusion and demonstrating collateral blood flow around obstructed vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>]. Increased lung attenuation, thickened interlobular septa, and peribronchial cuffing are usually seen with pulmonary venous obstruction. When these findings are combined with an area of tracheobronchial narrowing, the diagnosis of fibrosing mediastinitis is favored over lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging &ndash; MRI of fibrosing mediastinitis typically reveals a mass of heterogeneous signal intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images is suggestive of fibrosis. MRI may be superior at defining the extent of disease (particularly the degree of vascular involvement) compared to CT, but is less useful for demonstrating intralesional calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>].</p><p/><p>Generally speaking, invasive procedures may be hazardous because of pulmonary hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the potential for pulmonary hemorrhage. This was demonstrated by a case series of 71 patients, which reported two deaths from hemorrhage complicating bronchoscopy and two deaths complicating cardiac catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no curative therapy for fibrosing mediastinitis. Antifungal agents are generally ineffective, although several case reports have suggested a potential benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3,18,20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18,20,25</a>]. Glucocorticoids do not appear to be beneficial in typical cases of fibrosing mediastinitis, although controlled trials have not been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26</a>]. However, in fibrosing mediastinitis due to sarcoidosis, improvement may sometimes be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Another possible exception is autoimmune fibrosing mediastinitis, which may respond more favorably to glucocorticoid therapy, although these cases are difficult to identify prospectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Based upon the finding of CD20-positive B lymphocytes in tissue samples from patients with fibrosing mediastinitis, a preliminary report of off-label treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> reported a therapeutic response and reduction of both lesion size and metabolic activity in three patients with progressive and refractory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Bronchoscopically placed airway stents and percutaneously placed vascular stents have been used to treat airway obstruction and vascular obstruction, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Vascular stents may be effective in improving symptoms in patients with central vascular obstruction due to fibrosing mediastinitis. In a series from Vanderbilt University of 77 vascular stents placed in 40 patients to relieve lesions in the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, or superior vena cava, there were significant increases in vessel caliber and reductions in pressure gradients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Symptomatic improvement was reported in 87 percent of patients for whom follow-up was available. Procedure-related complications occurred in 24 percent, and symptomatic recurrent stenosis requiring further intervention occurred in 28 percent. </p><p>Airway dilation and placement of a silicone airway stent may be useful in selected cases of fibrosing mediastinitis complicated by severe extrinsic obstruction of central airways. In a report of seven patients from The Mayo Clinic undergoing airway dilation and silicone stent placement, airway remodeling allowing stent removal occurred in five patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, because of potential concomitant vascular obstruction in these patients, bronchoscopy may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Surgery has been performed to palliate symptoms by relieving airway, vascular, and esophageal obstruction, as well as managing tracheoesophageal fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/18,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,26</a>]. However, its success has been variable. Extensive fibrosis, calcification, and collateral vessels limit the benefits of surgery and are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/3,18,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18,26</a>]. This was illustrated by a series of 18 patients with fibrosing mediastinitis secondary to histoplasmosis, which reported three deaths (19 percent) during the early postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection of the stenotic airway <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the distal lung parenchyma has been done in cases of fibrosing mediastinitis complicated by recurrent postobstructive infection or poor gas exchange secondary to shunt physiology. Sleeve lobectomy, carinal resection, or pneumonectomy may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Airway surgery is technically difficult and associated with significant mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior vena cava (SVC) bypass surgery with a spiral vein graft has been used for symptomatic relief in some patients with SVC obstruction. The saphenous vein is harvested and then opened longitudinally through its entire length. It is then wrapped around a stent in a spiral manner and sutured together to create a bioprosthesis of the desired length and diameter. The stent is then removed and the graft is placed in the mediastinum anterior to the aorta. The largest series of patients treated in this fashion included four individuals with SVC syndrome due to fibrosing mediastinitis; all were symptom-free two years after the operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrosing-mediastinitis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141956\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare disorder characterized by an excessive fibrotic reaction in the mediastinum.
