A meta-analysis of 47 studies with 15,158 patients with cirrhosis found that, compared with no surveillance, surveillance was associated with improved early-stage detection (odds ratio [OR] 2.1), curative treatment rates (OR 2.2), and survival (OR 1.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

As noted above, patients without cirrhosis may better tolerate treatment for HCC than those with cirrhosis. In addition, small HCCs may be harder to detect in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. It is therefore important to know the proportion of the study participants with cirrhosis in order to interpret the results. Since the majority of Western patients undergoing HCC surveillance have cirrhosis due to causes other than HBV, it is not clear that the results of surveillance in a Western population will be as good as those seen in the Chinese study.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are no comparable studies for other forms of chronic liver disease. Despite the uncertain benefit in patients who do not have chronic HBV, surveillance is recommended by the AASLD for patients with a number of different liver diseases that cause cirrhosis because of an established increased risk of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/2,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,97</a>]. Additional studies are needed to determine whether the results seen in a group of patients primarily with chronic HBV (with or without cirrhosis) are reproducible in patients with cirrhosis due to various causes. (See <a href=\"#H61643912\" class=\"local\">'Patients who require surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTING RISK IN INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance efforts could be improved if the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could be predicted with sufficient accuracy in individual patients. A number of risk factors for HCC have been identified and in some cases have been incorporated into risk scores, although many have not been extensively-validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/26,44,98-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,44,98-109</a>]. </p><p>One study proposed a nomogram that predicted individual risk in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV, genotypes B and C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. This nomogram has now been validated and a 17-point risk score has been developed that accurately predicted risk of HCC in patients with HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Variables included in the score include sex, age, serum alanine aminotransferase concentration, hepatitis B e antigen status, and serum HBV DNA level. Patients may score between 0 and 17 points. A score of 0 corresponds to a 10-year risk of HCC of 0 percent, a score of 8 corresponds to a risk of 2 percent, and a score of 17 corresponds to a risk of 82 percent. The major drawback is that the score was developed in Asia and has been validated in Asia, where more patients are infected with hepatitis B genotypes B and C. Although the relationship probably also holds for other genotypes, the cut-points have not been determined, so this score may only be useful in an Asian population. </p><p>A simple risk score for HCC in Caucasian patients with chronic HBV on antiviral therapy includes the patient&rsquo;s age, gender and platelet count, but this risk score has not been validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. </p><p>HBV genotype is important in assessing risk for HCC. The prevalence of specific genotypes varies geographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/112-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">112-114</a>]. Genotype A is found mainly in Northern Europe, North America, India, and Africa, whereas genotypes B and C are prevalent in Asia, and genotype D is more common in Southern Europe, the Middle East, and India. Patients with genotype C are at higher risk for HCC than patients with genotype B, and patients with genotype D are at higher risk than patients with genotype A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/107,115,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,115,116</a>]. Generally, a patient's country of origin can be used as a surrogate for his or her genotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical significance of hepatitis B virus genotypes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of HCC in an individual patient may progress with advancing liver disease, but it may not be practical to monitor patients for a change in risk and modify surveillance strategies accordingly. Thus, surveillance recommendations are based mainly upon an overall assessment of the expected incidence of HCC in specific populations of patients with liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H61643912\" class=\"local\">'Patients who require surveillance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H61645279\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance methods'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">COST-EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While the models focused on different populations and interventions, most found that some form of surveillance was cost-effective but that the cost-effectiveness depended mainly upon the expected incidence of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/117-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">117-120</a>].</p><p>Interventions are often considered to be cost-effective if they cost less than $50,000 per year of life gained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. As a general rule, surveillance appears to be cost-effective in patients with cirrhosis who have an expected annual incidence of HCC exceeding 1.5 percent per year. The incidence of HCC in various forms of cirrhotic liver disease ranges from 3 to 8 percent, making surveillance cost-effective for many patients with cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68371 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/35,41,83,104,119,122-127\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,41,83,104,119,122-127</a>]. For patients with hepatitis B, surveillance appears to be cost-effective once the incidence of HCC exceeds 0.2 percent per year. (See <a href=\"#H61643912\" class=\"local\">'Patients who require surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82322687\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE RATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite screening recommendations, most patients with cirrhosis who are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) do not receive regular surveillance. In two large series from Veterans Affairs facilities in the United States, regular surveillance was performed in only 2 to 12 percent of patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/128,129\" class=\"abstract_t\">128,129</a>]. Factors associated with regular surveillance included the presence of fewer medical and psychological comorbid conditions, varices, and compensated liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. A review from the SEER Medicare databases found that less than 20 percent of patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC had undergone regular surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. </p><p>In another study from the Veteran Administration in the United States, patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease related HCC did not undergo surveillance within three years prior to the diagnosis of HCC compared with alcohol or hepatitis C related HCC (57 versus 40 versus 13 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF NODULES DISCOVERED ON ULTRASOUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal evaluation of a liver nodule found on ultrasound depends upon the lesion size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The diagnosis is confirmed if the appearance is typical for HCC (arterial hypervascularity and venous phase washout). If the appearance is not typical, the alternate procedure should be performed (eg, CT scan if the first test was an MRI). Again, the diagnosis is confirmed if the appearance is typical for HCC; if not, a biopsy is required. This approach has appeared to be effective in validation studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/132,133\" class=\"abstract_t\">132,133</a>]. However, it is important to note that a negative biopsy does not exclude HCC, and further monitoring (eg, ultrasound at three to six month intervals) is required. If the lesion enlarges during follow-up but remains atypical for HCC, a repeat biopsy is recommended.
