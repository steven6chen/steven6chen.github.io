During the first few years of life, a number of important developmental changes occur, leading to the expected adult <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>This topic review will describe normal <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> patterns in infancy and childhood. This will provide background for an evaluative approach to sleep problems in children, which is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of sleep disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sleep stages and architecture in adults are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SLEEP STATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two distinct sleep states have been identified based on specific physiological variables: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Standardized methods have been developed with regard to scoring sleep states in infants, children, and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>REM sleep is a physiologically distinct state, characterized by an activated pattern on electroencephalogram&nbsp;(EEG; similar in some respects to wakefulness) associated with marked decrease in muscle tone and episodic bursts of REM. Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NREM sleep is subdivided into three discrete stages based primarily on the EEG. The stages range from N1 (the lightest and often initial stage of sleep) to N3 (deep NREM sleep with a high arousal threshold); N3 corresponds to what was previously scored as stages 3 and 4.</p><p/><p>REM sleep was first characterized in 1953 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In 1966, Roffwarg and colleagues sparked interest in the developmental aspects of sleep when they reported that newborns spend significantly more time in REM sleep as compared with older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These investigators postulated that activation of key portions of the central and autonomic nervous system during REM sleep contributed to functional maturation. This hypothesis helped explain a number of differences in the sleep of infants compared with adults, as described below. Availability of all-night polysomnography in children has allowed more precise characterization of sleep architecture and has improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of many sleep disorders in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MATURATION OF SLEEP ARCHITECTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-wake patterns become more diurnal, and sleep times gradually decrease from infancy through adolescence, as shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82604 \">figure 1</a>). Sleep time of children in a given age group varies by as much as two hours. In addition, sleep patterns and behaviors have changed over time, such that sleep duration in equivalent age groups has declined, presumably reflecting sociocultural changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Sleep times for children in the United States tend to be shorter than those in Europe and Australian series, especially on weekdays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In a survey of adolescents in the United States, more than 60 percent reported sleeping less than seven hours on weekday nights, substantially less than the 8 to 10 hours recommended for this age group by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F109426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109426 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep in the healthy full-term newborn is distinguished from that of older individuals by [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer sleep duration (16 to 18 hours per 24 hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep occurring at sleep onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased proportion of REM sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>REM-nonrapid eye movement (NREM) cycle much shorter in duration as compared with older individuals</p><p/><p>With maturation of the child's central nervous system, predictable changes occur, including gradual decrease in total sleep time and the proportion of REM sleep, progressive lengthening of the REM-NREM cycle, and shift to the adult pattern of sleep onset via NREM sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Children and adolescents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal older children and adolescents, sleep is characterized by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset via NREM sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NREM sleep occupying approximately 75 percent of total sleep time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>REM and NREM sleep alternating throughout the night with a period of 90 to 100 minutes, and a progressive lengthening of the duration of REM sleep periods in the final one-third of the night.</p><p/><p>Sleep in adolescents is further characterized by [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-physiology-in-children/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease in slow-wave sleep beginning in puberty and continuing into adulthood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiological shift in sleep onset to a later time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing irregularity of sleep-wake patterns (primarily discrepancy between weeknights and weekend sleep patterns). &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease in average sleep <strong>duration </strong>despite relatively stable sleep <strong>requirement </strong>of about nine hours<strong> </strong></p><p/><p>A more detailed discussion of sleep stages and sleep architecture in adults is presented elsewhere.

Certain features of wakefulness and sleep occur simultaneously.
