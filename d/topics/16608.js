Techniques include preoperative autologous donation, intraoperative hemodilution, and blood salvage (also called cell salvage) during surgery.</p><p>This topic will review the indications, advantages, and potential complications of intraoperative blood salvage (ie, intraoperative autologous transfusion or intraoperative autotransfusion) and postoperative blood salvage. Other perioperative blood conservation techniques are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Intraoperative hemodilution&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86181585\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAOPERATIVE BLOOD SALVAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest intraoperative blood salvage in surgical procedures having a high likelihood of significant blood loss (&gt;1000 mL), based on evidence that allogeneic transfusion and associated complications can be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] with a very low incidence of adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380732602\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative blood salvage has the following potential benefits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of allogeneic transfusion</strong> &ndash; The technique can be effective in avoiding or reducing allogeneic blood transfusion, with its attendant costs and risks (eg, transfusion reactions, transfusion-transmitted infections) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, intraoperative blood salvage is presumed to be beneficial, although randomized trials have not demonstrated improved outcomes. In a 2010 systematic review including 75 trials (36 involving orthopedic procedures, 33 involving cardiac procedures, 6 involving vascular surgery), the absolute reduction in the use of allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was 21 percent (95% CI 15-26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a 2015 systematic review in emergency abdominal or thoracic trauma surgery (one trial; n = 44), the reduction in the use of allogeneic RBCs in the cell salvage group was 4.7 units (95% CI 1.31-8.09 units) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These systematic reviews concluded that cell salvage did not increase the risk of adverse events, including mortality and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H89426930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Risks and complications of transfusion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intraoperative blood salvage has been applied effectively in a variety of surgical procedures having a high likelihood of requiring a transfusion, whether elective or emergent, including cardiac, vascular, orthopedic, urologic, trauma, gynecologic, and transplantation procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/1,3-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-16</a>]. Intraoperative blood salvage has also been effective in neurosurgery and plastic surgery cases with a high likelihood of blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intraoperative blood salvage may also be acceptable to some Jehovah's Witnesses, who will not accept allogeneic blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Requirements for acceptance by these patients may include assurance that the blood does not leave the operating room for processing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> that the blood remains continuously connected to the patient via intravenous tubing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The approach to the patient who refuses blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Jehovah's Witnesses'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intraoperative blood salvage may be lifesaving in patients with a rare blood type or multiple RBC alloantibodies when crossmatch-compatible blood cannot readily be obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Greater number of units available compared with other autologous blood conservation techniques</strong> &ndash; Intraoperative blood salvage complements other methods of blood conservation, but has the potential to deliver much larger amounts of blood than either preoperative autologous donation or intraoperative hemodilution, which generally only provide 1 to 3 units of autologous blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Time and cost savings </strong>&ndash; Intraoperative blood salvage is usually done in the operating room without direct involvement of the transfusion service and also eliminates the need for the patient to provide autologous donations. Thus, intraoperative salvage may save time for the patient and the blood collection facility. The cost of intraoperative blood salvage is at least equivalent to allogeneic transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/3,4,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is uncertainty regarding the need for blood salvage, the collection disposables for a cell salvage device can be set up as a &quot;standby&quot; option, potentially saving the cost of the bowl and reinfusion bag, as well as personnel costs. This option has a similar cost to crossmatching 2 units of allogeneic blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are both absolute and relative contraindications to the use of intraoperative blood salvage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24963458\"><span class=\"h3\">Absolute contraindications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Presence of contraindicated fluids</strong> &ndash; Salvaged blood must never be mixed with fluids, such as sterile water or any hypotonic solution because RBC hemolysis will occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,28</a>]. Also, intraoperative blood salvage cannot proceed if solutions that would be toxic with intravascular administration could come into contact with the salvaged blood. Examples include antibiotic irrigation or hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, or povidone-iodine solutions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Admixture with hemostatic products or bone cement </strong>&ndash; Blood salvage cannot be used during suctioning of blood from the surgical field when there is any potential for simultaneous collection of hemostatic products such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombin-topical-human-and-bovine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical thrombin</a>, fibrin glue, or microfibrillar bovine collagen-based products (eg, Avitene, Actifoam Collagen Sponge, Ultrafoam Sponge, Instat, Helitene, or similar products), or any chance of admixture with methyl methacrylate (ie, bone cement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24963465\"><span class=\"h3\">Relative contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following relative contraindications are controversial, in that there is no compelling evidence to suggest an association with adverse outcomes. Notably, use of intraoperative blood salvage in these settings has been expanded without clear-cut negative consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacterial infections</strong> &ndash; Decisions about using intraoperative blood salvage in patients with bacterial infections are made on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of relative risks and benefits for the individual patient, and with informed consent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bacterial contamination of the surgical wound has traditionally been a contraindication to use of intraoperative blood salvage. However, small studies support the appropriateness of more liberal use of intraoperative blood salvage in this setting. In a case series of intraoperative blood salvage in 11 hemorrhaging trauma patients with enterically contaminated wounds, rapid access to a large volume of autologous blood for reinfusion was potentially lifesaving; no patient developed intraabdominal sepsis, and no deaths were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A 2015 systematic review in emergency abdominal or thoracic trauma surgery (one trial; n = 44) noted no difference in sepsis (measured by blood cultures) or mortality in the cell salvage group compared with the control group receiving allogeneic blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A study that retrospectively evaluated clinical outcomes in 36 patients who received salvaged blood during cardiac surgery found no clinical sequelae in the third of patients who were transfused with blood found to contain bacteria or endotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no reports of bacteremia and sepsis in otherwise healthy people who were transfused with salvaged blood containing bacteria in the intraoperative period. Absence of clinical sequelae may be attributable to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in surgical patients, irrigation of surgical wounds before resuming salvage procedures when contamination occurs, and the thorough washing and filtration process used for intraoperative cell salvage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although washing blood that contains bacteria cannot completely sterilize it, processing blood via a cell salvage system and then filtering it using a leukocyte reduction filter has been associated with a 98 to 100 percent reduction in a variety of bacterial organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Thus, decisions regarding reinfusion of salvaged blood in the setting of systemic infection should consider the potential infection risk of this technique compared with the known risk of postoperative infection after transfusion of allogeneic blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H89426930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Risks and complications of transfusion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Active malignancy</strong> &ndash; Decisions about using intraoperative blood salvage in patients with active malignancy are made on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of factors such as the risk of major intraoperative bleeding, the need for transfusion, the availability of allogeneic blood, and informed patient consent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The successful use of intraoperative blood salvage in cancer surgery supports more liberal use of the technique in patients with active malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Malignant cells have been observed in shed blood collected intraoperatively, and extensive cell washing does not remove these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, leukocyte depletion filters have been shown to remove tumor cells from salvaged blood, similar to their ability to remove bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-40</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1144393513\" class=\"local\">'Reinfusion'</a> below). Importantly, in a 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis including 10 controlled but not randomized studies, patients who received salvaged autologous blood during oncology surgery had no increase in cancer recurrence or development of metastases compared with those receiving allogeneic blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3444865661\"><span class=\"h2\">Areas of uncertainty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative blood salvage has been used successfully in the following settings, with continuing research to clarify its risks and benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16,28,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,28,41,42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obstetrics</strong> &ndash; Blood salvage, if available, can be helpful in managing patients with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) during cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. Preoperative planning for its use is prudent in obstetric patients at high risk for significant PPH, such as those with placenta accreta. Blood salvage in this setting is discussed separately.

If intraoperative blood salvage is used in a patient with known cold agglutinin disease, the reinfused blood should be passed through a blood warmer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5847575\"><span class=\"h2\">Technology and procedural steps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intraoperative cell salvage machine (commonly referred to as a &quot;cell saver&quot;) separates, washes, and concentrates salvaged RBCs. Several steps are involved, including suctioning of shed blood from the surgical field, addition of an anticoagulant, separation and washing of RBCs (to remove the anticoagulant, free hemoglobin molecules, activated thrombogenic substances, and cellular stroma), concentration of the blood, and eventual reinfusion to the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F100237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100237 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3738335453\"><span class=\"h3\">Aspiration of blood from the surgical field</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Centrifuge-based RBC salvage with the intraoperative cell salvage machine starts with the surgeon aspirating blood from the surgical field through a suction wand. The blood is mixed with an anticoagulant as it is aspirated (eg, heparin or citrate) to prevent coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Typically, heparin in saline with a concentration of approximately 30,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> is used. This solution is slowly and automatically added to the aspirated blood at a rate of 15 mL per 100 mL of collected blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. During subsequent washing of the collected blood, all but a trace of heparin is removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,47</a>].</p><p>If there is concern about heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a citrate-based <span class=\"nowrap\">anticoagulant/preservative</span> solution (eg, citrate-phosphate-dextrose [CPD] or citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine [CPD-A]) should be used instead of heparin. Citrate-containing solutions are administered at a rate of 15 mL per 100 mL of collected blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Citrate is rapidly metabolized by the liver after transfusion. Therefore, iatrogenic anticoagulation is unlikely with intraoperative blood salvage techniques. However, if there is concern about citrate-induced hypocalcemia (eg, due to impaired liver function, changes consistent with hypocalcemia on the electrocardiogram, or a low measured ionized calcium level), intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> can be administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In patients with advanced liver disease who receive a large volume of salvaged blood, it is helpful to monitor calcium levels to detect hypocalcemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1698434362\"><span class=\"h3\">Processing of blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aspirated blood is collected in a sterile, filtered reservoir until the amount is sufficient for processing (typically 375 to 750 mL).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2977552016\"><span class=\"h4\">Centrifugation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The salvaged blood is then pumped into the centrifuge bowl, where the higher density RBCs are separated and concentrated.

Therefore, it is washed with an isotonic solution, usually normal (0.9 percent) saline. Some centers change to a balanced electrolyte solution (eg, PlasmaLyte-A) after administration of a large volume of normal saline (eg, after approximately 1500 mL of saline is reinfused with 3000 mL of salvaged blood) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,49</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Cell salvage instruments can process a full reservoir of blood in approximately three minutes, resulting in 55 to 225 mL of RBCs with hemoglobin concentration &gt;17 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/16,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,50</a>].

Development of efficient systems for collecting, anticoagulating, and filtering blood for reinfusion has increased interest in salvaging blood after major orthopedic surgery, despite residual concerns regarding the safety of unwashed salvaged blood (see <a href=\"#H16497536\" class=\"local\">'Washed versus unwashed blood'</a> above).

These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulation defects </strong>&ndash; Since intraoperative blood salvage replaces only red blood cells (RBCs), dilutional coagulopathy is a frequent problem accompanying a large blood loss replaced solely by reinfusion of salvaged blood that does not contain plasma or platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage/abstract/66,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,79</a>].

Other standard safety precautions for intravenous infusions are also employed, including removing residual air from the bag containing the red cell product to be infused, avoiding the use of &quot;pressure bags&quot; to increase the reinfusion rate, and using inline air detectors when blood reinfusion is administered via an infusion pump.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Embolism of microaggregates or fat </strong>&ndash; Embolism of microaggregates consisting of white blood cell and platelet debris in salvaged blood is preventable by use of a 40-micron microaggregate filter for reinfusion, which, in addition to RBC washing, is standard practice in blood salvage programs.

The result is a salvaged red blood cell (RBC) product with a hemoglobin &gt;17 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1698434362\" class=\"local\">'Processing of blood'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 40-micron microaggregate filter is installed between the cell salvage bag and the patient to filter the blood as it is reinfused into the patient. A leukocyte depletion filter is an excellent alternative when it is desirable to achieve optimal removal of bacteria, cancer cells, fat particles, or amniotic fluid.
