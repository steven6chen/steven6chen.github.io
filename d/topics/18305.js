The upper digestive tract includes the esophagus (the tube than connects the mouth to the stomach), the stomach, and the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479918017\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor do an upper endoscopy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might have an upper endoscopy if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in your upper belly that you cannot explain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;acid reflux&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting that has lasted a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that has lasted a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Black bowel movements or blood in your vomit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing or a feeling of food getting stuck in your throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal results from other tests of your digestive system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swallowed an object that you should not have swallowed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had growths or ulcers in your digestive tract, and your doctor wants to follow up</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479918024\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do before an upper endoscopy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will give you instructions about what to do before an upper endoscopy. He or she will tell you if you need to stop eating or drinking, or stop taking any of your usual medicines beforehand. Make sure to read the instructions as soon as you get them. You might have to stop some medicines up to a week before the test. Let your doctor know if you have trouble getting ready for your upper endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479918031\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during an upper endoscopy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will give you an IV, a thin tube that goes into a vein. You will get medicines through the IV to make you feel relaxed. He or she might give you a mouth spray or gargle to numb your mouth. You will also get a plastic mouth guard to protect your teeth.</p><p>Then your doctor will put a thin tube with a camera and light on the end into your mouth and down into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. He or she will look for irritation, bleeding, ulcers, or growths.</p><p>During an upper endoscopy, your doctor might also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do a test called a biopsy &ndash; During a biopsy, a doctor takes a small piece of tissue from the lining of the digestive tract. (You will not feel this.) Then he or she looks at the tissue under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat problems that he or she sees &ndash; For example, a doctor can stop bleeding or sometimes remove a growth. He or she can also widen any narrow areas of the esophagus. Narrow areas of the esophagus can cause trouble swallowing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479918038\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after an upper endoscopy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an upper endoscopy, you will be watched for 1 to 2 hours until the medicines wear off. Most doctors recommend that people not drive or go to work right after an upper endoscopy. Most can drive and go back to work the next day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479918045\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of an upper endoscopy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effect is feeling bloated. Some people have nausea because of the medicines used before the procedure. If this happens to you, your doctor can give you medicine to make the nausea better. Most people can eat as usual after the procedure.</p><p>Other side effects are not as common, but can occur. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food from the stomach getting into the lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding, for example, after a growth is removed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting a tear in the digestive tract lining</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having redness or swelling of the skin around the IV</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479918052\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following problems after your upper endoscopy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain that is much worse than gas pain or cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bloated and hard belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing or severe throat pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Black bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;crunching&quot; feeling under the skin in the neck</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479918059\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peptic ulcers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=h-pylori-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: H. pylori infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Barrett's esophagus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiatal-hernia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hiatal hernia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Achalasia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
