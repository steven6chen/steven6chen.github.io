It is the most frequent form of intellectual disability caused by a microscopically demonstrable chromosomal aberration. </p><p>The syndrome manifests as developmental delay and a spectrum of congenital malformations that may include the heart (eg, atrioventricular septal defect), gastrointestinal tract (eg, duodenal stenosis or atresia, imperforate anus, Hirschsprung disease), musculoskeletal system, and other organs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hematologic abnormalities affecting red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are common in DS, particularly during childhood. Population-based studies show that risk for leukemia is 10 to 20 times higher in individuals with DS compared with the overall population, with a particularly striking increase of the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in young children with DS (approximately 150-fold). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Hematologic disorders'</a>.) </p><p>In addition, children with DS frequently develop a transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) during the newborn period and early infancy (also termed transient leukemia and transient abnormal myelopoiesis). This pre-leukemic disorder poses diagnostic challenges, requires a differentiated approach to management, and plays an important pathogenetic role in the development of AML in children with DS.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of TMD of DS will be presented here. The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and general management of children with DS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119140297\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding the incidence of TMD of DS vary depending on the screening practices and diagnostic criteria used. Reported incidence rates among infants with DS range from 10 to 30 percent. (See <a href=\"#H119140333\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>When the diagnosis is based on morphologic review of the peripheral blood smear for the presence of blasts in suspected cases, TMD has been reported in approximately 10 percent of infants (&lt;90 days old) with DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since TMD cases may go undetected if a blood smear is not obtained at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the actual incidence is likely to be higher. As an example, one prospective study identified circulating blasts (1 to 77 percent blasts) in 98 percent of neonates with DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Using the detection of &gt;5 percent myeloid blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate within the first six months of life as criteria, a TMD incidence of 10 percent was reported in a trial by the Berlin-Frankfurt-M&uuml;nster (BFM) study group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Incidence rates of 25 and 31 percent were reported when the presence of non-erythroid blasts in the peripheral blood was defined by central pathology review in studies by the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and its successor, the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group (COG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>When the diagnostic approach included sequencing to detect somatic <em>GATA1</em> mutations in peripheral blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], overt or clinically silent TMD was found in 29 percent of newborns with DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H119140303\" class=\"local\">'Disease mechanism'</a> below.)</p><p>TMD may also be diagnosed in newborns who lack the clinical features of DS but show mosaicism for trisomy 21 (7 to 16 percent of all the TMD cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/2,4,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,6,8</a>], trisomy 21 confined to TMD blasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], and rarely in infants in whom neither trisomy 21 nor a <em>GATA1 </em>mutation is detectable with available methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119140303\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE MECHANISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The molecular pathogenesis of TMD is a complex, multistep process leading to the transient presence of blasts of megakaryocytic lineage in the peripheral blood of infants with trisomy 21. While some steps in this pathway have been elucidated, many remain unknown.</p><p>TMD arises during fetal development and hematopoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. In the setting of trisomy 21, megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) are expanded during hematopoiesis in the fetal liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/4,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,15</a>]. Development of TMD appears to require the acquisition of a somatic mutation of the gene coding for the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101461\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101461 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p><em>GATA1 </em>mutations in TMD result in the expression of an amino-terminally truncated GATA1 protein (GATA1s). The functional consequence is impaired megakaryocytic differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation of a population of TMD blasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The population of TMD blasts in an individual patient typically harbors a single predominant clone-specific <em>GATA1 </em>mutation, but oligoclonal TMD has been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The number of TMD blasts is often higher in the peripheral blood than in the bone marrow (the site of postnatal hematopoiesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], a finding that is consistent with the origin of TMD in tissues of fetal hematopoiesis (eg, the fetal liver). Organ fibrosis (eg, liver fibrosis) is present in a minority of patients and may be associated with the secretion of fibrogenic cytokines such as PDGF alpha and beta, TGF beta in TMD blasts, and expression of PDGFR beta or MCP-1 in fibrotic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>TMD resolves in the vast majority of patients within the first three months of life. In approximately 20 percent of cases of TMD, however, the apparent clinical resolution of TMD is followed by the onset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), typically within the first four years of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101461\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101461 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H119140345\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and course'</a> below.) </p><p>The clone-specific <em>GATA1</em> mutation in TMD and AML blasts is concordant within the same individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24</a>], consistent with a disease model in which AML develops from a subclone of TMD as a pre-leukemic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The mechanisms underlying the spontaneous resolution of TMD are unknown. Hypotheses include the developmental transition from prenatal fetal liver to postnatal bone marrow hematopoiesis, a response by the developing immune system, and a high rate of spontaneous apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Initial studies have suggested mechanisms underlying the progression of TMD to AML. Comparisons of TMD blasts and those of subsequent AML from the same individuals have shown that AML blasts contain mutations of cohesin complex, signal transducer, and epigenetic modifier genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and mutations affecting WNT, JAK-STAT, or <span class=\"nowrap\">MAPK/PI3K</span> signaling pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] in addition to <em>GATA1</em> mutations. These findings are consistent with a model in which TMD blasts are generally programmed to disappear after birth and may persist subclinically for up to four years, during which time approximately 20 percent of patients will acquire additional mutations that result in the transformation of TMD to AML. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119140309\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1389520837\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectrum of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spectrum of clinical presentations of TMD ranges from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Most patients are diagnosed within the first weeks of life. Some first come to clinical attention when circulating blasts are noted on a peripheral smear performed for screening purposes. Others are overtly ill with a wide range of physical and laboratory abnormalities at the time of diagnosis. &#160;</p><p>The frequency and range of symptoms depend at least partially upon the method of detection and definition of disease. Among the 48 infants with TMD registered in the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) 9481 study, 25 percent were asymptomatic and solely diagnosed based on abnormal blood counts or blasts in peripheral blood smear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Within the symptomatic population, the most common sign attributable to TMD was hepatosplenomegaly (56 percent). In a separate clinical trial by the Berlin-Frankfurt-M&uuml;nster (BFM) study group of 146 newborns with TMD, only 10 percent of patients did not have clinical signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the A2971 study by the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group (COG), 38 percent of the infants with TMD were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Among all patients with TMD, 22 to 28 percent present with life-threatening symptoms due to hydrops fetalis, hyperleukocytosis, liver failure, and cardiopulmonary failure, which may be associated with pericardial and pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/4-6,13,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,13,29</a>].</p><p>In addition to the signs and symptoms attributable to TMD, these infants commonly display other features associated with trisomy 21, which are described in more detail separately.

Hepatomegaly (60 percent) and splenomegaly (42 percent) are commonly present at diagnosis of TMD, while pleural or pericardial effusions (23 percent) and ascites (12 percent) are less frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Lymphadenopathy is infrequent in TMD (2 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Hepatic infiltration can be severe and associated with liver failure and liver fibrosis in 7 to 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Liver fibrosis is a highly unfavorable prognostic sign and may occur in newborns with a low number of circulating blasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one trial, none of the patients with documented liver fibrosis survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>At times, skin lesions consisting of papules, vesicles, and pustules may be the first sign pointing to TMD in a newborn with DS or trisomy 21 mosaicism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Depending on the sensitivity of the test used, it may be helpful to exclude TMD in patients with low blast counts and thus help determine which infants with blasts in the peripheral blood may not require follow-up during the first four years of life to rule out the onset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

In addition, <em>GATA1</em> mutation testing by sequencing may be pursued, if available.</p><p>As a disorder of fetal liver hematopoiesis, TMD has the particular characteristic of increased blasts in the peripheral blood with minor bone marrow infiltration.

Karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosome 21 of an unstimulated and PHA-stimulated peripheral blood sample (the latter to evaluate trisomy 21 status of peripheral blood T lymphocytes), buccal smear, and request of a genetic consultation are recommended because parents in this situation suddenly experience a shift of their concerns from blood cell abnormalities to the implications of trisomy 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-myeloproliferative-disorder-of-down-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63583982\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic criteria for TMD are not universal.

TMD arises during fetal development and hematopoiesis in the setting of trisomy 21 (constitutional trisomy, trisomy mosaicism, or somatic trisomy in the blast population) and the acquisition of a somatic mutation in the gene coding for the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. (See <a href=\"#H119140297\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H119140303\" class=\"local\">'Disease mechanism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients are diagnosed within the first weeks of life. Some are asymptomatic and first come to clinical attention when circulating blasts are noted on a peripheral smear performed for screening purposes. Others are overtly ill with potentially life-threatening symptoms due to hydrops fetalis, hyperleukocytosis, liver failure, and cardiopulmonary failure, which may be associated with pericardial and pleural effusions. (See <a href=\"#H119140309\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMD is characterized by the presence of blasts (usually megakaryoblasts) in the peripheral blood and a relatively minor marrow infiltration. Moderate leukocytosis is common and a small proportion of children present with hyperleukocytosis. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are usually mild. Conjugated bilirubin is frequently elevated and a minority will have evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. (See <a href=\"#H119140315\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of TMD is usually suspected in newborns with DS found to have blasts on the peripheral smear and abnormal blood counts on screening. Such cases should undergo further evaluation with flow cytometry to determine the immunophenotype of the blasts and cytogenetic analysis of the peripheral blood blasts to confirm trisomy 21. In addition, <em>GATA1</em> mutation testing by sequencing may be pursued, if available. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is not routinely necessary for the diagnosis of TMD. (See <a href=\"#H63583975\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of suspected cases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMD should be considered in the evaluation of neonates with DS who, in addition to blasts in the peripheral blood, present with hyperleukocytosis, hydrops fetalis, ascites, liver failure, coagulopathy, or unexplained pericardial and pleural effusions. Detection of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with TMD in an infant who lacks the features of DS should prompt the evaluation of trisomy 21 mosaicism. (See <a href=\"#H63583975\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of suspected cases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic criteria for TMD are not universal. In most cases, the diagnosis is made based on the identification of blasts in the peripheral blood with a <span class=\"nowrap\">megakaryoblastic/megakaryocytic</span> immunophenotype on flow cytometry. Although not widely available, the most definitive test to identify TMD blasts is detection of a somatic mutation of <em>GATA1</em>, typically in exon 2 or 3. (See <a href=\"#H63583982\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with TMD will not require therapy directed at the malignant clone. This is primarily because TMD resolves spontaneously in the vast majority of patients and because treatment with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cytarabine</a> does not appear to decrease the probability of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment with low-dose cytarabine is offered to patients with risk factors for early death. Low-dose cytarabine has demonstrated a survival benefit in this population. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While different risk stratification models have been used, we suggest the use of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cytarabine</a> to patients with one or more of the following risk factors for early death from TMD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H63584148\" class=\"local\">'Indications for therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hyperleukocytosis (white blood count [WBC] &gt;100 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Liver failure or life-threatening hepatic dysfunction (ascites, hyperbilirubinemia &gt;10 times the upper limit of normal, AST or ALT &gt;20 times the upper limit of normal)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hydrops fetalis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pericardial effusion, pleural effusions not secondary to cardiac failure </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bleeding diathesis, disseminated intravascular coagulation &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not offer low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cytarabine</a> to other patients, including those who have hepatomegaly (not explained by cardiac cause) without hepatic dysfunction. Such patients have a low risk of early death without therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 20 percent of the patients with TMD go on to develop AML within the first four years of life. While empiric, we follow every child with history of TMD, whether treated or not, with a physical exam, complete and differential blood count, and blood smear every three months up to the age of four years. Unlike AML in other children, AML that develops in children with DS has an excellent prognosis.
