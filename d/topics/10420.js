In addition, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) commonly occur in the pulmonary, hepatic, and cerebral circulations, demanding knowledge of the risks and benefits of screening and treatment of patients with these complications.</p><p>The management of HHT will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, epidemiology, and diagnosis of HHT are discussed in detail separately.</p><p>Additional discussions of pulmonary AVMs, which affect over half of individuals with HHT, are also discussed separately.

These may be sacs (eg, for pulmonary AVMs), small collections of intervening vessels (nidal AVMs), or direct high-flow connections between the arterial and venous side (arteriovenous fistulas [AVFs]). AVMs result in arteriovenous shunting. Shunting may also be observed secondary to dilatation of existing normal capillaries (eg, in the hepatopulmonary syndrome) and potentially as part of normal physiological responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Telangiectasia</strong> &ndash; A telangiectasia is a small, dilated blood vessel (arteriole, venule, or capillary). The term is descriptive and refers to telangiectasia of many anatomical types and etiologies. HHT telangiectasia usually contain small arteriovenous communications, and are commonly located near the surface of skin or mucous membranes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aneurysm</strong> &ndash; An aneurysm is a focal dilatation (ballooning) of an artery and represents a potentially unstable structure.</p><p/><p>These lesions are not specific for HHT; they can also be seen sporadically in otherwise healthy individuals, associated with other disorders, or as part of a syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058197281\"><span class=\"h2\">Epistaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epistaxis is the most common site of blood loss in HHT, affecting more than 90 percent of patients. Very high proportions experience epistaxis on a daily or near-daily basis, and the iron losses are sufficient to cause iron deficiency anemia, even in the absence of additional gastrointestinal bleeding. Management of epistaxis and iron deficiency anemia are therefore cornerstones of HHT management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia-osler-weber-rendu-syndrome#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Epistaxis'</a>.)</p><p>A number of topical, systemic, and surgical treatments are available for preventing and managing epistaxis. Responses vary in different individuals, and it is not possible to predict who will respond particularly well to a given intervention.</p><p>Epistaxis is the usual cause of iron deficiency anemia in HHT, and attention to appropriate monitoring and treatment is required. (See <a href=\"#H514425074\" class=\"local\">'Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3943390986\"><span class=\"h3\">Local therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is accumulating evidence to encourage the use of local preventive therapies (eg, nasal humidification, ointments, saline spray). These therapies are essentially free of significant adverse effects, although occasional individuals report that they seem to precipitate their nosebleeds, in which case they should be discontinued.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saline nasal sprays can be used to prevent drying, especially during winter and in dry environments (see <a href=\"#H41878615\" class=\"local\">'Airline travel'</a> below). Saline nasal sprays demonstrated significant benefits in two trials in which they were used as placebo:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a trial from 2016 involving 80 patients with HHT randomly assigned to receive intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> or a saline nasal spray, the epistaxis severity score (ESS) in the 27 patients receiving nasal saline was reduced from 5.7 (95% CI 5.0-6.3) to 3.7 (95% CI 3.2-4.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Other studies have demonstrated that the minimally important difference in the ESS is 0.7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In the trial, no greater benefit was observed with topical application of bevacizumab, estriol, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>, although the study was under-powered to rule out any difference.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a second trial from 2016 involving 121 patients with HHT who were randomly assigned to receive one of several nasal sprays (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, estriol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>, or saline [placebo]), the 0.9% saline placebo spray reduced the median duration of epistaxis (in minutes per month) from 212 (95% CI 20-874) to 149 (95% CI 1-660) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. No greater benefit (or trend to greater benefit) was observed in topical application of bevacizumab at varying dosages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Additionally, in a survey of 649 patients with HHT and epistaxis, there were positive (beneficial) scores for improvement of epistaxis with saline treatments (1.50 [95% CI 1.23-1.78]), room humidification (1.50 [95% CI 1.31-1.69]), and nasal lubrication (0.61 [95% CI 0.15-1.08]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHT nosebleeds usually come in clusters, and vary in severity over a lifetime. A proportion of people with HHT (we estimate approximately 1 in 3), may be able to identify dietary triggers of nosebleeds that can be avoided without detrimentally impacting their lifestyle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/3,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,18</a>]. We suggest keeping a food diary of items ingested prior to an unusually severe bleed, to aid identification of potential precipitants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caution with over-the-counter dietary supplements offers another opportunity to avoid potential precipitants. An example is fish oil supplements, for which antiplatelet activity is not generally appreciated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> has been developed, due to evidence of efficacy from systemic therapy (see below) but concerns about the potential for systemic adverse effects, particularly venous thromboembolism. This is under evaluation in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2016 randomized trial found that a 0.1% estriol ointment applied to the nasal mucosa was no better than placebo in treating epistaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>For patients who continue to experience significant nosebleeds, review by an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeon with expertise in this area is advisable to optimize interventional treatments. Dedicated local ENT treatments are generally directed to patients experiencing very frequent epistaxis, or less frequent massive hemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In one survey, 326 of 666 unselected respondents with HHT (49 percent) had required specialist invasive treatments, often requiring multi-modality therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different types of laser or argon plasma coagulation devices are available, with the choice of method depending on operator preference and availability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser therapy is generally preferred over cauterization, since cauterization can damage the nasal mucosa, which may prompt vascular regrowth, but if cauterization is the only therapy available, it can have beneficial effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In an unbiased survey comparing 267 international HHT users of cauterization and 221 users of laser therapy, laser therapy was reported to be beneficial more frequently than cauterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other directed therapies include, laser ablation, septodermoplasty, and unilateral or bilateral surgical closure of the nostrils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/3,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22-26</a>]. These invasive treatments are almost always used in patients who have also received laser therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cauterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>]. Young&rsquo;s procedure (bilateral surgical closure of the nostrils) has not been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, but in our experience it demonstrates remarkable long-term success in alleviating major nosebleeds and reversing transfusion dependency, as long as there is complete closure of nasal flow. However, a small proportion of patients cannot tolerate the procedure and request reversal, and a larger number decline when offered, concerned about the implication of anosmia and mouth breathing. Some patients have been treated with submucosal injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> at the time of laser therapy; long-term results of this approach are awaited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p>Emergency nasal packing may be required for severe hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-epistaxis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with epistaxis&quot;, section on 'Nasal packing'</a>.)</p><p>Additional information about local therapies for the management of epistaxis is presented separately.

The decision to use systemic therapy and the choice of systemic agent depends on risk-benefit evaluations and is individualized to incorporate potential benefits and risks for the specific patient, as discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H1195200695\" class=\"local\">'Systemic agents to manage bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>All of the known systemic agents demonstrated to have efficacy in treating HHT nosebleeds also increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In our institution, we therefore avoid these agents in patients with a prior history of VTE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those at particularly high risk of cerebral sequelae (eg, due to concurrent atrial fibrillation). In our HHT practice, where venous and arterial thromboemboli are common long-term complications that lead to a requirement for full anticoagulation with its attendant risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>], we advise these patients to seek topical therapy if required. Concerns about VTE with systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> have led to the development of investigational topical tranexamic acid. (See <a href=\"#H3943390986\" class=\"local\">'Local therapies'</a> above.)</p><p>When we do choose systemic therapy, the first choice is generally between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> &ndash; In a 2009 trial that randomly assigned 25 individuals with HHT (men and women) to receive placebo or tamoxifen (20 mg once daily) for six months, tamoxifen was associated with a reduction in epistaxis, based on self-report and nasal endoscopy (improvement in 18 versus 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Some individuals assigned to tamoxifen also had an improvement in hemoglobin level or reduction in transfusion requirements. Extended follow-up studies (mean 23.4 months of treatment) suggested sustained benefits from tamoxifen, which was well-tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This has been our experience; in contrast to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>, we have yet to see VTE developing in HHT patients using tamoxifen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/29,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,34</a>], and we are concerned that several ischemic strokes occurred in patients with HHT and PAVMs using tranexamic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>]. Tamoxifen is therefore our current treatment of choice amongst systemic agents for treating HHT epistaxis, though it is only suggested in selected cases, as indicated above.

As noted separately, the major cause of iron deficiency is bleeding, including bleeding from epistaxis and gastrointestinal AVMs, with insufficient iron supplementation for the degree of bleeding. A survey of 50 individuals with HHT emphasized that epistaxis is usually sufficiently severe to account for the iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The approximate blood loss from epistaxis was in the order of 277 mL per month resulting in hemorrhage-adjusted iron requirements that could <strong>not</strong> be met from dietary sources alone in 80 percent of the study participants. Forty-three patients (86 percent) met their recommended dietary allowance of iron, but only 10 (20 percent) met their hemorrhage-adjusted iron requirement (HAIR).

We also regularly assess iron status, regardless of the hemoglobin level, in order to detect iron deficiency that is likely to progress to anemia if not treated.

On the one hand, cerebral hemorrhages in HHT patients are usually life-changing and may be fatal. On the other hand, many HHT-related cerebral AV shunts will never bleed, and both investigation and treatments carry risks including radiation exposure and complications of interventional treatments. (See <a href=\"#H3647832702\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral lesions'</a> above.)</p><p>In the UK and other countries, risk-benefit considerations for asymptomatic cerebral AVMs usually are not interpreted in favor of treatment because the potential risks of intervention (eg, neurosurgery, endovascular approaches, stereotactic radiotherapy) outweigh the predicted benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Thus, with screening, up to 10 percent of individuals would be faced with the identification of cerebral AVMs for which no treatment or management options would be recommended.

A number of topical, systemic, and surgical treatments are available. As a general rule, we try to use local preventive therapies (eg, nasal humidification, ointments) and other modifications such as dietary changes in order to avoid potential toxicities of systemic therapy; however, management is individualized. Some individuals with bleeding from localized vascular lesions may require subspecialist management, and some may require medical systemic therapies if epistaxis is recurrent or localized interventions are insufficient. Systemic agents should be used with caution if there is a propensity to venous or arterial thromboemboli. (See <a href=\"#H1842268103\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2058197281\" class=\"local\">'Epistaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal lesions in HHT may be accessible for local therapies administered endoscopically.

Iron deficiency anemia is usually due to epistaxis. Most individuals with iron deficiency are treated with oral iron supplements, but parenteral iron therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood transfusions may be required if iron absorption is impaired or bleeding is severe. (See <a href=\"#H514425074\" class=\"local\">'Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are especially concerning because patients can develop a number of potentially life-threatening cerebral complications including ischemic stroke caused by a paradoxical embolus to the brain, brain abscess caused by a paradoxical septic embolus, hypoxia, or rupture with hemoptysis or hemothorax. We initiate routine screening for PAVMs after the age of 16 years. For PAVMs of a size amenable to embolization, embolotherapy is recommended, similar to individuals without HHT, unless there are complications such as significant pulmonary hypertension that require more individualized therapy. Other interventions for individuals with PAVMs are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H2324314219\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary AVMs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H763345465\" class=\"local\">'PAVM screening'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic approach to adult patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic AVMs are almost always asymptomatic. In our experience, a major risk is of misdiagnoses as metastases and clinician education is required. In less than 10 percent of patients, symptoms may develop, attributable to portal hypertension, biliary disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high output heart failure. For individuals with symptomatic liver involvement, treatment is generally supportive and directed at optimizing cardiac status and iron stores. If medical management fails, liver transplantation is the treatment of choice. The angiogenesis inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> may also be helpful, but data are too preliminary to support routine use in this setting.

Management should be performed by clinicians with expertise in this area. Screening of asymptomatic patients for cerebral AV shunts also remains controversial, especially in children. (See <a href=\"#H3647832702\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2563903851\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral AV shunt screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening to diagnose arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in individuals at risk of HHT, or those with HHT but without symptoms relevant to the AVMs, is distinct from investigation of a symptomatic patient. In general, assuming the individual is in agreement, screening consists of a basic clinical examination, evaluation for anemia and iron deficiency, and PAVM screening. Screening for AVMs at other sites is individualized. In addition to taking into account the risk-benefit ratio of detecting asymptomatic lesions, clinicians should be cognizant of the significant radiation exposure that can occur during a lifetime of imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H2557811534\" class=\"local\">'Screening (asymptomatic individuals)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional management recommendations apply to children, pregnant women, HHT associated with a pathogenic <em>SMAD4</em> variant, individuals with HHT who develop a venous thromboembolism or ischemic stroke, and airline travel, as discussed above.
