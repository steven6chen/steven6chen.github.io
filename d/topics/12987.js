Data on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is often based upon the following classification of preterm infants who are categorized by their birth weight or GA as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low birth weight (LBW) &ndash; BW less than 2500 g</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very low birth weight (VLBW) &ndash; BW less than 1500 g</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) &ndash; BW less than 1000 g</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremely preterm (EPT) &ndash; GA less than 28 weeks</p><p/><p>These terms are used throughout this discussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has continued to evolve since 1967 when Northway first described the disorder, which resulted from effects of oxygen and mechanical ventilation in premature infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is due to changes in the population at risk (ie, more survivors at earlier gestational ages) and improved neonatal management (ie, surfactant, antenatal glucocorticoid therapy, and less aggressive mechanical ventilation) that have altered the pathology and clinical course of BPD. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>Earlier definitions based upon oxygen requirement either at 28 postnatal days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] or 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) do not account for extreme prematurity (ie, birth weight &lt;1000 g or gestational age &lt;30 weeks) and the severity of respiratory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. These definitions became less accurate in predicting outcome because of the increasing survival rate of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, and the increased prevalence of milder forms of BPD due to improved treatment of RDS. As an example, oxygen supplementation at 28 days of age in ELBW infants may be due to lung immaturity and not BPD. Whereas, an ELBW infant with mild BPD disease who required oxygen within the first 28 days of age, but not at 36 weeks PMA, would not be diagnosed as having BPD using the latter definition. The failure to include gestational age at birth or disease severity led to concerns that these definitions are inadequate, especially when comparing the efficacy of different therapeutic interventions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> long-term outcome of ELBW infants with BPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">NICHD criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2001, a consensus conference of the United States National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) modified the preexisting definitions of oxygen requirement by adding criteria that included gestational age (GA) and severity of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64789 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The timing of assessment is based upon GA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are &lt;32 weeks GA are assessed at 36 weeks PMA or when discharged home, whichever comes first.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are &ge;32 weeks GA are assessed between 29 to 55 days of age or when discharged home, whichever comes first.</p><p/><p>Infants who require supplemental oxygen for at least 28 postnatal days are classified as having mild, moderate, or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), depending upon the extent of oxygen supplementation and other respiratory support. To standardize the use of supplemental oxygen, the NICHD criteria also proposed that the need for oxygen be confirmed by using a physiologic test, although a specific test was not defined.</p><p>A study from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network reported that the NICHD criteria more accurately predicted pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months corrected age in preterm infants &lt;32 weeks GA with BPD than previous definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In particular, the definition of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA would have missed a substantial number of patients with mild BPD who may be at risk for pulmonary and neurodevelopmental complications. NICHD criteria more accurately predicted which preterm survivors would require pulmonary medication and rehospitalization for pulmonary disease. The incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment (ie, lower mental and psychomotor developmental index scores, cerebral palsy, blindness, hearing impairment) increased with the severity of disease based upon the NICHD criteria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Physiologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, the NICHD criteria also proposed that the requirement of supplemental oxygen be confirmed by using a physiologic test, although a specific test was not defined. Adoption of a BPD definition based upon physiologic testing would reduce the effect of clinical practice differences when comparing outcome among centers caring for these patients.</p><p>One prospective multicenter study compared a physiologic test based upon oxygen administration and saturation with the standard clinical definition of oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks PMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The physiologic definition lowered the rate of BPD from 35 percent based upon the clinical definition to 25 percent, and reduced the variation in incidence among centers. However, in an NICHD study of outcomes among 9575 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, use of the severity-based definition classified more infants as having BPD (new definition, 68 percent; traditional definition, 42 percent; and physiologic definition, 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] These results demonstrate the importance of a standardized definition of BPD to compare outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40099275\"><span class=\"h3\">Higher altitudes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in altitude may impact the utility of the NICHD consensus definition because arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen saturation are lower at high altitudes, which makes it more difficult to compare rates of BPD using the NICHD criteria between centers at high altitude and those at sea level. However, correcting for barometric pressure, or using a standard physiologic definition for oxygen need and adjustment for effect of altitude allows for a more accurate comparison of BPD rates among centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This was illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter study using the NICHD criteria, correcting for barometric pressure reduced the initial higher incidence of BPD in centers at higher altitudes compared with those at sea level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-center study conducted at 5280 feet, most VLBW infants, even if otherwise healthy, required supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age to maintain target oxygen saturation of 85 to 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, adjusting for the local altitude showed that a fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>) of 0.25 at 5280 feet was equivalent to room air. BPD rates based on the NICHD criteria before and after altitude adjustment were 72 and 27 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5685389\"><span class=\"h2\">Evolving definitions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the NICHD definitions based on the need for supplemental oxygen at specific time points may be useful in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), they do not predict longer term respiratory outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, support for affected infants may include respiratory support without supplemental oxygen, so that oxygen-based definitions may be inappropriate. Future evolving definitions will likely include biomarkers in addition to clinical criteria, which hopefully will more accurately predict long-term outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) varies among institutions, which may reflect neonatal risk factors, care practices (eg, target levels for acceptable oxygen saturation), and differences in the clinical definitions of BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>Infants with birth weight (BW) &lt;1250 g account for 97 percent of the cases of BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The incidence of BPD increases with decreasing gestational age, as illustrated in a report from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network. In this multicenter study of 9575 infants born between 2003 and 2007 with gestational ages of 22 to 28 weeks and birthweights of 401 to 1500 g, the overall incidence of BPD defined as requiring supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA was 42 percent (range among centers 20 to 89 percent); the incidence using the physiologic definition was 40 percent (range 15 to 82 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'NICHD criteria'</a> above.)</p><p>In this cohort, incidences for each gestational week with ranges among centers using the traditional definition of oxygen supplementation were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>22 weeks: 85 (0 to 100) percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>23 weeks: 73 (35 to 100) percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>24 weeks: 69 (31 to 100) percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>25 weeks: 55 (20 to100) percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>26 weeks: 44 (19 to 100) percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>27 weeks: 34 (13 to 76) percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>28 weeks: 23 (9 to 88) percent</p><p/><p>It is unclear whether or not the incidence of BPD is changing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the above study from the NICHD neonatal network, the incidence of BPD did not change over the five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the number of infants with severe BPD (ie, receiving ventilatory support) decreased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective multicenter Canadian study, there was a decrease in mortality between infants born between 1996 to 1997 and 2006 to 2007, but a corresponding increase in the incidence of BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, a study using a United States national database (Nationwide Inpatient Sample) reported a decrease in the rate of BPD of 4.3 percent per year for the study period between 1993 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, increases in the costs and length of hospitalizations for infants with BPD were also seen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In surfactant-treated extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, the characteristic pathologic finding of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is disruption of lung development, referred to as the &quot;new&quot; BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/6,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,21</a>]. In these patients, decreased septation and alveolar hypoplasia lead to fewer and larger alveoli with a reduction in the surface area available for gas exchange. There is also dysregulation of pulmonary vasculature development (eg, abnormal distribution of alveolar capillaries, and thickening of the muscle layer of the pulmonary arterioles that results in an increase in pulmonary resistance). In comparison with &quot;old&quot; BPD, there is a reduction of airway injury and inflammation is less prominent. These findings are most prominent in the smallest, most immature infants.</p><p>Early disruption of vasculogenesis can lead to pulmonary vascular disease in BPD, resulting in pulmonary hypertension and contributing to morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The underlying mechanisms that contribute to impaired vasculogenesis are a subject of ongoing research.</p><p>These findings are in contrast to &quot;old&quot; BPD seen in infants prior to the availability of surfactant replacement therapy before the 1980s. The prominent pathologic findings in &quot;old&quot; BPD were airway injury, inflammation, and parenchymal fibrosis due to mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69557 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>]. Similar changes may be seen in certain surfactant-treated infants who develop severe BPD. In these severely affected infants, fibrosis, bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy, and interstitial edema (&quot;old&quot; BPD) may be superimposed on the characteristic reduced numbers of alveoli and capillaries (&quot;new&quot; BPD). Pulmonary vascular changes, such as abnormal arterial muscularization and obliteration of vessels, may also occur.</p><p>Lung injury also is associated with increased elastic tissue formation and thickening of the interstitium. These tissue deformations may, in turn, compromise septation and capillary development. In one autopsy study, the amount of elastic tissue, septal thickness, and alveolar and duct diameters increased with the severity of BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is multifactorial and involves exposure to antenatal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postnatal factors (eg, mechanical ventilation, oxygen toxicity, and infection), which disrupt pulmonary development, and may cause inflammation and damage to the highly vulnerable premature lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69557 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The following studies illustrate the effect of these factors upon the risk of developing BPD.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective report from the ELGAN (Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns) study, predictive factors for BPD included lower gestational age in this already extreme prematurity cohort, FiO<sub>2</sub> requirement greater than 0.25 at 14 days of age, and mechanical ventilation at one week of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 1244 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in North Carolina, significant risk factors for BPD were the need for ventilation at 48 hours of age (odds ratio [OR] 1.64), nosocomial infection (OR 2.0), and increased fluid intake on day two (OR 1.06 per 10 mL increase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Risk factors for BPD included low birth weight (OR 2.9 per 100 g decrement), PDA (OR 6.2), and sepsis (OR 4.4).</p><p/><p>Individual risk factors are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prematurity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lung appears to be most susceptible to damage during the saccular stage of development from 23 to 32 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27</a>]. At this stage, the premature lung has poorly developed airway supporting structures, surfactant deficiency, decreased compliance, underdeveloped antioxidant mechanisms, and inadequate fluid clearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69557 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/20,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,28</a>]. The premature lung's structural and functional immaturity increases the risk of injury and disruption of normal pulmonary microvascular and alveolar development from external antenatal and postnatal insults.</p><p>In addition, fetal growth restriction in premature infants (gestational age below 28 weeks) appears to be an independent risk factor for BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In a case-control study that included 2255 infants less than 33 weeks gestation, infants born small for gestational had more than twice the risk of BPD (OR 2.73, 95% CI 2.11-3.55) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Because of the evidence that aggressive mechanical ventilation played a major role in the pathogenesis of BPD, increased use of noninvasive support and a more conservative approach towards mechanical ventilation (ie, avoidance of high tidal volume) has evolved. This approach is one of the factors that have resulted in a milder form of BPD (&quot;new&quot; BPD). As a result, significant airway injury characteristic of the old BPD is less common, and is only seen in infants with severe BPD. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation in neonates&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and long-term pulmonary outcomes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute lung injury results from inflations that are close to the maximum lung volume of small immature lungs, and plays a role in the chronic changes resulting in BPD. The risk of BPD increases with decreasing arterial carbon dioxide tension (PCO<sub>2</sub>) as a measure of more aggressive ventilation that includes large tidal volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,34,35</a>].</p><p>Positive pressure ventilation typically induces bronchiolar lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Disruption of airways may occur early in the course of treatment and may be manifested by increased pulmonary resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In one study of ventilated preterm infants in the first five days after birth, mean pulmonary resistance was significantly greater in those who subsequently developed BPD compared with those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In premature baboons treated with exogenous surfactant, prolonged intubation and low tidal volume ventilation for five days compared with one day intubation and weaning to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) resulted in poorer lung mechanics and respiratory function (eg, lower arterial to alveolar oxygen ratio, higher PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and poorer respiratory drive), increased histopathologic findings of cellular bronchiolitis and peribronchiolar alveolar wall thickening, and increased lavage levels of cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Another animal study has shown that even a small number of large inflations soon after birth can adversely affect surfactant-deficient lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In this study of newborn lambs, one lamb of each of five pairs was randomly assigned to receive six large manual inflations (&quot;bagging&quot;) after preterm delivery, and before starting mechanical ventilation and receiving artificial surfactant.

The presence of these mediators is associated with complement activation, increased vascular permeability, protein leakage, and mobilization of neutrophils into the interstitial and alveolar compartments.

In these samples, surfactant proteins A, B, and C were reduced by 50, 80, and 72 percent, respectively. In addition, there appears to be a temporal association between samples with low surface tension, and episodes of infection and respiratory deterioration. These results suggest that premature infants who require continued respiratory support have transient surfactant dysfunction or deficiency, which may affect their clinical status.</p><p>However, it appears that late administration of surfactant does not reduce the risk of BPD.
