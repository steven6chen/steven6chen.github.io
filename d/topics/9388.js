These virulence factors are also associated with primary liver abscess, and their higher frequency in community-acquired isolates could explain why isolates from primary liver abscess are almost exclusively acquired in the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae/abstract/1-3,6,11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6,11,25</a>].

In a review of 455 consecutive cases of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> bacteremia in seven countries (Taiwan, South Africa, United States, Australia, Belgium, Turkey, and Argentina), the invasive community-acquired syndrome of liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis was only seen in Taiwan and South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The isolates from Taiwan and South Africa compared with the other countries were much more likely to have a mucoid phenotype (100 versus 2 percent) and to be rmpA-positive (86 versus 7 percent). Other virulence factors, such as K1 capsular serotype, were common in Taiwan and South Africa but rarely seen in the other countries. </p><p>The role of virulence factors in KLA is discussed in further detail separately.

Virulence factors of the isolate have been more clearly associated with the development of metastatic disease.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyogenic-liver-abscess#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyogenic liver abscess&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) are the imaging methods of choice when liver abscess is part of the differential diagnosis in patients with the above clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61510\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61510 \">image 1</a>). Imaging for liver abscess may also be warranted in patients who present with <em>K. pneumoniae</em> bacteremia and have persistent fever despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Some radiographic findings have been associated with KLA compared with liver abscesses due to other pathogens, but these findings alone are not diagnostic of KLA. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Following radiologic identification of a possible liver abscess, image-guided diagnostic aspiration should be performed to confirm a pyogenic process. Specimens should be sent for Gram stain and both aerobic and anaerobic culture. Blood cultures should be obtained from all patients with known or suspected liver abscess since KLA may be associated with bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae/abstract/10,11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1778351\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain includes other hepatobiliary disease, colitis, or pneumonia. This topic is reviewed in detail separately. </p><p>The differential diagnosis of patients presenting with a focal liver lesion is broad and includes both malignant and infectious etiologies. Imaging studies (ultrasound or computed tomography [CT]) can usually differentiate abscess from malignancy. In some instances, however, a multilobulated abscess may mimic the heterogeneity of hepatic tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83712\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83712 \">image 2</a>). Conversely, necrosis of hepatic tumor can appear similar to a highly suppurative abscess on CT. In these diagnostic difficulties, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to differentiate between hepatic abscess and necrotic liver tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. However, it is possible that <em>K. pneumoniae</em> could be isolated from an infected and necrotic hepatic tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].

Percutaneous drainage for treatment is recommended even in patients in whom the diagnosis has been made on the basis of positive blood cultures. </p><p>In some cases, the abscess may not be amenable to immediate drainage, for example, if it is still in an immature form. Two options are to postpone drainage and monitor closely until the abscess has matured and can then be drained or to insert the drain and retain the tubing so that the abscess can drain once it becomes liquefied. Surgical resection may be warranted in some instances, such as when the abscess is multiloculated, it fails to liquefy, or there is delayed resolution and a protracted course of fever.

Initial therapy for KLA may be administered as outlined for empiric management of pyogenic liver abscess, which generally should include coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic organisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67894\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67894 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyogenic-liver-abscess#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyogenic liver abscess&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p>Subsequent antibiotic therapy should be tailored to results of antibiotic susceptibility testing. In reports from Taiwan and Korea, antibiotic regimens have included extended spectrum beta-lactams and cephalosporins with or without aminoglycosides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae/abstract/1,3,14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,14,20</a>].</p><p>There is disagreement regarding the selection of early or late generation cephalosporins. Many favor use of first generation cephalosporins (with or without an aminoglycoside) given their relatively low cost and apparent efficacy with respect to rates of mortality, metastatic infection, and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, others have reported higher metastatic infection rates among patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> compared with those treated with a second or third generation cephalosporin, both with or without an aminoglycoside (37 versus 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>In regions where third generation cephalosporins are much more costly than first generation cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> with or without an aminoglycoside may be the favored antibiotic regimen. However, third generation cephalosporins are favorable if costs are not prohibitive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the setting of severe infection.</p><p>Although aminoglycosides penetrate abscess cavities poorly, in theory they may eradicate bloodstream organisms early in the course of infection, potentially decreasing risk for metastatic complications. However, this benefit is unproven and may be outweighed by the toxicity of aminoglycosides.

Longer courses of treatment may be warranted for patients requiring subsequent drainage procedures or with persistent radiographic evidence of abscess. Parenteral antibiotics may be administered for the first two to three weeks until the patient has improved systemically and drainage is complete; the remainder of the course can be completed with oral agents.</p><p>Follow-up imaging should be used to monitor the response to therapy, to determine the duration of antibiotics, and to assess the need for further aspiration. In general, treatment should be continued until CT imaging demonstrates complete or near complete resolution of the abscess cavity. Some abscesses with a thick capsule may leave a CT abnormality remaining after the infection has been eradicated, and other clinical findings, such as normalization of inflammatory markers, sterile cultures, and the finding of a clear cavity without debris or other content on imaging, can be helpful to distinguish this from persistent infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2270704\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of metastatic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to systemic antibiotics, local therapy or debridement may be required in patients with metastatic infection.
