Central hypothyroidism refers to thyroid hormone deficiency due to a disorder of the pituitary, hypothalamus, or hypothalamic-pituitary portal circulation, resulting in diminished thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), or both. Pituitary TSH production is regulated in part by TRH, which is secreted from the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus. TRH is released into portal blood vessels and transported to the anterior pituitary gland where it regulates the synthesis, glycosylation, and release of TSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75399\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75399 \">figure 1</a>). TSH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-synthesis-and-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone synthesis and physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of central hypothyroidism will be reviewed here.

The causes of central hypothyroidism are the same as the causes of hypopituitarism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55951 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Patients with central hypothyroidism frequently have other pituitary hormone deficiencies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pituitary mass lesions, especially pituitary adenomas, are the most common cause of central hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pituitary tumors can cause central hypothyroidism by compressing pituitary thyrotrophs, which results in a decrease in TSH secretion; by interrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary portal blood flow, which results in disruption of the signaling between the hypothalamus and pituitary; or, rarely, by acute hemorrhage or infarction, resulting in pituitary apoplexy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Other mass lesions that can cause central hypothyroidism include cysts and abscesses, meningiomas and dysgerminomas, metastatic tumors, and craniopharyngiomas, which may enter the sella or remain suprasellar.</p><p>In addition, surgery or radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas or other mass lesions can cause central hypothyroidism. Radiation in high doses (&ge;40 Gray) to the brain, orbits, infratemporal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal regions can affect the pituitary gland or hypothalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

One cause of the former is treatment (of patients with lymphoma) with a retinoid X receptor ligand (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bexarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bexarotene</a>) that selectively inhibits TSH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Several rare genetic defects have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central hypothyroidism may occur due to mutations in the TSH-beta subunit gene, the TRH receptor gene, in <em>TBL1X</em> (the gene encoding the subunit of the nuclear receptor co-repressor of the thyroid hormone receptor complex), and in the <em>IGSF-1</em> gene (whose function is uncertain).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central hypothyroidism also occurs with combined pituitary hormone deficiencies due to mutations in multiple genes including pituitary transcription factors such as <em>POU1F1</em> (PIT1).

Common symptoms of central hypothyroidism include fatigue, cold intolerance, muscle cramps, headache, and weight gain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62676 \">table 2</a>). Goiter is not a typical finding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with central hypothyroidism have a history of previous hypothalamic or pituitary disease, cranial irradiation, infiltrating disease, or trauma, with accompanying symptoms of deficiency or excess of other pituitary hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients with coexisting pituitary hormone abnormalities, the symptoms of hypothyroidism may be less obvious. As an example, hot flashes due to hypogonadism may mask the cold intolerance of hypothyroidism. The coexistence of hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency may result in anorexia and weight loss, while hypothyroid, acromegalic patients may complain of sweating. Children may present with growth retardation and delayed sexual maturation, precocious puberty, or dwarfism and cretinism. The presence of polyuria and polydipsia suggests diabetes insipidus and posterior pituitary or hypothalamic involvement (eg, due to a craniopharyngioma).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18020102\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18020410\"><span class=\"h3\">Thyroid function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with central hypothyroidism, serum free T4 is low or low-normal, but serum TSH may be low, normal, or even slightly elevated (up to approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67935\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67935 \">table 3</a>). In a retrospective study of 108 adult patients with central hypothyroidism (childhood onset, n = 26; adult onset, n = 82), initial free T4 results were in the low-normal range in only 18 percent of patients with adult onset (the remainder having levels below normal), compared with 65 percent of patients with childhood-onset central hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In 51 patients, TSH was measured with a sensitive immunoradiometric assay, and the following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>8 percent of patients had low (&lt;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> serum TSH concentrations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>84 percent had normal values</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>8 percent had high (&gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> values</p><p/><p>Normal or high serum TSH concentrations in some patients with central hypothyroidism is due, in part, to the secretion of TSH that has reduced biologic activity but normal immunoactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Reduced bioactivity is due to abnormalities in glycosylation of the TSH subunits, which is under the control of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>There is a diurnal rhythm in TSH secretion, with a surge late in the evening. This appears to be under hypothalamic control and is absent in many patients with central hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Thus, TSH measurements may be normal during the daytime, but the absence of a nocturnal rise in TSH reduces the overall quantity of TSH secreted by the pituitary gland, causing clinical hypothyroidism.</p><p>In patients with central hypothyroidism, serum total and free T3 levels may be normal or low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18020236\"><span class=\"h3\">TRH stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not currently available in the United States, it is widely available in other countries. A TRH stimulation test involves the intravenous administration of TRH (200 mcg) with measurement of serum TSH at baseline and then 20 and 60 minutes after TRH administration. The normal increment in TSH at 20 minutes is 5 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> with a subsequent decrease at 60 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Classically, one would expect no serum TSH response to TRH in patients with pituitary disease and a delayed response in patients with hypothalamic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75399\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75399 \">figure 1</a>). In fact, the response to TRH is highly variable in these circumstances, limiting the utility of this test in distinguishing between pituitary and hypothalamic disease as a cause of central hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A TRH stimulation test may be useful in distinguishing nonthyroidal illness from central hypothyroidism due to pituitary disease. Patients with nonthyroidal illness have a blunted nocturnal rise in serum TSH concentrations, but they usually have a normal serum TSH response to TRH. (See <a href=\"#H977108\" class=\"local\">'Transient central hypothyroidism'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid function in nonthyroidal illness&quot;, section on 'Transient central hypothyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>TRH stimulation tests (and measurement of nocturnal TSH) have been performed in childhood cancer survivors who have received cranial irradiation to detect subtle central hypothyroidism.

The majority of patients with central hypothyroidism have coexisting deficiencies in other pituitary hormones, although isolated TSH deficiency may also occur. Central hypothyroidism should be suspected in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is known hypothalamic or pituitary disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mass lesion is present in the pituitary</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism are associated with other hormonal deficiencies</p><p/><p>In hypothyroidism caused by hypothalamic or pituitary disease, TSH secretion does not increase appropriately as T4 secretion falls. Thus, we measure both serum TSH and free T4 if pituitary or hypothalamic disease is suspected. We also measure free T4 if the patient has convincing symptoms of hypothyroidism despite a normal TSH result. In patients with central hypothyroidism, the serum free T4 value is low normal or low and serum TSH may be frankly low, inappropriately normal (for the low T4), or slightly high (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> due to secretion of biologically inactive TSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67935\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67935 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;, section on 'Secondary and tertiary (central) hypothyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>It is not necessary to measure T3 in most patients with suspected central hypothyroidism. However, it may be helpful to measure T3 when the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism is uncertain. As an example, patients who are taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liothyronine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liothyronine</a> (T3) supplements or who have autonomous thyroid nodules may have suppressed TSH and low free T4 levels, similar to that seen in patients with central hypothyroidism; however, serum T3 levels are usually elevated or high normal, rather than normal or low. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'TSH low'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a history of previous hypothalamic-pituitary disease, with accompanying symptoms of deficiency or excess of other pituitary hormones, and a low or low-normal free T4 with a low or inappropriately normal TSH, the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism is straightforward. However, for patients without previous <span class=\"nowrap\">hypothalamic/pituitary</span> disease, it may be difficult to distinguish mild central hypothyroidism from mild primary hypothyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism. Some drugs can affect thyroid hormone metabolism, mimicking the thyroid function test abnormalities seen in patients with central hypothyroidism. In addition, transient central hypothyroidism may occur in some settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">TSH slightly high</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central versus primary hypothyroidism &ndash; A patient with a low serum total or free T4 concentration (eg, free T4 0.7 to 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [normal range 0.9 to 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL])</span> and a slightly high serum TSH concentration (eg, 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [normal range 0.5 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L])</span> could have either primary or central hypothyroidism. A higher serum TSH value would be expected if the patient had primary hypothyroidism, but since patients with central hypothyroidism may have elevations of biologically inactive TSH, definitive diagnosis requires further evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In this setting, we measure anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol in premenopausal women with amenorrhea; FSH in postmenopausal women; and LH and testosterone in men. A high serum TPO antibody concentration suggests chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis and primary hypothyroidism, whereas absence of anti-TPO antibodies and abnormalities in other pituitary hormones favors central hypothyroidism. Amenorrhea in premenopausal women, the absence of high serum FSH concentrations in postmenopausal women, and low serum testosterone and normal or low LH concentrations in men suggest the presence of secondary hypogonadism. Hyperprolactinemia may be present in both central and primary hypothyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">TSH low</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central hypothyroidism versus subclinical hyperthyroidism &ndash; A patient with a low-normal serum total or free T4 value and a detectable but subnormal serum TSH concentration (eg, free T4 0.9 to 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL,</span> TSH 0.2 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> could have either central hypothyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In this setting, serum T3 should be measured. Rarely, patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism who have low-normal free T4 values can have high-normal T3 values. The finding of a normal or high-normal serum T3 is consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism. We then obtain a thyroid scan and uptake, looking for thyroid autonomy. If the scan shows areas of autonomy and the 24-hour uptake is normal or high-normal, autonomously functioning thyroid nodules or multinodular goiter are the most likely cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the T3 is normal or low-normal, we evaluate for coexisting pituitary hormone abnormalities as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27846365\"><span class=\"h2\">TSH normal</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central hypothyroidism versus euthyroid hypothyroxinemia &ndash; Many conditions result in increases or decreases in serum total T4 and T3 concentrations, but little change in serum free T4 and T3 concentrations and no symptoms or signs of thyroid dysfunction. Thus, in patients with a normal TSH and low total T4 concentrations, the serum free T4 should be measured. The detection of a normal serum TSH concentration associated with a low serum total T4 and normal free T4 concentration should alert the clinician to search for one of the causes of euthyroid hypothyroxinemia, especially if the patient has no symptoms or signs of hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia&quot;, section on 'Euthyroid hypothyroxinemia due to binding protein abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug interaction &ndash; In patients with low serum total and free T4 concentrations (with a normal TSH concentration), central hypothyroidism is possible. However, certain drugs, especially antiseizure medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, may be associated with an artifactually low serum free T4 and a normal serum TSH, mimicking central hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this case, assessment of other pituitary functions and pituitary imaging may be required to definitively rule out central hypothyroidism. In addition, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) testing, where available, can be very helpful in ruling out central hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients with phenytoin-induced reductions in serum total and free T4 would have a normal TSH response to TRH administration, whereas patients with central hypothyroidism would have an absent or delayed response. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mitotane</a>, a drug used to treat adrenocortical cancer, is also associated with a low free T4 and normal TSH, but unlike phenytoin, the TSH response to TRH is blunted.

Thyroid function (TSH, free T4) should be measured six to eight weeks after surgery. If a previously undetectable TSH becomes detectable, one can consider trying to taper the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> dose while monitoring free T4 and TSH at four- to six-week intervals.</p><p/><p>There is controversy regarding the goal for free T4 in patients with central hypothyroidism taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>. In a randomized, crossover trial comparing thyroid hormone replacement regimens in patients with central hypothyroidism, higher dose T4 (1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> was superior to lower dose (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> with respect to body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The resultant serum free T4 levels were at or slightly above the upper limit of normal. The widely accepted conclusion from this study is that the levothyroxine dose should be adjusted according to the patient's symptoms and serum free T4 values, aiming to maintain the serum free T4 concentration in the upper part of the normal range. However, it is well known that patients with primary hypothyroidism who take doses of levothyroxine that suppress TSH may have improved mental health and mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and improved well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] despite the cardiovascular and skeletal risks of iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>). An analysis of a United Kingdom database of 525 patients with pituitary tumors found that 39 percent of those with central hypothyroidism taking levothyroxine had free T4 values less than 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L</span> (1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL;</span> normal range 9 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L</span> [0.7 to 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL]),</span> compared with 13 percent of patients with primary hypothyroidism taking T4, suggesting the possibility that many patients with central hypothyroidism are undertreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The authors of another study suggest that patients with central hypothyroidism may need more <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> to achieve serum T4 values in the upper half of the normal range than patients with primary hypothyroidism caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis or radioiodine therapy. In this study of clinically euthyroid patients with serum free T4 index values in the upper half of the normal range, 36 patients with central hypothyroidism were receiving more levothyroxine (155 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day,</span> 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span> than 73 patients with hypothyroidism caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis or radioiodine therapy (118 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day,</span> 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. It is unclear from this study whether aiming for a high normal free T4 in patients with central hypothyroidism results in excessive replacement therapy. In another study, women taking estrogen replacement therapy, men initiating growth hormone therapy, and patients with childhood-onset central hypothyroidism needed a higher dose of levothyroxine to maintain the free T4 in the upper half of the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>There are insufficient data to determine whether combined <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> (T4) and T3 (in physiologic doses) is superior to levothyroxine monotherapy for patients with central hypothyroidism. Patients with central hypothyroidism may have low serum free T3 concentrations despite normal or upper normal free T4 values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>]. The potential benefit of combined T4-liothyronine (T3) treatment in 29 patients with central hypothyroidism was evaluated in a five-week, crossover trial comparing thyroid replacement regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-hypothyroidism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although compared with T4 alone (1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg),</span> patients receiving combined T3 (0.16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> and T4 (1.44 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> had a small but significant improvement in total cholesterol (198 verus 194 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and normalization of ankle reflex time (380 versus 364 msec); the combined regimen resulted in supraphysiologic free T3 levels, suggesting hyperthyroidism.

The prevalence of central hypothyroidism is much lower than that of primary hypothyroidism. Pituitary mass lesions, especially pituitary adenomas, are the most common cause of central hypothyroidism. Other mass lesions that can cause central hypothyroidism include cysts and abscesses, meningiomas and dysgerminomas, pituitary adenocarcinomas and metastatic tumors, and craniopharyngiomas, which may enter the sella or remain suprasellar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55951 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of central hypothyroidism are similar to, but sometimes milder than, those of primary hypothyroidism. Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, cold intolerance, muscle cramps, and weight gain. The majority of patients with central hypothyroidism have coexisting deficiency or excesses of other pituitary hormones, although isolated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency may also occur. In patients with coexisting pituitary hormone abnormalities, the symptoms of hypothyroidism may be masked by other symptoms of hypopituitarism. (See <a href=\"#H18020398\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hypothyroidism caused by hypothalamic or pituitary disease, TSH secretion does not increase appropriately as thyroxine (T4) secretion falls. In patients with central hypothyroidism, serum free T4 is low or low normal, but serum TSH may be low, normal, or even slightly elevated (up to approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67935\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67935 \">table 3</a>). In patients with pituitary tumors, there may be laboratory evidence of deficiency or excess of other pituitary hormones, such as hypogonadism or hyperprolactinemia. (See <a href=\"#H18020102\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of central hypothyroidism is based upon clinical manifestations and thyroid function tests. We measure both serum TSH and free T4 if central hypothyroidism is suspected. We also measure free T4 if the patient has convincing symptoms of hypothyroidism despite a normal TSH result. In patients with central hypothyroidism, the serum free T4 value is low normal or low and serum TSH may be frankly low, inappropriately normal (for the low T4), or slightly high (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> due to secretion of biologically inactive TSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67935\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67935 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22447146\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without previous hypothalamic-pituitary disease, it may be difficult to distinguish mild central hypothyroidism from mild primary hypothyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism. Some drugs can affect thyroid hormone metabolism, mimicking the thyroid function test abnormalities seen in patients with central hypothyroidism. In addition, transient central hypothyroidism may occur in some settings. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with biochemical evidence of central hypothyroidism require neuroradiologic studies (preferably magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary region and biochemical assessment of the other pituitary hormones, particularly secondary adrenal insufficiency. Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> to patients with unsuspected and untreated secondary adrenal insufficiency can precipitate an acute adrenal crisis. Thus, pituitary-adrenal function should be assessed, usually by a corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test, before levothyroxine therapy is begun in all patients with central hypothyroidism, and glucocorticoid therapy should be given before or with levothyroxine if adrenal insufficiency is present.
