Management of a patient with a severe burn injury is a long-term process that addresses the local burn wound as well as the systemic, psychologic, and social consequences of the injury. </p><p>This section provides an overview of the initial care and subsequent management of patients with severe (major) burn injuries. The initial care and management of minor thermal burns are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minor-thermal-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minor thermal burns&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3280435463\"><span class=\"h1\">SEVERE BURN INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A severe (major) burn is any burn injury that is complicated by major trauma or inhalation injury, chemical burn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108485 \">table 1</a>), high-voltage electrical burn, and, in general for adults, any burn encompassing over 20 percent of the total body surface area (TBSA), excluding superficial burns (first-degree burns) such as sunburn. Those at the greatest risk for death are those at the extremes of age and burn injury in association with serious comorbidities. For older adults and young children, a burn encompassing less that 20 percent of the TBSA may be considered severe. Severe burns usually require initial care in a specialized intensive care unit of a burn center. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although burns involving eyes, ears, face, hands, feet, or perineum that are likely to result in cosmetic or functional impairment should be cared for in a burn center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 2</a>), not all will require management in an intensive care unit.

In both scenarios, emergency care follows the principles of the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines for assessment and stabilization of airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure, and environment control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Primary and secondary assessments for the severity (partial- or full-thickness) and extent (total body surface area [TBSA]) of the burn, and an evaluation for associated life-threatening injuries, are promptly performed. Ambient room temperature should be increased to prevent hypothermia and reduce the patient's stress response.</p><p>If the patient does not present initially to a designated burn center, patients with any of the criteria given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 2</a>) should be transferred as soon as stabilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. If transportation is not feasible, or if no burn center is available, the patient should be admitted to an ICU for management in the interim, until transfer can be arranged. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2366625912\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria for intensive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burn patients who require mechanical ventilation, require cardiac or other hemodynamic monitoring to guide fluid therapy or monitoring for other reasons, or have risk factors for multisystem organ failure should be managed in an intensive care setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictive scoring systems in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1950734230\"><span class=\"h2\">Palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although mortality rates related to burn injury have steadily declined, some patients with severe burns have such a poor chance for survival that they (or their health care proxy) may elect to withhold treatment. Patients with very large burns and inhalation injury, particularly in the setting of other significant medical comorbidities, are at increased risk for death. A patient with a Baux score (age + TBSA, which correlates with mortality) or a revised Baux score (age + TBSA + 17 [presence of inhalation injury]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] of more than 140 to 150 (little to no hope for survival) may elect to forego any specific burn treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A patient can also present with &quot;Do not <span class=\"nowrap\">resuscitate/Do</span> not intubate&quot; or other advanced directives that are upheld by their surrogates that prohibit heroic efforts at resuscitation or other life-prolonging measures. In these patients, pain and anxiety are controlled. Patients can receive such palliative care without being transferred to a burn center, but many centers prefer to send these patients under the premise that transfer to a specialized center may provide hope for any chance of survival.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial approach to fluid resuscitation, fluid selection, and estimating initial fluid requirements in adults and children are discussed separately (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-adult-burn-injury-fluid-resuscitation-parkland-crystalloid-estimate\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Once a patient has progressed through the initial resuscitation, ongoing fluid needs depend upon the size of the burn, presence of inhalation injury, any comorbidities, and any signs of multiorgan dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in adults&quot;, section on 'Fluid resuscitation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in children&quot;, section on 'Fluid resuscitation'</a>.) </p><p>The goal of ongoing fluid therapy in the ICU is to maintain end-organ perfusion and prevent shock. Fluid resuscitation with intravenous crystalloid solution is adjusted to maintain urine output at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for children and 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for adults; however, most adult burn units accept 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour,</span> regardless of the patient's weight. The effectiveness of perfusion is monitored using a central venous catheter, cardiac output monitor, and urinary catheter for the severely burned patient. A nasogastric tube is placed for gastrointestinal decompression.

In one review that included nearly 40,000 patients, the overall incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 0.08 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The highest risk was for patients with burns greater than 20 percent total body surface area (TBSA), older patients, and African Americans. </p><p>In general, thromboprophylaxis in burn patients does not differ from that of other patients treated in an intensive care unit setting. Those patients with severe burn injury creating a hypermetabolic, hypercatabolic response may require different dosing for therapy, but this remains controversial.<strong> </strong>Also, during the resuscitation, there are so many fluid shifts that the volume of distribution may be affected with subcutaneous administration of drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-molecular-weight-heparin-for-venous-thromboembolic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sequential compression devices can be used and can also decrease risk of deep vein thrombosis, but not more so compared with pharmacologic methods. The main benefit of mechanical prophylaxis compared with pharmacologic methods is a decrease in bleeding complications. </p><p>Physiotherapy and early ambulation are also important for preventing thromboembolism but are also for helping the burn patient maintain lean body mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643780534\"><span class=\"h3\">Antimicrobial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of prophylactic antibiotics is controversial.

There is some evidence that prophylactic antibiotics may improve outcomes for burn patients requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, the majority of these patients did not require surgical intervention, which leads to the question of severity of burn. Other authors have found some benefit in using prophylactic antibiotics in patients with inhalation injury, but the results have not yet been duplicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated for patients with burn wound infection or sepsis.

Early recognition helps guide the approach to initial and ongoing resuscitation. The physiologic changes in coagulation in severely burned patients are characterized by changes in the innate coagulation cascade and dysfunctional fibrinolysis that are directly proportional to the severity of injury. The etiology of the coagulopathy is thought to be due to the fluid shifts, hemodilution, and hypothermia related to the resuscitation. There are currently no established treatment paradigms for burn-associated coagulopathy. Current recommendations focus on prevention, supportive care, and maintaining end-organ perfusion.

The hypermetabolic response in burn patients is characterized by a hyperdynamic circulatory response with massive protein and lipid catabolism, total body protein loss, muscle wasting, peripheral insulin resistance, increased energy expenditure, increased body temperature, increased risk of infection, and stimulated synthesis of acute phase proteins located in the liver and intestinal mucosa.

Some commercially available dressings may allow unexcised burns to be examined less frequently but also may increase the risk for infection, pain, and hypothermia (depending upon the size of injury). Wounds that have been debrided <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excised but not autografted will need temporary coverage to decrease risk for infection until either the patient heals the debrided wound primarily or definitive autograft coverage is provided. The location of the examination depends on the size and depth of the injury, and how much pain the patient is experiencing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care&quot;</a>.) </p><p>New grafts are usually kept in long-term dressings for three to four days before being examined. Too frequent examinations may lead to shearing and reduced adherence of the grafts. Examinations can be performed in the intensive care unit or operating room.

The length of time to accomplish full excision and burn coverage depends upon the size of injury. As an example, a 90 percent burn cannot be autografted in a single setting, but may be excised and covered multiple times with skin substitutes and autografts until all wounds are covered.

This is due in part to the immunologic dysfunction in severely burned patients. Burn wound sepsis can also lead to multiorgan dysfunction and death. Nosocomial infections (eg, central venous catheters, ventilator associated) and emerging multi-drug-resistant strains of bacteria and fungi contribute to burn wound infections, sepsis, and associated death. Recognition and treatment of burn wound sepsis is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Burn wound infection and sepsis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H752093844\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall mortality from a severe burn injury ranges from 3 to 55 percent, depending upon the extent (eg, size and depth) of the burn as well as the presence of inhalation injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The chance of survival after a severe burn increased steadily in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century due to a number of therapeutic developments, including vigorous fluid resuscitation, early burn wound excision, advances in critical care and nutrition, topical antibiotics, and the evolution of specialized burn centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Among patients hospitalized for burns, survival exceeds 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>]. In one retrospective review of 238 severely burned patients, the survival rate for patients with &gt;95 percent total body surface area (TBSA) burns was approximately 50 percent for children aged 14 years and younger, 75 percent in adults 45 to 64 years, and 30 percent in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a review of burn injury comparing older with younger patients, older patients had significantly increased morbidity and mortality.</p><p>A number of studies have investigated the variables associated with increased mortality in burn patients. One-half of early deaths from burns (within the first 10 days) may be related to inadequate resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/25,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,34-36</a>]. In a retrospective review of 1665 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital (mean burn size 14&plusmn;20 percent TBSA, mean age 21&plusmn;20 years), three risk factors for death were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age greater than 60 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial-thickness and full-thickness burns covering over 40 percent TBSA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhalation injury </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96426407\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of a patient with a severe burn injury is a long-term process that addresses the local burn wound care as well as the systemic, psychologic, and social consequences of the injury. (See <a href=\"#H2965687942\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A severe (major) burn is any burn injury that is complicated by major trauma or inhalation injury, chemical burn, high-voltage electrical burn, and, in general for adults, any burn encompassing over 20 percent of the total body surface area, excluding superficial burns such as sunburn. (See <a href=\"#H3280435463\" class=\"local\">'Severe burn injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If emergency care is not provided at a designated burn center, the patients with the criteria listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 2</a>) should be transferred to a burn center as soon as stabilized. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive care unit management includes fluid resuscitation, cardiovascular stabilization, continuation of respiratory support, pain control, and local management of burn wounds initiated in the emergency department. The goal of the intensive care is to maintain end-organ perfusion and prevent shock. (See <a href=\"#H1607614\" class=\"local\">'Intensive care management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hypermetabolic response in burn patients is characterized by a hyperdynamic circulatory response with massive protein and lipid catabolism. Measures for attenuating hypermetabolism in severe burn patients are listed above and discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The local care of burn wounds includes daily examination of unexcised burns and early excision and grafting, generally between 6 and 24 hours after the injury. The length of time to accomplish full excision and burn coverage depends upon the size of injury. (See <a href=\"#H768269944\" class=\"local\">'Burn wound management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term management includes management of long-term wound complications (eg, contractures), optimization of nutritional support, and psychosocial support to return to work and for re-immersion into society.
