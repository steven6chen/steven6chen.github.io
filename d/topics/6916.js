SCLC occurs predominantly in smokers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SCLC is distinguished clinically from most types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, and the early development of metastases. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, a rare form of lung cancer, and extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas are generally treated with the same chemotherapy regimens used for SCLC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrapulmonary small cell cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H4047701511\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>SCLC usually presents with disseminated disease, and treatment strategies have focused on systemic therapy. Although SCLC is highly responsive to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), it commonly relapses within months despite treatment.</p><p>The initial management of patients with extensive stage SCLC will be reviewed here.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation decreases the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases in patients who have responded to systemic chemotherapy, although its impact on overall survival is uncertain. For patients with a response to systemic chemotherapy, thoracic radiation may be of benefit in increasing the percentage of long-term survivors.</p><p>Patients with SCLC rarely survive more than a few months without treatment. However, SCLC is highly responsive to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs, and chemotherapy dramatically prolongs survival compared with best supportive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

SCLC is sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and the use of platinum-based combination regimens has resulted in a significant improvement in survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F100442\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100442 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with extensive stage SCLC, we recommend combination chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H193053207\" class=\"local\">'Extensive stage disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Platinum-based combinations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest a two-drug combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66855 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75586\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75586 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Regimens substituting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epirubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epirubicin</a> for etoposide are reasonable alternatives. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cisplatin plus irinotecan'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Topotecan plus cisplatin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Epirubicin plus cisplatin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial therapy is usually limited to four to six cycle of induction chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Duration of chemotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Alternating and sequential regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The use of maintenance chemotherapy, three- or four-drug combinations, and alternating or sequential non-cross-resistant regimens have not been shown to offer substantial benefits compared with a two-drug combination; thus, these approaches are not routinely utilized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with extensive stage SCLC with favorable tumor response or better at the completion of chemotherapy and a good performance status, we suggest prophylactic cranial irradiation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylactic-cranial-irradiation-for-patients-with-small-cell-lung-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Extensive-stage SCLC'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ES-SCLC who have had a favorable response to chemotherapy but in whom there is evidence of residual disease within the chest identified on computed tomography (CT), we recommend thoracic radiation therapy (RT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H193051232\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only limited data are available from randomized trials to guide treatment in elderly patients. We suggest that elderly patients be treated with the same doses and regimens as younger patients, if their overall medical condition is satisfactory (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A comprehensive geriatric assessment prior to initiating treatment may be useful in assessing whether or not an individual patient is a candidate for chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Elderly patients'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with limited stage (LS)-SCLC is discussed separately.
