The two main <em>Borrelia</em> species involved in North America are <em>Borrelia hermsii</em> (in the mountainous West) and <em>Borrelia turicatae</em> (in the Southwest and South Central region). Other tick-borne species cause relapsing fever on other continents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LBRF is caused by <em>Borrelia recurrentis</em>. It is principally a disease seen in the developing world or among refugees from developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is spread from person to person by the body louse and can result in large epidemics.</p><p/><p>As the name implies, relapsing fever is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, which accompany spirochetemia. The disease relapses are due to antigenic variation by the spirochetes.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of relapsing fever will be reviewed here. Discussions of the microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of relapsing fever, as well as <em>Borrelia miyamotoi</em>, a <em>Borrelia</em> species related to the agents of relapsing fever, are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of relapsing fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=borrelia-miyamotoi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Borrelia miyamotoi infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112627895\"><span class=\"h2\">Course of fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapsing fever presents with the sudden onset of fever, punctuated by an intervening afebrile period, and then recurrent fevers. The temperature is usually above 39&deg;C, and may be as high as 43&deg;C. The incubation period between the exposure and the first fever is between 3 and 12 days.</p><p>The first fever episode ends by a crisis phase, which lasts for approximately 15 to 30 minutes and consists of rigors, a further elevation in temperature, and an increase in pulse and blood pressure. The crisis phase is followed by profuse diaphoresis, falling temperature, and hypotension, which usually persist for several hours. Mortality from untreated relapsing fever is most common during the crisis and its immediate aftermath. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In both tick-borne and louse-borne relapsing fever, the interval between fevers ranges from 4 to 14 days. However, the pattern of fever varies depending upon the causative agent:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF), multiple febrile periods each last from one to three days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64476\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64476 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF), the first episode of fever is unremitting for three to six days; it is typically followed by a single milder episode.</p><p/><p>Following the initial symptomatic infection, and during subsequent relapses, a succession of <em>Borrelia</em> serotypes appear in the blood. Each serotype is individually defined by antigenically distinct surface proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Studies in experimental mice infected with <em>B. turicatae</em> suggest that these variable proteins also determine differences in disease expression. As an example, the propensity for invasion of the central nervous system with <em>B. turicatae</em> infection is determined by variability in a single surface protein of the bacterium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever#H302821251\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of relapsing fever&quot;, section on 'Variable major proteins'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to recurring fevers, patients with relapsing fever may present with a variety of other signs and symptoms. Some may be seen in patients with both TBRF and LBRF, whereas others are typically associated with a specific pathogen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generalized</strong> &ndash; Patients with relapsing fever generally present with nonspecific symptoms (eg, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, shaking chills, and abdominal complaints). These symptoms may accompany the first and subsequent febrile episodes, although the first episode of illness tends to be the most severe. The severity of relapsing fever generally correlates directly with the number of spirochetes in the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one report, nausea with vomiting was the predominant symptom in febrile children 11 years old or younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic</strong> &ndash; Patients with relapsing fever may develop neurologic complications. Neurologic manifestation, such as delirium, apathy, stupor, dizziness, or, rarely, coma can be seen in both TBRF and LBRF. In LBRF, these neurologic manifestations are thought to be secondary to spirochetemia, rather than direct invasion of organisms into the central nervous system (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, localized neurologic signs (eg, hemiplegia, facial palsy, myelitis, meningitis, and radiculopathy) are more common with TBRF and are due to direct invasion of spirochetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Visual loss may be permanent in patients who develop bilateral iridocyclitis or panophthalmitis. Localized neurologic manifestations are more likely to present during subsequent, rather than the initial febrile period. As an example, cranial neuritis typically presents in the second or third febrile episode, not the first. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiopulmonary</strong> &ndash; Patients may also experience cardiac or respiratory complications. Myocarditis appears to be common in both TBRF and LBRF, and has been reported as a prominent feature in fatal cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pulmonary symptoms range from acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is typically seen in patients with TBRF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], to a nonproductive cough in patients with LBRF. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematologic</strong> &ndash; Hematologic complications can be seen in patients with LBRF. Such patients can present with a bleeding disorder, which is probably the consequence of thrombocytopenia, impaired hepatic production of clotting factors, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blockage of small vessels by aggregates of spirochetes, erythrocytes, and platelets.</p><p/><p><strong>Physical examination</strong> &mdash; Exam findings seen in patients with both TBRF and LBRF include splenomegaly that may be accompanied by abdominal or left shoulder pain, and hepatomegaly, which is seen in the majority of patients with LBRF and in about 10 percent of patients with TBRF. In patients with myocarditis, a gallop on cardiac auscultation is commonly seen. Although patients with relapsing fever frequently complain of polyarthralgia, enlarged, painful joints are unusual.</p><p>Other exam findings, such as localized neurologic findings, are more common in TBRF than LBRF. Bell's palsy (unilateral or bilateral) and deafness from seventh or eighth cranial nerve involvement are the most common forms of cranial neuritis in TBRF. See above.</p><p>By contrast, patients with LBRF may have findings suggestive of a bleeding disorder, such as epistaxis, petechiae, and ecchymoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Subarachnoid hemorrhage has been observed, perhaps due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. See above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">General laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonspecific laboratory findings are generally seen in patients with relapsing fever. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild-to-moderate normocytic anemia is common, but frank hemolysis and hemoglobinuria do not occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocyte counts are usually in the normal range or only slightly elevated; however, there can be leukopenia during the crisis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet counts can fall below <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be elevated, sometimes above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis can occur with elevated serum concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin and aminotransferases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times may be moderately prolonged. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoalbuminemia can be seen, but this finding is more often due to malnutrition than hepatic dysfunction.</p><p/><p>When analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is performed (eg, when there are signs of meningitis or meningoencephalitis), the CSF examination usually reveals a mononuclear pleocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mildly to moderately elevated protein levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Glucose concentrations are usually not depressed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112628063\"><span class=\"h2\">Other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with myocarditis, the electrocardiogram may reveal a prolonged QTc interval. Some patients may also have cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on chest radiograph.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2533598688\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women with relapsing fever tend to have a more severe and prolonged illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, transplacental transmission of the infection can occur. Relapsing fever during pregnancy frequently leads to abortion or stillbirth; however, congenital malformations as a consequence of relapsing fever have not been reported. A newborn may also be infected shortly after birth, and neonates with relapsing fever are at increased risk for complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>A murine model of gestational relapsing fever infection found that infection during pregnancy causes intrauterine growth retardation, placental damage and inflammation, impaired fetal circulation, and decreased maternal hemoglobin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a murine model, spirochetes frequently crossed the maternal-fetal barrier, leading to infection of the fetus. The model closely parallels human infection and provides potential mechanisms to account for the observed human pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112629300\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapsing fever should be considered in patients who have both of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic relapsing fevers, especially if the recurrent fevers are accompanied by the crisis phenomenon. (See <a href=\"#H112627895\" class=\"local\">'Course of fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An epidemiologic history of exposure to soft-bodied ticks or body lice in geographic areas where louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) or tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is endemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116940 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever#H2699890493\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of relapsing fever&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p/><p>To evaluate the patient for relapsing fever, we first perform thin and thick smears of blood to see if the organism can be identified. If the organism is not identified on smear, but there is a high clinical suspicion for disease, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing should be performed. </p><p>Patients with suspected neurologic involvement should have a lumbar puncture. In patients with meningitis or meningoencephalitis, microscopic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reveal spirochetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], but their presence in the subarachnoid space is more likely revealed by PCR or inoculation of the CSF into mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Direct visualization procedures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H112628544\" class=\"local\">'Polymerase chain reaction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2718688384\" class=\"local\">'Animal inoculation'</a> below.)</p><p>Culture and serologic techniques are less helpful when trying to diagnose relapsing fever. Culture can be difficult to perform and is not routinely available. The primary indication for serologic testing is retrospective confirmation of a diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2081564644\" class=\"local\">'Cultures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Serologies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112629306\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic methods</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Direct visualization procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct visualization includes identifying the organism in blood or in tissue specimens.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identifying the organism in blood</strong> &ndash; Thin and thick smears of blood should be obtained to see if the organism can be visualized. The optimum time to obtain blood is between the fever's onset and its peak. Spirochetes are usually unable to be visualized in blood once the temperature is declining or back to the normal range in the absence of antipyretics. With current automated procedures for blood smear analysis, a request for a manual examination of the blood smear must be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>On thin smear, Giemsa or Wright stains typically reveal spirochetes if the concentration of microorganisms is greater than 10<sup>5</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/mL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63059\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63059 \">picture 1</a>). As many as 200 oil immersion fields should be viewed before judging the smear to be negative. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A thick smear is able to detect at least one log fewer organisms (ie, 10<sup>4</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/mL</span> of blood). To perform a thick smear, the slide should first be treated with 0.5 percent acetic acid to lyse hemoglobin, and then stained with Giemsa or Wright stain. The acetic acid treatment can be omitted if the smear is stained with acridine orange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], which binds to nucleic acids in the spirochetes. The slide should then be examined microscopically under ultraviolet light. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For both thin and thick smears, direct or indirect immunofluorescence is another procedure that can be used to visualize spirochetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A fluorescein-labeled polyclonal antibody to <em>Borrelia </em>species is commercially available and is useful for detecting relapsing fever spirochetes in blood or in tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other procedures have also been used to visualize the organism. As an example, examination of the buffy coat and overlying plasma can detect as few as 10<sup>3</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">spirochetes/mL</span> of blood. Further enrichment for spirochetes in the blood may be achieved with a two-step centrifugation procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another diagnostic maneuver is the use of a wet mount technique. Uncentrifuged plasma or the concentrated buffy coat is examined by phase contrast or dark field microscopy, and coiling, uncoiling, and bending movements of the spirochetes can be visualized as they swim among the erythrocytes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A smear or wet mount properly evaluated can be diagnostic since <em>Borrelia</em> spp are an unlikely contaminant, and an asymptomatic bacteremic carrier state is not known to occur. However, in inexperienced hands, stain artifacts in blood smears and incorrect interpretation of wet mounts may produce a false diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identifying the organism in tissue specimens</strong> &ndash; The spirochetes can be detected in tissue sections with silver stains, such as Warthin-Starry or modified Dieterle, or by immunofluorescence with conjugated antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/8,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112628544\"><span class=\"h3\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCR testing is useful for the diagnosis of relapsing fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

A suspected exposure to soft ticks consists of recently being in a high-risk setting (eg, a sojourn in a mountain cabin in North America where relapsing fever has recently occurred, or entering a cave where relapsing fever was acquired by other visitors); there is usually no sign of a bite. Post-exposure prophylaxis can also be used after an accidental inoculation with infected blood or culture medium in the laboratory, hospital, or clinic.</p><p>The efficacy of this <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> regimen was demonstrated in a randomized trial of 93 healthy individuals in Israel with a suspected tick exposure in a cave [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. At three weeks, 10 cases of TBRF (defined as a patient with fever and a positive blood smear) were diagnosed; all were in the placebo group (attack rate 22 percent).

This is an arthropod-borne infection that occurs in two major forms: tick-borne (TBRF) and louse-borne (LBRF). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsing fever presents with the sudden onset of fever, punctuated by an intervening afebrile period, and then recurrent fevers. The temperature is usually above 39&deg;C and may be as high as 43&deg;C. The first fever episode ends in a crisis phase that lasts approximately 15 to 30 minutes and consists of rigors, further elevations in temperature, and increases in pulse and blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H112627895\" class=\"local\">'Course of fever'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients present with nonspecific symptoms (eg, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, shaking chills, and abdominal complaints). Patients can also develop neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, or hematologic complications; the clinical presentation depends in part upon the form of infection (ie, TBRF versus LBRF). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Other signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsing fever should be considered in patients who have both characteristic relapsing fevers and an epidemiologic history of exposure to body lice or soft-bodied ticks in geographic areas where LBRF or TBRF are endemic. (See <a href=\"#H112629300\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To evaluate the patient for relapsing fever, thin and thick smears of blood should be performed to see if the organism can be identified. Polymerase chain reaction testing can be performed if the organism is not identified on smear, but there continues to be a high clinical suspicion for disease. (See <a href=\"#H112629306\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic methods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer antimicrobial therapy to patients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of relapsing fever. The mortality rates for untreated TBRF and LBRF and are in the ranges of 4 to 10 percent and 10 to 70 percent, respectively; but with prompt antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate is substantially reduced. (See <a href=\"#H4134190833\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with TBRF present with severe symptoms and require hospitalization. For such patients, we suggest an intravenous beta-lactam, such as penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for initial therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116192\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116192 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). There have been decades of experience using penicillin to treat relapsing fever. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Tick-borne relapsing fever'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without central nervous system (CNS) involvement, the duration of treatment for TBRF is generally 10 days. The patient can be switched to oral therapy when clinically stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with CNS involvement and for pregnant women, the duration of treatment should be extended for up to 14 days, and IV therapy with penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> should be continued for the entire course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with TBRF who cannot take a beta-lactam, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously) should be used if possible. Macrolides (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>) are typically administered only if the patient cannot take a beta-lactam or a tetracycline, since there is less experience with these agents. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Tick-borne relapsing fever'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3229013778\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations for pregnant women and young children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with LBRF should be treated with a single dose of intramuscular penicillin or a single dose of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>. For those unable to take one of these agents, a macrolide can be used. (See <a href=\"#H760808336\" class=\"local\">'Louse-borne relapsing fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients who are treated for relapsing fever should be monitored for evidence of a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR) after the first dose of therapy. Signs and symptoms of JHR include rigors, myalgias, further rise in the body temperature, increased respiratory rate, and hypotension lasting up to 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best way to prevent relapsing fever is to decrease louse and tick exposures. In addition, post-exposure prophylaxis with an antibiotic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>) can be administered following a suspected tick exposure in an endemic area.
