Use of the term carcinoid implies well-differentiated (low- to intermediate-grade) histology and is not traditionally used to describe high-grade poorly differentiated NETs, which are now classified as neuroendocrine carcinomas. Well-differentiated NETs that arise in the pancreas, while histologically similar to those arising in the tubular portion of the gastrointestinal tract, are not referred to as &quot;carcinoids&quot; but instead as pancreatic NETs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60365 \">table 1</a>).

In a series of 35,618 NETs (which included pancreatic NETs as well as gastrointestinal NETs [GINETs] at all sites) reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the age-adjusted incidence for nonpancreatic primaries was 4.7 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The annual incidence rate for African Americans was higher than for Caucasians (6.46 versus 4.6 per 100,000), and the incidence for males was slightly higher than for females (4.97 versus 4.49 per 100,000). The median age at diagnosis for all patients with NETs was 63 years.</p><p>Roughly similar incidence rates were found in a database study from a Swedish registry that focused on 5184 GINETs tumors seen between 1958 and 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Incidence rates for men and women were 2.0 and 2.4 per 100,000, respectively. Although clear risk factors have not been identified, a regression analysis of this database suggested that risk was increased in the setting of a family history of a GINET in a first-degree relative (relative risk 3.6).</p><p>The incidence of well-differentiated NETs has been rising over time in the United States and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. As an example, in an analysis of 64,971 NETs reported to the SEER registry, the age-adjusted incidence rate for all NETs rose from 1.09 to 6.98 per 100,000 between 1973 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The increase is probably partly due to increased detection on radiographic imaging and endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3796865\"><span class=\"h2\">Distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distribution of NETs has shifted over time in the United States. In a report from the SEER database of 11,427 cases treated between 1973 and 1997, the majority were located in the gastrointestinal tract (55 percent) and bronchopulmonary system (30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Within the gastrointestinal tract, most NETs arose in the small intestine (45 percent, most commonly in the ileum), followed by the rectum (20 percent), appendix (16 percent), colon (11 percent), and stomach (7 percent). However, since the implementation of screening colonoscopy (approximately in the year 2000), the proportion of patients diagnosed with rectal NETs has been greater than the proportion of those diagnosed with small intestinal NETs in 12 of 13 SEER registry reporting agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Distribution may differ in other geographic areas. As an example, colorectal NETs may be more frequent in the <span class=\"nowrap\">Asia/Pacific</span> region as compared with Europe, where GINETs are more commonly found in the stomach and ileum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. An important point is that the SEER database may be inconsistent in recording tumors that are not considered &quot;malignant&quot; (ie, small gastric NETs that are encountered at endoscopy in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis).

NETs arise from enterochromaffin (neuroendocrine) cells of the aerodigestive tract. The term enterochromaffin refers to the ability to stain with potassium chromate (chromaffin), a feature of cells that contain serotonin.</p><p>While most NETs are relatively slow-growing neoplasms, some behave aggressively. Histologic grade and differentiation correlate closely with clinical behavior. Grade refers to the proliferative activity of tumors, commonly measured by the mitotic rate (number of mitotic figures per 10 high-powered fields) or the Ki-67 index. In contrast, differentiation refers to the extent to which neoplastic cells resemble their non-neoplastic counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The most recent nomenclature for NETs of the digestive system from the World Health Organization (WHO) distinguishes two broad subgroups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60365 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-differentiated NETs, which are further subdivided into low grade and intermediate grade according to proliferative rate. Intermediate-grade NETs arising in the lung (but not elsewhere) are referred to as atypical carcinoids. In general, clinical behavior is relatively indolent.

In general, midgut gastrointestinal tract NETs (GINETs) produce serotonin and other vasoactive substances that give rise to the typical carcinoid syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56015 \">table 4</a>).

The tumors are derived from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells.</p><p>The prevailing hypothesis is that ECL cells develop into NETs after chronic stimulation by the high gastrin levels that occur in patients with atrophic gastritis. This is supported by the observation that regression of gastric NETs can be achieved by antrectomy, which is occasionally recommended.
