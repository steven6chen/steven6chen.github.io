Its primary effect is to block the potassium channels, but it can also block sodium and calcium channels and the beta and alpha adrenergic receptors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approved clinical use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> has been limited to refractory ventricular arrhythmias because of a relatively high incidence of side effects that can range in severity from mild to potentially lethal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57845\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57845 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The use of lower doses (200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> may allow amiodarone to be given safely and effectively in atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter. However, as will be described below, even low doses of therapy are associated with significant adverse effects, particularly thyroid, pulmonary, neurologic, skin, ocular, and bradycardic events (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57845\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57845 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Many of these effects are due to the tissue accumulation of amiodarone with long-term oral therapy and are not seen with short-term intravenous therapy.</p><p>Guidelines for the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> were published by the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It was estimated that the prevalence of side effects was as high as 15 percent in the first year and as high as 50 percent with long-term therapy. On the other hand, the need to stop amiodarone because of serious adverse effects is thought to be about 20 percent. In a meta-analysis of trials of low-dose therapy, there was a significantly higher rate of drug discontinuation with amiodarone compared to placebo (22.9 versus 15.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The major side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> will be reviewed here.

Thus, most patients receiving IV amiodarone are on continuous electrocardiographic monitoring with frequent assessment of vital signs. Such monitoring is appropriate in all patients due to the potential for hypotension and arrhythmias (eg, torsades de pointes or bradycardia due to AV block or conversion to sinus rhythm with sinus bradycardia).

This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Summarized briefly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary toxicity generally correlates more closely with the total cumulative dose than with serum drug levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a result, pulmonary toxicity usually occurs several months to as late as several years after the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, there are anecdotal cases of severe pulmonary toxicity developing within two to three weeks of therapy with low cumulative doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial reports in which patients were usually treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> doses &ge;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> noted a 5 to 15 percent incidence of pulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. However, the incidence is lower with lower maintenance doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/2,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7</a>]. This was best illustrated in a meta-analysis of four randomized trials of 1465 patients in whom low dose amiodarone (mean 150 to 330 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> given to patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction) was compared to placebo for a minimum of one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There was a nonsignificant trend toward an increased incidence of pulmonary toxicity with amiodarone (1.9 versus 0.7 percent, odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 5.3).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several different types of pulmonary toxicity. Chronic interstitial pneumonitis is most common; other manifestations include organizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a solitary pulmonary mass. One characteristic finding in all patients exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is the presence of numerous foamy macrophages in the air spaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53653\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53653 \">picture 1</a>). These cells are filled with amiodarone-phospholipid complexes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nonproductive cough and dyspnea are present in 50 of 75 percent of affected individuals at presentation. Pleuritic pain, weight loss, fever (33 to 50 percent of cases), and malaise can also occur. The physical examination often reveals bilateral inspiratory crackles, while clubbing is not seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial lung function studies are not helpful for predicting pulmonary toxicity. Although the DLCO is often decreased in patients with pulmonary toxicity, there is usually no premonitory change in DLCO among asymptomatic patients in whom symptomatic disease subsequently develops. As a result, the DLCO is <strong>not</strong> useful as a predictive index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In one report, for example, most asymptomatic patients with a fall in DLCO of more than 20 percent did not develop pulmonary toxicity over the next year despite continued <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> pulmonary toxicity is one of exclusion. The differential diagnosis of pulmonary processes that can present similarly to amiodarone toxicity includes heart failure, infectious pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> pulmonary toxicity consists primarily of stopping amiodarone. Corticosteroid therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 40 to 60 mg per day, with a taper over two to six months) can be life saving for severe cases and for patients with less severe disease in whom withdrawal of amiodarone is not desirable. Due to its accumulation in fatty tissues and long elimination half-life (25 to 100 days), pulmonary toxicity may initially progress despite drug discontinuation and may recur upon steroid withdrawal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Preexisting pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between preexisting lung disease and the development of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> pulmonary toxicity has been reported in some series. However, it is possible that these patients merely have limited pulmonary reserve and thus become symptomatic earlier in their course than other individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid dysfunction (including both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism) is a common complication of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> therapy. Although initial reports using higher doses noted hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism in up to 20 percent of patients, the risk is lower (about 3 to 4 percent) when lower doses are used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57845\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57845 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Underlying thyroid status and iodine intake appear to influence the incidence and type of thyroid dysfunction seen with amiodarone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The effect of warfarin is potentiated by thyrotoxicosis and attenuated in hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In any patient with amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction who is also taking warfarin, the International Normalized Ratio (INR) should be monitored closely and appropriate adjustments in warfarin dosing made.

The overall incidence of bradycardic events has been about 5 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57845\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57845 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the meta-analysis cited above of chronic low-dose amiodarone (mean 150 to 330 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> the incidence of bradycardic events was significantly greater than with placebo (3.3 versus 1.4 percent, OR 2.2, 95 CI 1.1 to 4.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Bradycardia requiring a permanent pacemaker with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> therapy appears to be a particular concern with amiodarone in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation who have had a myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and may also be of greater concern in women than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Pacing to maintain continuous and homogeneous activation of the atria in such patients also may reduce the frequency of AF recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of pacemakers in the prevention of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of greater potential concern is amiodarone-induced prolongation of repolarization and the QT interval due to blockade of the potassium channels. Ventricular arrhythmias may arise in this setting due to early afterdepolarization-dependent triggered activity. However, the incidence of proarrhythmia is very low with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, with an incidence of torsades de pointes below 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the meta-analysis of low-dose therapy, there were no cases of torsades de pointes in the 738 patients treated with amiodarone for at least one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> has much less of this proarrhythmic effect than other class III drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>, particularly when given in lower doses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57845\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57845 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/1,2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15</a>]. Several factors contribute to the rarity of TdP with amiodarone: lack of reverse use dependence; concurrent blockade of the L-type calcium channels; and less heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization (less QT dispersion). However, the exact electrophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the low proarrhythmic activity of amiodarone are incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Torsades de pointes associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> therapy is more likely to occur in women and is much more likely to occur with other factors that can cause QT prolongation such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and certain antiarrhythmic drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid dysfunction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-and-thyroid-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone and thyroid dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In up to 5 percent of patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> can directly cause both sinus bradycardia and AV nodal block, due primarily to its calcium channel blocking activity. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Sinus bradycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a theoretical concern for proarrhythmia with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> because of its prolongation of repolarization and the QT interval due to blockade of the potassium channels. However, the incidence of proarrhythmia is very low with amiodarone, with an incidence of torsades de pointes below 1 percent per year. When torsades de pointes does occurs with the use of amiodarone, it is much more likely to occur with other factors that can cause QT prolongation such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and concomitant use of certain other antiarrhythmic drugs. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transient rise in serum aminotransferase concentrations occurs in approximately 25 percent (range 15 to 50 percent) of patients soon after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is begun. However, symptomatic hepatitis occurs in less than 3 percent of patients, and potential complications such as cirrhosis and hepatic failure occur very infrequently. Although the relation of hepatotoxicity to cumulative dose and duration of therapy is uncertain, it is likely that cumulative dose correlates with overall toxicity. While patients are usually asymptomatic, the drug should be discontinued if there is more than a twofold elevation in serum aminotransferases. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Hepatotoxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corneal microdeposits occur in most patients receiving long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> therapy, while some patients also develop lenticular opacities. While corneal microdeposits do not reduce visual acuity, ocular symptoms may occur, including halo vision (colored rings around lights), photophobia, and blurred vision. The presence of microdeposits is not considered a contraindication to continued amiodarone therapy since visual acuity is rarely affected. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Corneal microdeposits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of other side effects can manifest with the chronic use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, including dermatologic (photosensitivity and skin discoloration), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, constipation), neurologic (tremor, ataxia), genitourinary (epididymitis), and altered lipid concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> can interfere with the hepatic metabolism of several antiarrhythmic drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>), possibly leading to supratherapeutic plasma concentrations if the dose is not reduced. It also predictably interferes with the metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, often requiring at least a 25 percent reduction in warfarin dose. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is primarily given for short-term management of serious ventricular arrhythmias and has a different electrophysiologic and pharmacologic profile from oral amiodarone. The one common problem noted with intravenous amiodarone is hypotension, which can occur in up to 26 percent of patients. However, many of the adverse effects associated with oral amiodarone described below are due to tissue accumulation of the drug with long-term therapy and are not seen with short-term use of intravenous amiodarone. (See <a href=\"#H1065678398\" class=\"local\">'Side effects of IV amiodarone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Zimetbaum P.
