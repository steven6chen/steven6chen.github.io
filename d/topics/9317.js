Its efficacy in different clinical conditions is discussed on the appropriate topic reviews. Use of other circulatory assist devices, the cardiopulmonary assist device and the left ventricular assist device, is discussed elsewhere.

The balloons are manufactured in sizes between 20 and 50 cc.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mobile console that contains the system for helium transfer as well as computer control of the inflation and deflation cycle. </p><p/><p>The catheter is inserted in most cases through a common femoral artery and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance such that the distal end is positioned in the proximal descending aorta, usually about one centimeter distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Alternative insertion sites, such as the right subclavian artery, have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Pumping is initiated and controlled by the console using input from both the aortic pressure and the electrocardiogram. Inflation occurs immediately after aortic valve closure and deflation just before aortic valve opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83420\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef83420 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83948 \">figure 1</a>). Using software algorithms, current generation systems are capable of monitoring many aspects of both efficacy and safety, reducing the time required by health care personnel to directly supervise. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMODYNAMIC EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflation and deflation of the balloon has two major consequences:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood is displaced to the proximal aorta by inflation during diastole.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic volume (and thus afterload) is reduced during systole through a vacuum effect created by rapid balloon deflation.</p><p/><p>These effects may be quite variable, and they depend upon the volume of the balloon, its position in the aorta, heart rate, rhythm, the compliance of the aorta, and systemic resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The higher the arterial elastance, which is determined in part by compliance, the greater the hemodynamic improvement from intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation (IABP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Despite this variability, expected changes in the hemodynamic profile in the majority of patients with cardiogenic shock include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83421\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83421 \">figure 2</a>) :</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decrease in systolic pressure by 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in aortic diastolic pressure by 30 percent, which may raise coronary blood flow to territory perfused by a vessel with a critical stenosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in mean arterial pressure especially in patients with shock due to an acute mechanical abnormality such as mitral regurgitation (MR) or ventricular septal defect (VSD) or to improvement in perfusion of a territory resulting in overall improved ventricular function.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction of the heart rate by less than 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decrease in the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevation in the cardiac output by 20 percent, especially in patients with MR, VSD, or a large territory of medically refractory ischemia that is improved by the addition of counterpulsation</p><p/><p>In addition, intraaortic balloon pumping reduces mean systemic impedance and developed systolic pressure, and causes a 14 percent decline in calculated peak left ventricular wall stress. The reductions in afterload and wall stress lead to a fall in myocardial oxygen consumption, which is one of the goals of treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on coronary artery blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The IABP has a variable effect on total coronary blood flow. Some studies have found little or no change in coronary blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], while others noted a significant augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Increased blood flow is most likely to occur in coronary vascular beds maximally dilated by ischemia, a setting in which autoregulation is at a maximal level and flow becomes pressure-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As an example, autoregulation of the peripheral coronary bed tends to maintain flow across a stenotic area until the severity of the stenosis is sufficient to produce a distal perfusion pressure of 40 to 50 mmHg. At lower pressures, autoregulation is maximal and coronary flow to the territory affected by the stenosis cannot be maintained. Counterpulsation is able to enhance blood flow to these areas via an increase in perfusion pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consequent to the improvement in hemodynamic parameters described above, the intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation (IABP) may be an effective temporary therapeutic option in patients with significant hemodynamic compromise resulting from myocardial ischemia. </p><p>However, some patients with hemodynamic instability may require other percutaneous support due to IABP failure or as initial therapy. For example, an axial flow pump or a percutaneous left atrial-to-femoral arterial ventricular assist device may be appropriate for patients with low output states or shock when an IABP is deemed unlikely to provide adequate support.

Such recommendations have been based on the results of small, observational studies that were subject to selection bias and which were carried out before stenting and aggressive antiplatelet therapies were routine.</p><p>However, the elective placement of an IABP was not found to improve outcomes in the BCIS-1 trial in which 301 high-risk patients were randomly assigned to either elective insertion of IABP before PCI or not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. High risk was defined as severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction &le;30 percent; mean = 24 percent) and complex, multivessel coronary artery disease. Rescue placement of an IABP was allowed in the no planned IABP group for procedural complications of prolonged hypotension, pulmonary edema, or refractory ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p>There was no significant difference in the occurrence of the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (death, acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, or further revascularization) at 28 days (15.2 and 16.0 percent respectively; odds ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.51-1.76). Cross-over from no IABP to IABP placement occurred in 12 percent. However, after a median follow-up of 51 months, all-cause mortality was lower among those who received an IABP (28 versus 39 percent; hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.40-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The Kaplan-Meier curves appear to continue to diverge at five years. </p><p>Based on the results of BCIS-1, we suggest not routinely placing an IABP electively before PCI in high-risk (as defined in BCIS-1) patients.

A 2010 Cochrane systematic review of six randomized trials (five on-and one off-pump) of preoperative IABP placement concluded that IABP placement might be beneficial in high-risk patients based on the finding of a significantly lower rate of in-hospital death in patients treated with IABP compared to those not (odds ratio 0.18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The risk of complications increases with the duration of implantation.</p><p>When the etiology of hemodynamic compromise necessitating mechanical support is thought to be transient, periodic weaning trials can help determine optimal timing of IABP removal. In cases where the indication is not expected to reverse without a definitive intervention (eg, revascularization), the IABP can remain in place for as long as needed to bridge the patient to that definitive procedure. Meticulous care of the catheter, as well as close monitoring of distal circulation for vascular compromise, are necessary. When prolonged need for IABP support is expected (eg, &gt;10 to 14 days), insertion via axillary approach (preferably using graft conduit) should be considered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications associated with the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) may be divided into vascular and nonvascular events. In the above review of almost 17,000 patients who had an IABP inserted from 1996 to 2000, the incidence of any complication was 7 percent, while major complications (major acute limb ischemia, severe bleeding, balloon leak, death related directly to the IABP insertion or IABP failure) occurred in 2.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The in-hospital mortality was 21 percent, one-half of which occurred while the IABP was in place.

Neither of the branches is generally large enough to permit insertion without producing arterial obstruction and limb ischemia. Improper insertion from a needle puncture which is too low is the most common cause of ischemic complications during IABP, and will often require removal of the IABP and contralateral insertion.</p><p>Arterial dissection is most often due to improper advancement of the guidewire with subsequent insertion of the IABP into a false lumen. The balloon may function normally in this position. Dissection may be diagnosed by ultrasonography and requires immediate balloon removal.</p><p>Less common vascular complications, due to IABP compromise of perfusion, include spinal cord ischemia and visceral ischemia (including renal ischemia). In one study of 63 cardiac surgical patients who underwent IABP placement and who received both chest radiography and a computerized tomographic (CT) imaging study, the balloon was correctly positioned in only 62 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].
