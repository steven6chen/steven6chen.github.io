Weight loss in young infants is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-six-months-of-age-and-younger\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of weight loss in infants six months of age and younger&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4120467588\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many causes of weight loss throughout childhood. Dehydration, infection (especially viral gastroenteritis), malnutrition, and child neglect are common causes in older infants and young children. Depression, eating disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, and malabsorption (eg, lactose intolerance, celiac disease) are more frequent in school-age children and adolescents. Weight loss and slow weight gain can have serious long term consequences extending into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-over-six-months-of-age-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Assessments of the degree and acuity of the weight loss along with specific historical and physical findings should guide the evaluation of these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25288663\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss may be classified as intentional or unintentional:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute or progressive unintentional weight loss often indicates a serious medical illness that requires evaluation and treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intentional weight loss in overweight or obese individuals is benign in most instances but must be followed closely in the pediatric patient to insure the patient has appropriate growth. The frequency of intentional loss in association with altered body image or other psychiatric illness (eg, anorexia nervosa) increases with advancing age, peaking in adolescence and early adulthood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5454723\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major components of body weight consist of water, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Weight loss occurs when the intake of one or several of these components becomes less than the output. </p><p>Causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased calorie intake either voluntary (eg, eating disorder) or due to intercurrent illness with normal or increased metabolic expenditure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal calorie intake with increased metabolic utilization (eg, hyperthyroidism, excessive exercise)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal or increased calorie intake in the setting of malabsorption or excessive loss of nutrients (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, or self-induced losses [purging by vomiting, diuretics, or laxative use])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute fluid losses that exceed intake during acute illnesses, such as gastroenteritis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5454730\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for weight loss in the older infant, child, and adolescent is wide and may require an extensive work-up (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87727\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87727 \">table 1</a>). In many cases, a diagnosis is not revealed during initial care, but the evaluation may begin and specialist referrals can be made as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5454737\"><span class=\"h2\">Life threatening conditions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5454745\"><span class=\"h3\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with new onset diabetes mellitus may present with significant weight loss in the setting of polyuria and polydipsia over days to weeks. Laboratory studies show hyperglycemia and glycosuria. Weight loss is a result of hypovolemia (due to a hyperglycemia-induced osmotic diuresis) and increased catabolism. Insulin deficiency impairs glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and increases fat and muscle breakdown. Initially appetite is increased, but over time, children may become anorexic, contributing to weight loss. Patients may also present with significant illness due to diabetic ketoacidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Classic new onset'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5454752\"><span class=\"h3\">Adrenal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with adrenal insufficiency may present with excessive fluid losses and hemodynamic instability due to a deficiency of corticosteroid production which leads to altered fluid and salt balance. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) occurs when the adrenal gland itself is dysfunctional while secondary or tertiary (central) adrenal insufficiency occurs when there is a lack of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus , respectively, that leads to inadequate adrenal function (eg, hypopituitarism, diencephalic syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Primary versus central adrenal insufficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Patients suffering from adrenal insufficiency present with vomiting, anorexia, dehydration, and weight loss which can lead to cardiovascular collapse. Physical findings may include hyperpigmentation, especially on the extensor surfaces, and weakness. Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis are classic laboratory findings in the initial assessment. Stabilization involves management of airway, breathing and circulation with a focus on volume resuscitation and corticosteroid replacement. Whenever possible, measurement of serum cortisol should precede corticosteroid administration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of central adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5454766\"><span class=\"h3\">Eating disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with anorexia nervosa typically present with a refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height defined as either 85 percent of that expected for age and height or a body mass index (BMI) &le;17.5 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-percentiles-for-girls-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-percentiles-for-boys-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). Additional features include an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat despite being underweight, distorted perception of body weight and shape, and, in postmenarchal females, amenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75110 \">table 2</a>). Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain, occurring on average at least two times per week for three months. Other clinical features options of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are discussed separately. In severe eating disorders, patients may develop profound bradycardia or electrolytes abnormalities that are life threatening.

Children with acute gastroenteritis typically present with acute onset of diarrhea, vomiting, fever, anorexia, and abdominal cramps. Blood or mucous in the stool or rice water stool suggest bacterial enteritis or cholera, respectively. Findings of significant dehydration (eg, prolonged capillary refill, dry mucous membranes, lethargy) are commonly found on physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Repletion of fluid losses and management of gastroenteritis are discussed in more detail separately.

Clinical manifestations include nonbloody watery diarrhea, nonbilious vomiting, variable fever, abdominal pain, and anorexia. The diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis is made clinically. Testing for specific viruses usually is not necessary in immunocompetent hosts with routine gastroenteritis. However, it may be indicated during outbreaks of gastroenteritis, to make decisions about specific therapy, and for cohorting and isolation of hospitalized patients. Most previously healthy patients recover uneventfully but severe dehydration may rarely occur. (See <a href=\"#H4101546\" class=\"local\">'Dehydration'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H521299938\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12161442\"><span class=\"h3\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic weight loss may be a neurovegetative sign of depression, especially in adolescents. Other findings may include decreased appetite, change in sleep, and lack of energy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70852 \">table 3</a>). Problems with school work, drug use, and risky sexual behaviors are additional comorbidities. Recognition of depression can be difficult due to nonspecific complaints and symptoms. In addition to neurovegetative signs described above, depressed school-age children may also present with irritability, generalized body pains, sleep disturbances, headaches, and poor oral intake with associated weight loss. Additional features suggesting depression in older children or adolescents include chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus or cancer), a family history of depression in siblings or a parent, and situational stressors. Diagnosis should be based upon a formal clinical interview with the patient that is supplemented by information from parents and, in the primary care setting, from teachers. All patients with signs of depression warrant screening for suicidal ideation.

UC affects the colon, whereas CD can involve any component of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the oral cavity to the anus. The peak incidence of IBD occurs in patients between the ages of 15 and 25 years. Approximately 25 to 30 percent of patients with CD and 20 percent of patients with UC present before the age of 20 years. Adolescents and children with IBD may present with oral lesions (eg, mucogingivitis or deep ulcerations), abdominal pain, weight loss, tenesmus, perianal fistulas or skin tags, diarrhea, and hematochezia. Growth failure and delayed puberty are present in about 30 percent of children and is due to a combination of anorexia and increased energy needs related to inflammation.

Fever is frequently present along with other clinical findings that provide clues to the source of infection (eg, cough and respiratory distress [pneumonia], suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness [urinary tract infection], sore throat with tonsillar exudate or swelling [streptococcal pharyngitis, peritonsillar abscess]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-over-six-months-of-age-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5454809\"><span class=\"h3\">Celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Celiac disease is a multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals.<sup> </sup>It is triggered by a well-identified environmental factor (gluten and related prolamins). The disease primarily affects the small intestine, where it progressively leads to flattening of the small intestinal mucosa. Three cereals contain gluten and are toxic for patients with celiac disease: wheat, rye, and barley. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The typical form of celiac disease presents with GI symptoms that characteristically appear at age 9 to 24 months. Infants and young children typically present with chronic diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, poor weight gain or weight loss, and vomiting after the introduction of gluten-containing foods. Severe malnutrition can occur if the diagnosis is delayed. Behavioral changes are common and include irritability and an introverted attitude. Rarely, severely affected infants present with a celiac crisis, which is characterized by explosive watery diarrhea, marked abdominal distension, dehydration, hypotension, and lethargy, often with profound electrolyte abnormalities, including severe hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5454816\"><span class=\"h3\">Child neglect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Child neglect is the most prevalent form of child abuse, accounting for more than one-half of cases reported to child protection services. It is defined by the National Center of Child Abuse and Neglect as failure to provide for a child's basic physical, emotional, educational, or medical needs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child neglect and emotional maltreatment&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The manifestations of child neglect include starvation or dehydration due to inadequate provision of food and water; poor hygiene of a child's body; severe, untreated dental caries; failure to provide routine health care including immunizations, and physical abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-over-six-months-of-age-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Many but not all children will have physical signs of abuse including fractures and bruises. Often children also suffer from ongoing emotional abuse in conjunction with physical abuse or neglect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child neglect and emotional maltreatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5454823\"><span class=\"h3\">Malnutrition and failure to thrive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inadequate access to food affects a large number of children, especially in the developing world. Severe protein-energy malnutrition is associated with one of two classical syndromes, marasmus (wasting syndrome) and kwashiorkor, or with manifestations of both. Each type of protein-energy malnutrition may be classified as acute or chronic, depending upon the duration of nutritional deprivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-over-six-months-of-age-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Children with acute malnutrition appear wasted, whereas children with chronic malnutrition have stunted linear growth. A detailed social history can often reveal poverty and economic stressors as potential contributors to weight loss from lack of resources. Patients may present with weight loss or poor weight gain because of decreased intake due to the inability to acquire adequate amounts of nutrition and chronic conditions that are due to poor food availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-over-six-months-of-age-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Often, patients have no reliable housing, schooling, and other social support issues that need to be addressed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries: Clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Failure to thrive (FTT) is a sign that describes a particular problem, rather than a diagnosis. The term FTT is used to describe instances of growth failure, or more specifically, failure to gain weight appropriately, especially in children three years of age and younger. In more severe cases, linear growth and head circumference also may be affected. A wide variety of medical problems and psychosocial stressors can contribute to FTT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69846\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69846 \">table 4</a>). However, the underlying cause is always related to inadequate nutrition. Several definitions of failure to thrive exist. All definitions identify children with failure to thrive as having low weight in relation to age or length <strong>or </strong>insufficient weight gain over time.

Characteristics symptoms after the ingestion of lactose include abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and, particularly in adolescents, vomiting. The abdominal pain may be crampy in nature and is often localized to the periumbilical area or lower quadrant. Borborygmi may be audible on physical examination and to the patient. The stools are usually bulky, frothy, and watery. Undiagnosed patients who continue with lactose intake may have significant weight loss. Lactose malabsorption should be confirmed by a test of absorption (eg, lactose absorption test) or malabsorption (lactose breath hydrogen test). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2086096\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anorexia with weight loss may accompany use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a> and other amphetamines for the treatment of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity. Administering the medicine at or after a meal, encouraging the ingestion of nutrient dense foods, and offering foods that the child likes for lunch (the meal most likely to be affected) may overcome decreased appetite. If stimulant therapy is associated with growth failure that crosses two major percentiles (ie, the 5<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, 75<sup>th</sup>, 90<sup>th</sup>, and 95<sup>th</sup>), then a drug holiday may be beneficial as long as marked impairment in psychological functioning does not occur.

Although childhood cancers are rare events, they are the fourth leading cause of death in individuals between 1 and 19 years of age in the United States after unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide. Common sites include blood and bone marrow, brain, bone, lymph nodes, nervous system, kidneys, and soft tissues. A thorough physical examination may reveal additional worrisome findings, such as lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly that constitute need for further evaluation.

Patients may present with recurrent unexplained infections leading to gradual weight loss. Furthermore, loss of lean body mass or wasting is a well-recognized AIDS-defining condition for children and adolescents. HIV infection, opportunistic infections, and increased metabolic demands all can lead to loss of weight and lean body mass. In children, wasting can severely impact normal growth and development and is associated with a high risk for HIV disease progression and short-term mortality.

This is particularly true in the presence of oral ulcers, candidiasis, or chronic diarrhea. Almost three-fourths of the primary immunodeficiencies are caused by an antibody (B cell) deficiency or a combined antibody plus cellular (T cell) abnormality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80845\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80845 \">figure 1</a>). Isolated T cell defects, as well as phagocytic cell, complement, and other innate immune defects, are much less common. Thus, B cell (antibody) or combined B and T cell diseases should be considered initially, unless clinical features suggest otherwise. Recurrent infections comprise the most common clinical findings. The type and pattern of recurring infections depend on which components of the immune system are affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74045 \">table 6</a>). Infection severity also varies, ranging from mild respiratory infections to overwhelming systemic infections.

Acute disease is notable for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, malaise, and flatulence. Chronic disease is marked by waxing and waning findings that include steatorrhea, malaise, fatigue, abdominal pain, flatulence, and burping. Patients with chronic giardiasis can lose up to 10 to 20 percent of their body weight. Stool microscopy is the initial diagnostic test of choice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children with a large burden of intestinal parasites other than Giardia may have weight loss and failure to thrive due to poor absorption of nutrients.

In children, SMA syndrome is associated with spinal surgery and is also more common in intellectually disabled patients who commonly present with intolerance of gastrostomy tube feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-over-six-months-of-age-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients typically present with postprandial epigastric abdominal pain and early satiety, while those with more advanced obstruction may have severe nausea, bilious emesis and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-over-six-months-of-age-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Physical examination findings are often nonspecific but may include abdominal distension, a succussion splash, and high-pitched bowel sounds. Laboratory examination can be normal or, in patients with severe vomiting, significant electrolyte abnormalities may be present. Upper gastrointestinal fluoroscopy with small bowel follow through is diagnostic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=superior-mesenteric-artery-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Superior mesenteric artery syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cystic fibrosis</strong> &ndash; Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a complex chloride channel and regulatory protein found in all exocrine tissues. Deranged transport of chloride <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other CFTR-affected ions, such as sodium and bicarbonate, leads to thick, viscous secretions in the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive tract, and to increased salt content in sweat gland secretions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Overview of clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although screening for CF is performed in many resource-rich countries and most children otherwise present with signs or symptoms as infants, rarely older children and adolescents with intermediate derangements in CFTR may come to attention because of weight loss in association with frequent pneumonias, chronic cough, sinus disease, or pancreatic insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Overview of clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cyclic vomiting</strong> &ndash; Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is an idiopathic disorder characterized by three or more recurrent discrete episodes of vomiting with varying intervals of completely normal health between episodes. Patients have no organic cause to their recurrent vomiting. The specific pattern of vomiting episodes is variable among patients but, importantly, is stereotypical for an individual patient. In general, CVS episodes tend to begin in the early morning hours (2:00 to 7:00 AM) and may involve a prodromal period of pallor, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lethargy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62483\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62483 \">table 7</a>). In children, the attacks last an average of 24 to 48 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclic-vomiting-syndrome#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclic vomiting syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Supportive criteria for the diagnosis of CVS include a history or family history of migraine headaches, the self-limited nature of the attacks, associated symptoms of nausea, abdominal pain, headache, motion sickness, photophobia, and lethargy, and associated signs of fever, pallor, diarrhea, dehydration, excess salivation, and social withdrawal. In children, nausea and possibly lethargy are considered to be key diagnostic features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclic-vomiting-syndrome#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclic vomiting syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pancreatitis</strong> &ndash; Chronic pancreatitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with growth failure, particularly those with a weight deficit and malnutrition. Abdominal pain is the cardinal feature of chronic pancreatitis. However, the pain pattern varies among patients and tends to fluctuate during the course of the disease. The pain typically is epigastric, often radiates to the back, is often associated with nausea and vomiting, and may be relieved by sitting upright or leaning forward. The pain often is worse 15 to 30 minutes after eating, especially if fatty food is consumed. Early in the course of chronic pancreatitis, the pain may occur in discrete attacks; as the condition progresses, the pain tends to become more continuous. Findings of malabsorption (steatorrhea) and glucose intolerance (glycosuria, frank diabetes mellitus) may also be present. The examination is often normal, but may include epigastric or upper abdominal tenderness. An epigastric mass may be palpated if the patient has developed a pseudocyst. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is relatively straightforward and can be suspected clinically in patients who present with acute pancreatitis followed by recurring attacks of pain. Diagnosis is more challenging in those with few or mild symptoms. In such patients, the diagnosis depends upon the strength of clinical features, combined with functional and morphologic evaluation of the pancreas, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver disease</strong> &ndash; Hepatic insufficiency with jaundice, anorexia, weakness, and malabsorption of fat may lead to weight loss in children. Right upper quadrant abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and encephalopathy are frequently present. Viral and drug-induced hepatitis, immune dysregulation, and rarely, Wilson disease comprise potential etiologies.

Associated findings include fever, characteristic rash (butterfly malar or evanescent macular papular rash), arthralgia or arthritis, elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein), leukocytosis, and anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperthyroidism</strong> &ndash; Hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents has unique effects on growth and development. Children will often have delayed growth plate closure with a subsequent increase in growth rate. This leads children to cross growth percentiles upwards for height in the setting of a significant weight loss. Other clinical features include lid lag and stare, diffuse goiter, tachycardia, increased gastrointestinal motility, proximal muscle weakness, tremor, hyper-reflexia, sleep disturbance, and distractibility. Diagnosis is made by measurement of serum thyroid function tests.

Presenting symptoms include pulmonary findings (cough, dyspnea, chest pain) and systemic symptoms of fever, anorexia, fatigue, and weight loss. Sarcoidosis has a myriad of extrapulmonary manifestations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76046\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76046 \">table 8</a>). Diagnosis is supported by compatible clinical findings and radiographic features, exclusion of other diseases with similar presentation (eg, tuberculosis, lymphoma), and histopathology showing noncaseating granulomas in the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67837 \">picture 1</a>).
