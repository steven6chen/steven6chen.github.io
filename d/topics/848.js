This fusion oncogene rearrangement is transforming both in vitro and in vivo and defines a distinct clinicopathologic subset of NSCLC. It is found in approximately 5 percent of NSCLCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Tumors that contain the <em>EML4-ALK</em> fusion oncogene or its variants are associated with specific clinical features, including never or light smoking history, younger age, and adenocarcinoma with signet ring or acinar histology. <em>ALK</em> gene arrangements are largely mutually exclusive with epidermal growth factor receptor (<em>EGFR</em>) and <em>KRAS</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

We also obtain molecular testing in never-smokers with advanced lung cancer and nonadenocarcinoma histology. <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangements or the resulting fusion proteins may be detected in tumor specimens using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of cDNA (RT-PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the United States, FISH and IHC are approved companion diagnostic tests to identify <em>ALK</em>-positive NSCLC. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is also effective at detecting <em>ALK</em> rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but is not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The commercial break-apart probes include two differently colored (red and green) probes that flank the highly conserved translocation breakpoint within <em>ALK</em>. In non-rearranged cells, the overlying red and green probes result in a yellow (fused) signal; in the setting of an <em>ALK</em> rearrangement, these probes are separated, and splitting of the red and green signals is observed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80903%7EONC%2F90750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80903 graphicRef90750 \">picture 1A-B</a>).

Thus, IHC is an appropriate method to screen for and identify the presence of <em>ALK</em> positivity, and the Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx assay has been approved for use in the United States by the FDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RT-PCR of cDNA has been a commonly used screening strategy for detecting <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangements in NSCLC, but is no longer recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A number of multiplex assays were developed to simultaneously capture all possible in-frame fusions between <em>EML4</em> and <em>ALK</em> in which the kinase domain of ALK would be preserved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. While different breakpoints in <em>EML4</em> or <em>ALK</em> may be detected, novel ALK fusion partners will not. Furthermore, this method is frequently limited by the quality of the RNA that can be isolated from archival tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICOPATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With increasing identification of this molecular abnormality, the key epidemiologic, demographic, and pathologic features associated with <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogenes have been identified.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> &ndash; In unselected NSCLC populations, the <em>ALK</em> rearrangement is a relatively rare event, on the order of about 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7-9,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,13-17</a>]. Except in rare cases, the presence of <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangements in NSCLC tumors tends to occur independent of epidermal growth factor receptor (<em>EGFR</em>) or <em>KRAS</em> mutations. Similar frequencies of <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangements have been reported in Asian and Western populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p>While the overall frequency of <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene in the general NSCLC population is low, knowledge of the clinicopathologic features enables enrichment for this genetically defined subset. In one study in which patients were selected for genetic screening based on clinical features commonly associated with <em>EGFR</em> mutation, including <span class=\"nowrap\">never/light</span> smoking status and adenocarcinoma histology, 13 percent harbored the <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene. Within the group of never or light smokers in this study, the frequency of <em>ALK</em> positivity was 22 percent, and among never or light smokers who did not have an <em>EGFR</em> mutation, the frequency was 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These findings suggest that in NSCLC patients with clinical characteristics associated with <em>EGFR</em> mutation but with negative <em>EGFR</em> testing, as many as one in three may harbor the <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene.

The two studies that were used to support the approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crizotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">crizotinib</a> included 255 patients whose tumors contained an <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene; in this database, the median age was 52 years (range, 21 to 82 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The estimated median age for unselected patients with lung cancer is approximately 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>Interestingly, other cancers known to harbor <em>ALK</em> rearrangements such as <em>NPM-ALK</em>-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma are also associated with younger age and are, in fact, most common in children and young adults.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smoking history</strong> &ndash; The <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene in patients with NSCLC is strongly associated with a history of never or light smoking (&lt;10 pack-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1,8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,19</a>]. In the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crizotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">crizotinib</a> study database of 255 patients, never smokers and former smokers comprised 70 and 28 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1,8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Histology</strong> &ndash; The vast majority of lung tumors that harbor the <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene are adenocarcinomas. In the 255 patients with the <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene included in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crizotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">crizotinib</a> database, 97 percent were adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. <em>ALK</em> rearrangement has been reported in squamous cell carcinoma, but this is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17</a>]. </p><p/><p>Adenocarcinomas in <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene-positive cases from Caucasian patients are significantly more likely to have abundant signet ring cells than those with an <em>EGFR</em> mutation or wild type tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Signet ring cells are frequently found in gastric cancers and rarely in cancers of other organs such as the lung. Several small case series suggest that signet ring cells may be associated with an aggressive clinical course and a poor prognosis. Whether the presence of signet ring cells in <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene-positive lung cancer has biologic or clinical significance remains to be determined.</p><p>Other studies of <em>ALK</em> in NSCLC have not reported an association with signet ring cells, but have noted a possible association with the acinar subtype of adenocarcinoma, at least in Asian patients. This discrepancy may reflect differences in pathologic interpretation rather than ethnic differences in patients with <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene-positive lung cancer. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3317358999\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3298397401\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale for ALK inhibitors over chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced NSCLC associated with the <em>ALK</em> fusion oncogene is highly sensitive to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Treatment with ALK TKIs should be limited to patients whose tumors contain this abnormality as demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients should have tumor tissue assessed not only for the presence of <em>ALK</em> rearrangement, but also for other driver mutations (especially in the epidermal growth factor receptor [<em>EGFR</em>]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H9880670\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Molecular testing'</a>.)</p><p>An ALK inhibitor is preferred as the initial therapy for patients whose tumor contains this genetic abnormality in countries where it is approved for this indication. Results of a phase III trial comparing ALK inhibition using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crizotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">crizotinib</a> with chemotherapy in treatment-na&iuml;ve patients have demonstrated a prolongation in progression-free survival (PFS) and improved response rate and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. No significant differences in overall survival were seen, potentially due to the confounding effects of crossover. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Crizotinib'</a> below.)</p><p>If urgent systemic treatment is required before the results of genotype testing are available, systemic chemotherapy rather than targeted therapy is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. When the results of genotype testing become available, the treatment plan should be reassessed. There are no clinical trials that directly address the optimal timing of ALK inhibitors in patients who have already started on chemotherapy. For such patients, we prefer to switch to an ALK inhibitor when genotyping results identify <em>ALK</em>-positive disease. However, others may reasonably opt to continue chemotherapy in the absence of evidence of progression and use an ALK inhibitor as maintenance therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3811658068\"><span class=\"h2\">Preferred first-line targeted therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the available clinical data, including the global ALEX study, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alectinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alectinib</a> for front-line therapy for those with newly diagnosed, <em>ALK</em>-positive NSCLC.
