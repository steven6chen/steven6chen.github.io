There are numerous causes of hemolytic anemia, including inherited and acquired conditions, acute and chronic processes, and mild to potentially life-threatening severity. Occasionally the cause will be obvious from the history, physical examination, or findings on the peripheral blood smear, but often the ultimate diagnosis requires a synthesis of all of this information and additional laboratory testing. </p><p>The key finding that suggests hemolytic anemia is an increase in the reticulocyte count that is not explained by recent bleeding or recent correction of iron deficiency or other nutrient deficiency. Patients may also have evidence of RBC destruction including increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, and spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear.</p><p>The causes of hemolytic anemia and a diagnostic approach to the adult with unexplained hemolytic anemia are discussed here.

During this time, RBCs are subjected to a remarkable amount of mechanical stress as they traverse capillaries and splenic cords much smaller than their diameter, which requires repeated cycles of deformation and elastic recoil. This happens many millions of times over the course of the RBC lifespan.</p><p>The properties of the RBC that allow it to withstand this stress include a highly deformable membrane and underlying cytoskeleton, an optimal surface-to-volume ratio, and an enzymatic system that continually restores the proper redox environment of the cell. The optimal membrane surface is approximately 40 percent greater than that of a perfectly spherical cell of equivalent volume. RBC volume is regulated by ion pumps and channels that control the entry of water and cations including cations sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Metabolic enzymes generate ATP needed by the cation pumps; 2,3-BPG, which regulates oxygen uptake and release by hemoglobin; and reducing capacity (eg, glutathione, NADPH), to protect the oxygen-rich RBC from oxidant injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Normal aging of RBCs results in age-dependent RBC destruction, referred to as random hemolysis. This typically occurs at a rate of approximately 1 percent of RBCs daily. The percentage of RBCs that are cleared from the circulation can be increased dramatically in hemolytic states, especially when an enlarged spleen is contributing to hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell survival: Normal values and measurement&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemolysis occurs when the RBC is unable to maintain its intact structure during passages through the circulation and reticuloendothelial system. Hemolysis by any mechanism stimulates a compensatory increase in RBC production via increased erythropoietin (EPO) secretion by the kidney. EPO in turn stimulates the bone marrow to produce more RBC precursors, which is followed within a few days by an increase in the reticulocyte count and within an additional one to two days by an increase in the hemoglobin level and hematocrit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-erythropoiesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of erythropoiesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'The red blood cell life cycle'</a>.)</p><p>The occurrence of anemia and its severity is determined by the balance between the extent of hemolysis and the capacity of the bone marrow to amplify RBC production. This balance is illustrated in the following calculations and clinical examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RBC survival and turnover rate can be calculated under steady state conditions (eg, when the secretion and response to EPO are intact) from the percentage of reticulocytes and the reticulocyte lifespan (RLS). The RLS increases proportionally as the hematocrit decreases and reticulocytes enter the circulation at progressively earlier stages in their maturation (when the hematocrit is lower, reticulocytes are released earlier from the bone marrow). In the steady state without anemia the typical RLS is approximately one day, after which the cell becomes a mature RBC. In severe anemia, reticulocytes can be released from the bone marrow as much as 1.5 days early (&quot;shift cells&quot;), giving a RLS of 2.5 days.</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>RBC survival</strong> &ndash; RBC survival (days) &asymp; 100 &#160;&divide; &#160;[Reticulocytes (percent) &#160;&divide; &#160;RLS (days)]</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The RLS is 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 days at hematocrits of 45, 35, 25, and 15 percent, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61552\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61552 \">figure 1</a>). For an individual without hemolysis who has a hematocrit of 40 and a reticulocyte count of 1 percent, RBC survival is calculated to be approximately 100 days (100 &divide; [1 &divide; 1] = 100). Corrections for the increased RLS can be made in patients with severe anemia to reflect the degree of reticulocytosis more accurately. (See <a href=\"#H3882494893\" class=\"local\">'High reticulocyte count'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>RBC turnover</strong> &ndash; The rate of RBC turnover is the reciprocal of RBC survival:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">RBC turnover rate <span class=\"nowrap\">(percent/day)</span> &#160;= &#160;100 &#160;&divide; &#160;RBC survival (days)</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In adults, the normal rate of RBC turnover is approximately 1 percent per day, and the maximal sustainable capacity of the bone marrow to increase RBC production in an adult is approximately 5 percent per day (ie, approximately five times normal). In children, the bone marrow capacity can increase RBC production up to eight times normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an adult with sickle cell anemia who has a hematocrit of 26 percent and a reticulocyte count of 15 percent, the estimated RBC survival is 13 days (100 &divide; [15 &divide; 2]), and the rate of RBC turnover is 7.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/day</span> (100 &divide; 13 = 7.7 percent). This turnover rate exceeds the capacity of the individual's bone marrow to correct the anemia completely, which is why the hematocrit is only 26 percent. Stated another way, the individual's bone marrow can only deliver 65 percent of the needed RBCs (5 &divide; 7.7 = 0.65); 65 percent of the normal hematocrit of 40 percent gives a hematocrit of 26 percent. Further, if this individual were to develop transient bone marrow aplasia (eg, due to parvovirus infection), then the hematocrit would fall by approximately 7.7 percent per day. After seven days, the hematocrit will have fallen by approximately half to give a hematocrit of 13 percent, with severe clinical consequences. In contrast, if an individual without ongoing hemolysis were to develop parvovirus infection and have seven days of bone marrow aplasia, the hematocrit would only decrease by 7 percent, which is likely to be clinically silent.</p><p/><p>Reticulocytosis requires adequate iron and vitamins (B12, folate) for RBC production, along with a normally-functioning bone marrow and adequate erythropoietin production. Thus, individuals who are deficient in iron, vitamin B12, or folate; those with concomitant bone marrow abnormalities (eg, from infection or primary bone marrow disorders); and those with inadequate erythropoietin production (eg, from chronic kidney disease) may not have reticulocytosis.

The site of hemolysis influences the results of certain diagnostic tests and often determines the clinical severity and immediate management needs of the patient. This is because the site of RBC destruction determines whether the byproducts of RBC destruction such as free hemoglobin will be routed through the reticuloendothelial system or will be liberated directly into the circulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If products of hemolysis are liberated into the circulation, they will appear as free serum hemoglobin or heme and urinary hemoglobin, heme, or hemosiderin.

As an example, RBC destruction in AIHA is generally extravascular, as reticuloendothelial macrophages progressively phagocytize small pieces of RBC membrane that are opsonized with autoantibodies. In contrast, in hemolysis from mechanical trauma (eg, prosthetic heart valve, marching, bongo drums), the lysis can be immediate and complete within the circulation, before the RBCs reach the reticuloendothelial system. Likewise, in conditions in which the membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement creates a hole in the RBC membrane (eg, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH], paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria [PCH]), a large component of intravascular hemolysis is likely.</p><p>However, in many cases there is a component of both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis, especially when hemolysis is severe. The site of RBC destruction thus is helpful in determining the cause of hemolysis and the need for more aggressive therapy but typically is not diagnostic of a specific condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2897147055\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravascular hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravascular hemolysis refers to hemolysis that occurs primarily within the vasculature. This occurs when there is a considerable amount of structural damage to the RBC membrane (eg, mechanical shearing, complement MAC) or when the reticuloendothelial system becomes overwhelmed. When severe, intravascular hemolysis is characterized by pink or brown serum and dark urine with free serum and urine hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The pink color is due to oxyhemoglobin and the brownish color is due to the oxidized form, methemoglobin. Free hemoglobin binds to haptoglobin, and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is rapidly removed by the liver, leading to a reduction in plasma haptoglobin, often to undetectable levels (see <a href=\"#H2471933277\" class=\"local\">'High LDH and bilirubin; low haptoglobin'</a> below). Dimers of alpha-beta globin that are not bound by haptoglobin are small enough (molecular weight 34,000 daltons) to be filtered by the glomerulus and appear in the urine as hemoglobinuria.</p><p>Urine hemosiderin may be seen several days after an episode of intravascular hemolysis, as renal tubular cells take up the heme, degrade it, store it as hemosiderin, and eventually are shed into the urine.

Severely damaged RBCs, especially those coated with complement, are primarily destroyed in the liver, an organ that receives a larger proportion of the cardiac output than the spleen. Poorly deformable RBCs such as spherocytes or sickled cells are primarily destroyed in the spleen, in the cords of Billroth. These unique vascular channels end blindly, unlike other vascular channels in the body. The only way for a RBC with a diameter of 7 to 8 microns to escape from these cords and return to the general circulation is to deform sufficiently to pass through 2 to 3 micron slits in the walls of the cords (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53105 \">picture 2</a>). Senescent or damaged RBCs remain in the cords and are phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages.</p><p>RBCs destroyed in the spleen are usually phagocytosed in their entirety and digested within phagosomes of macrophages. Most of the hemoglobin is degraded to release heme, with each molecule of heme converted to equimolar amounts of biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide via the action of microsomal heme oxygenase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The biliverdin is immediately reduced to unconjugated bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase and is released into the plasma.

Other patients may have more than one cause of anemia, one of which may blunt the normal reticulocyte response to hemolysis. (See <a href=\"#H4004364487\" class=\"local\">'RBC turnover in hemolytic anemia'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is suspected in a patient with chronic or new onset symptoms of anemia (eg, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath), a low hemoglobin level, and an increased reticulocyte count that is not explained by accelerated RBC production due to recent bleeding; repletion of iron, vitamin B12, folate, or copper; or administration of erythropoietin. Additional laboratory testing is often used to confirm the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and to determine the likely cause. Testing to confirm hemolysis may be done simultaneously with testing to determine the cause, or sequentially. In some cases, testing to confirm hemolysis may be omitted if specific testing to determine the cause of hemolysis is rapidly available and likely to be definitive. (See <a href=\"#H154425084\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory confirmation of hemolysis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1095359486\" class=\"local\">'Testing to determine the cause of hemolysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients with especially severe anemia or other worrisome findings may require immediate life-saving interventions before hemolysis has been diagnosed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the cause identified. Importantly, life-saving interventions such as transfusion for severe anemia; plasmapheresis for possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP); or vigorous hydration and diuresis for an acute transfusion reaction should not be withheld while confirming the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1419368063\" class=\"local\">'Immediate management issues before the cause is identified'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is relatively certain, our approach to determining the cause and providing immediate interventions is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108335\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108335 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain a thorough history and physical examination targeted to potential causes of hemolysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly identify and triage individuals with potentially life-threatening conditions that require urgent involvement of a specialist (often a hematologist or transfusion medicine physician), such as a thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or an acute transfusion reaction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has a clear history of life-long anemia or classic findings on the peripheral blood smear that suggest one of the hereditary hemolytic anemias due to hemoglobinopathy, metabolic defect, or membrane defect, pursue specific testing for the likely condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For other patients, obtain a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) to determine whether the anemia is immune or non-immune.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the DAT is positive, immune hemolysis is the likely diagnosis.

Hemolysis may also be the first sign of an underlying systemic disorder (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and may require an urgent intervention to prevent death or disease-related complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158211331\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic approach, starting with a thorough history and physical examination is the cornerstone of the evaluation.

(See <a href=\"#H1095359486\" class=\"local\">'Testing to determine the cause of hemolysis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2264173373\"><span class=\"h3\">CBC/blood smear review</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients for whom the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is considered will have had a complete blood count. In the majority of cases, this will include a white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count, and RBC indices. Hemolysis will be associated with some degree of anemia in the majority of cases, especially when it first occurs, when there is a delay in the production of new RBCs to compensate for hemolysis, and, if it is severe, when the bone marrow cannot fully compensate. (See <a href=\"#H4004364487\" class=\"local\">'RBC turnover in hemolytic anemia'</a> above.) </p><p>In most types of hemolytic anemia, the other blood cell counts (WBC and platelet count) will be normal. An abnormally high or low WBC suggests infection or hematologic malignancy. Sepsis can associated with hemolysis due to direct RBC lysis (eg, in clostridial sepsis, malaria, bartonellosis, or babesiosis) or DIC. Hematologic malignancies classically associated with hemolysis include chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with autoimmune hemolysis and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with DIC. </p><p>In most cases of hemolytic anemia, there will be some degree of macrocytosis, as reticulocytes are larger than normal RBCs. However, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) may be low, normal, or high depending on the degree of reticulocytosis and the presence of spherocytes or other abnormal RBC shapes, as spherocytes have a low MCV that may lower the average cell volume into the normal or even the low range. </p><p>Review of the peripheral blood smear is an extremely valuable tool for determining the presence and cause of hemolytic anemia. In many cases, findings on the blood smear are essential to providing life-saving treatment. Examples include thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or drug-induced TMA (DITMA); infections such as malaria or Babesia; and Heinz bodies or bite cells suggests hemolysis due to an oxidant drug in a patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.</p><p>An initial evaluation for the cause of anemia may have already occurred in some individuals for whom the likelihood of hemolysis was thought to be low or for whom hemolysis was not considered initially. The discussion herein presumes that other common causes of anemia have been evaluated or excluded based on the clinical history, examination, or laboratory testing.

Increased reticulocytes is a typical finding in hemolytic anemia but is not specific for hemolysis; the bone marrow can also increase RBC production in response to bleeding, nutrient repletion (eg, vitamin B12, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, iron), or erythropoietin administration. The absence of reticulocytosis does not eliminate the possibility of hemolysis, as some individuals have concomitant bone marrow suppression or reduced bone marrow function that interferes with production of reticulocytes. (See <a href=\"#H2782676094\" class=\"local\">'Hemolysis without reticulocytosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The degree of reticulocytosis can be estimated from the peripheral blood smear, as reticulocytes are larger than mature RBCs, lack central pallor, and have a bluish tint (polychromasia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67042\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67042 \">picture 3</a>). The count can be quantified from a manual count on a peripheral blood smear stained for reticulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74294\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74294 \">picture 4</a>) or by an automated counter. Some counters automatically provide the reticulocyte count.

In cases of markedly increased reticulocytosis or failure of the bone marrow to produce reticulocytes, any of these measures is likely to be a relatively good indicator of the degree of reticulocytosis. However, the corrections make the count more accurate, and in some cases are essential to determining whether reticulocytosis is truly increased: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reticulocyte percentage</strong> &ndash; The reticulocyte percentage conveys the percentage of all RBCs that are reticulocytes. Since it is relative to the total RBC count, it may be artificially increased in severe anemia and artificially decreased if the patient is not anemic. The normal reticulocyte percentage in a patient without hemolysis is in the range of 1 to 2 percent. In patients with hemolysis and an otherwise intact bone marrow, reticulocyte percentage is at least 4 to 5 percent, and often considerably higher. This was illustrated in a series of 109 individuals with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, in which the median reticulocyte percentage at diagnosis was 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Thus, the reticulocyte percentage can be multiplied by the patient's hematocrit divided by a normal hematocrit (eg, 45 percent) to give a corrected reticulocyte percentage. As an example, if reticulocytes are 10 percent in a patient with a hematocrit of 22.5 percent, the corrected count can be obtained by multiplying 10 percent x (22.5 percent &divide; 45 percent) = 10 percent x 0.5 = 5 percent.</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absolute reticulocyte count </strong>&ndash; The absolute reticulocyte count has the advantage of accurately reflecting the degree of reticulocytosis regardless of the degree of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

An example of the utility of this measure is a severely anemic patient with a hematocrit of 18 percent, a RBC count of <span class=\"nowrap\">2,000,000/microL,</span> and reticulocyte count of 3 percent.

The RLS is 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 days at hematocrits of 45, 35, 25, and 15 percent, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61552\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61552 \">figure 1</a>).

Hemolysis releases lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and hemoglobin from RBCs. Hemoglobin is bound by circulating haptoglobin, which facilitates heme recycling; hemoglobin is converted to bilirubin as part of the degradation and heme recycling process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65197\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65197 \">figure 2</a>). Thus, high LDH and bilirubin and low haptoglobin are all consistent with hemolysis. However, there are several caveats:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>LDH and bilirubin</strong> &ndash; High LDH and bilirubin are not very specific for hemolysis, as there are numerous other possible causes of these abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F98392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98392 \">table 3</a>). When bilirubin elevation is due to hemolysis, the elevation is predominantly in the indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Haptoglobin</strong> &ndash; The normal range for serum haptoglobin is wide. A low haptoglobin is likely to be due to hemolysis, and an undetectable haptoglobin level is almost always due to hemolysis. In a series of 100 patients with various medical conditions, a haptoglobin level of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> provided the best cutoff between hemolytic and non-hemolytic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of a haptoglobin &le;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> were 83 and 96 percent. However, a normal or increased haptoglobin does not eliminate the possibility of hemolysis because haptoglobin is an acute phase reactant that can be increased in the setting of inflammation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>). Other causes of low haptoglobin include abdominal trauma and congenital ahaptoglobinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p>However, in one series of reports, the <strong>combination</strong> of an increased serum LDH and a reduced haptoglobin was 90 percent specific for diagnosing hemolysis, while the combination of a normal serum LDH and a serum haptoglobin &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> was 92 percent sensitive for ruling out hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1419368063\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate management issues before the cause is identified</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain management issues may need to be addressed before the specific cause of hemolytic anemia is definitively established.

Individuals with a very slow decline in hemoglobin may be able to adapt to and tolerate severe anemia without end organ ischemia, whereas those with brisk hemolysis and a rapid drop in hemoglobin level may be quite symptomatic and require more aggressive treatment and accelerated evaluation, even if the absolute hemoglobin level is not that low. The rate of decline is assessed by performing serial hemoglobin levels, hematocrits, and reticulocyte counts, with the frequency determined by the clinical situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transfusion</strong> &ndash; Patients with severe anemia should be transfused with RBCs, especially if there is active bleeding, symptoms of organ ischemia, or ongoing brisk hemolysis. It may be appropriate to obtain a pre-transfusion blood sample that can be stored for later analysis, particularly if an inherited cause of hemolytic anemia is suspected. For patients with possible immune-mediated hemolysis for whom crossmatch compatible blood cannot be identified, blood designated for immediate release can be transfused.

We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red blood cells (RBCs) have properties that allow them to remain intact as they travel through the circulation and reticuloendothelial system. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the RBC is unable to maintain its intact structure. The degree of reduction in hemoglobin level is determined by the balance between the extent of hemolysis and the capacity of the bone marrow to amplify RBC production in response. Sample calculations are provided above. (See <a href=\"#H4004364487\" class=\"local\">'RBC turnover in hemolytic anemia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemolytic anemias can be classified according to whether the abnormality is intrinsic or extrinsic to the RBC (intracorpuscular versus extracorpuscular defects), whether the condition is inherited or acquired, whether the hemolysis is acute or chronic, whether the mechanism involves antibody-mediated destruction (immune versus non-immune mechanism), and whether the hemolysis occurs in the vasculature or in the reticuloendothelial macrophages in the liver and spleen (intravascular versus extravascular hemolysis). (See <a href=\"#H869344516\" class=\"local\">'Conceptual framework'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of hemolytic anemia are listed in the tables and above. (See <a href=\"#H3198943107\" class=\"local\">'List of causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is suspected in a patient with chronic or new onset anemia with reticulocytosis and not due to another obvious cause. There is no single specific diagnostic test for hemolytic anemia. Most experts consider the diagnosis to be accepted if there is reticulocytosis not explained by recent bleeding, nutrient repletion, or administration of erythropoietin; high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin with low haptoglobin; and in some cases other laboratory findings. Once the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is relatively certain, we determine the cause using information from the history and physical examination and directed laboratory testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108335\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108335 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11721243\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain management issues may need to be addressed before the specific cause of hemolytic anemia is definitively established, including the need for transfusion, plasma exchange, hydration, and hemodynamic support. The pace of the hemolysis and stability of the hemoglobin level should be assessed. Life-saving interventions should not be delayed while awaiting the results of diagnostic testing. (See <a href=\"#H1419368063\" class=\"local\">'Immediate management issues before the cause is identified'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some of the <span class=\"nowrap\">obvious/classic</span> presentations of hemolytic anemia, it may make sense to proceed directly to specific diagnostic testing to determine the specific cause. If the underlying cause is less obvious, we use the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) to distinguish between immune and non-immune hemolysis, and for those with a negative DAT, we perform directed laboratory testing based on the patient and family history, physical examination; pace and severity of hemolysis; and RBC morphology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108335\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108335 \">algorithm 1</a>). Involvement of specialists with expertise in hemolytic anemias, laboratory diagnosis, or genetic testing may be helpful in especially challenging cases. (See <a href=\"#H1095359486\" class=\"local\">'Testing to determine the cause of hemolysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is possible to have hemolysis without reticulocytosis, hemolysis without anemia, and reticulocytosis without hemolysis. Settings in which these findings occur are presented above. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Atypical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a well-known association between hemolytic anemia and thrombosis, which may be seen with either intravascular or extravascular hemolysis.
