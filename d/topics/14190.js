This can happen from sitting or lying in the same position for a very long time. &quot;Pressure ulcers&quot; and &quot;bedsores&quot; are other names for this type of damage. Doctors often use the term &quot;pressure-induced injuries.&quot;</p><p>The most common places for pressure sores are where bone is close to the skin. These areas include the ankles, back, elbows, heels, and hips (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81059\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81059 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31341911\"><span class=\"h1\">What does a pressure sore look like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At first, the sore looks like a red patch of skin. If it gets worse, the skin breaks and the sore looks like a reddish-pink, shallow crater.</p><p>Some sores look like a blister and can burst. Some severe pressure sores are so deep, you can see muscle or bone. Deep sores can also form scabs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31341926\"><span class=\"h1\">Who is at risk of pressure sores?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure sores are most common in people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot move or shift around easily because of a medical problem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are in a hospital or nursing home</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31341941\"><span class=\"h1\">Can pressure sores be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are a few things you can do to keep from getting pressure sores.</p><p>If you spend a lot of time in a bed, you can lower your chances of getting pressure sores by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turning your body at least every 2 hours (for example, from your back, to one side, then the other side)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lying with your upper body raised at a slight angle when you lie on your side. This puts less pressure on your hip bone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placing pillows or foam wedges between your ankles and knees. You can also place pillows or foam wedges under your ankles.</p><p/><p>Using a special mattress or a pad that goes on top of your mattress might also help. These mattresses or pads can be made of gel, foam, air, or water. There are also special devices that automatically adjust the surface to help relieve pressure when you lie down.</p><p>If you spend a lot of time in a chair or are in a wheelchair, you can lower your chances of pressure sores by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing chair &quot;pushups&quot; by using your arms to raise yourself off the seat. Try to do this at least once every hour.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tilting your body forward or to the side so your bottom lifts off the seat at least once every hour</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a special seat cushion filled with air, gel, or foam</p><p/><p>Taking good care of your skin is also important for preventing pressure sores. To help keep your skin as healthy as possible, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your skin regularly for signs of pressure sores</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have another person check areas that you cannot see</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean your skin regularly with mild soap</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid using hot water to wash your skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a moisturizing cream. This will help keep your skin from getting dry and flaky.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31341956\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you see or feel any areas where the surface of the skin is broken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31341971\"><span class=\"h1\">How are pressure sores treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will give you medicine to relieve pain and treat infection if it is present. Your doctor or nurse can also give you special bandages to help the sores heal.</p><p>Some people need surgery or other treatments to remove infected or dead tissue in the sore.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse can also talk to you about any problems that might have caused your pressure sore. He or she might suggest changes to help keep you from getting pressure sores in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183923614\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraplegia-and-quadriplegia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Paraplegia and quadriplegia (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
