The approach to the child with a limp is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with a limp&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4046769386\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limp is defined as an uneven, jerky, or laborious gait, usually caused by pain, weakness, or deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is a common complaint in childhood, accounting for 4 per 1000 visits in one pediatric emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Limp is caused by benign and life-threatening conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76343\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76343 \">table 1</a>), and the management varies from reassurance to major surgery depending upon the cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The cause of limp usually can be determined through a careful history and physical examination. Radiographic studies often are necessary to confirm clinical suspicions, but diagnostic procedures rarely are required. While most cases of limp are caused by trauma or benign self-limiting conditions that resolve spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], life- or limb-threatening conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67026\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67026 \">table 2</a>) must be diagnosed promptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Septic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Septic bacterial arthritis is one of the diagnoses that must not be missed in the evaluation of a child with a limp, given the potential for rapid joint destruction and long-term morbidity with delayed diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment are the single most important factors in determining the outcome of septic arthritis. The knee and hip are the joints most commonly affected; involvement of the hip is seen more commonly in infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In one review of 425 children who were admitted or seen in the emergency department during a 12-month period for a gait disturbance, 14 (3 percent) had septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Children with septic arthritis of the hip typically are febrile and ill-appearing, although occasionally the presentation is more subtle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Neonates and infants with septic arthritis of the hip may present with irritability and pseudoparalysis of the affected limb, with or without fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Weightbearing and motion of the affected hip are quite painful and strongly resisted in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other joints typically are spared, although up to 8 percent of septic arthritis in children is multifocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The presentation of septic arthritis can be altered by recent use of antibiotics.</p><p>Physical examination reveals joint effusion, periarticular warmth and tenderness, and severe pain on range of motion. Changes in the adjacent soft tissue are variable and depend upon the duration of infection and the depth of the joint. Soft tissue changes usually do not occur with infections of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>].</p><p>When assessing a child with possible septic arthritis, measurement of the white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are potentially useful. Of these measurements, the CRP is the best independent indicator of septic arthritis, especially if it is &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. It is also more frequently abnormal in patients with bacterial arthritis, rises quicker in response to infection, and decreases sooner with successful treatment. If the CRP is &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L),</span> the negative predictive value is 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However the clinician has to always take into account risk factors, physical findings, and other laboratory results when determining patient management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Clinical rules have been developed to aid in differentiating septic arthritis of the hip from transient synovitis. However, these clinical prediction rules do not apply to assessment of joints other than the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. These rules are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with a limp&quot;, section on 'Bacterial arthritis of the hip'</a>.)</p><p>The ESR, the most sensitive test, is elevated in 90 percent of cases but lacks specificity. In one retrospective comparison of 94 children with septic arthritis and 38 children with transient synovitis who presented to a pediatric emergency department with hip pain, the combination of ESR greater than 20 mm per hour <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> temperature greater than 37.5&ordm;C detected 97 percent of those with septic arthritis, but 50 percent had unnecessary hip aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The white blood cell (WBC) count, which is elevated in 30 to 60 percent of cases, also lacks specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Plain radiographs may show subtle signs of joint effusion such as widening of the joint space, soft tissue swelling, obliteration of normal fat planes, or changes of osteomyelitis, such as periosteal elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Bone scans rarely are indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The definitive diagnosis is made by examination of synovial fluid obtained through arthrocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteomyelitis is an infection of bone that occurs most commonly in children younger than five years of age. The incidence of osteomyelitis in limping children who present to a pediatric emergency department or orthopedic clinic is approximately 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>].</p><p>Establishing the diagnosis of osteomyelitis can be challenging because the initial symptoms are frequently nonspecific and mild. If the suspicion is low for osteomyelitis, than normal ESR and CRP may be adequate for ruling out disease, but if suspicion is high, as in puncture wounds or high risk patients then further investigation may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The epidemiology, clinical features, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of hematogenous osteomyelitis in children are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Clinical features and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Discitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discitis refers to inflammation of the intervertebral disc. The etiology is controversial. Although disc biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis, as many as 60 percent of biopsied discs grow bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus. However, children often recover without antibiotic therapy. The current consensus, backed by scant supportive evidence, is that discitis in children usually represents low-grade infection and is on one end of the spectrum of vertebral osteomyelitis. Affected children are usually younger than five years of age although cases occur through adolescence. The lumbar spine is most frequently involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;, section on 'Discitis'</a>.)</p><p>Discitis typically presents with the gradual onset of irritability and back pain, limp, or refusal to crawl or walk, without systemic toxicity; fever usually is absent or low grade. In some patients, abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting may be the only complaints. Most patients have had symptoms for three or more weeks by the time discitis is diagnosed. Examination findings may include refusal to bend forward, percussion tenderness over the involved spine, hip pain and stiffness, decreased muscle strength or reflexes, and, with high lesions (T8-L1) ileus. The clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of discitis are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;, section on 'Discitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Myositis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign acute childhood myositis is a self-limited illness that occurs during epidemics of influenza A and B. Epidemiology varies by the causative organism. For example, during the 2007 to 2008 influenza season, benign myositis of childhood was strongly associated with influenza B activity and predominantly affected school-aged boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Muscle pain, tenderness, and sometimes swelling develop during the first week of influenza illness. The calf muscles typically are the most severely affected. The child may refuse to walk or walk on his or her toes, and refuse to dorsiflex the feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. On examination, the calves are exquisitely tender.</p><p>Muscle enzymes may be elevated up to 20 to 30 times normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, myoglobinuria and acute renal failure do not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Muscle biopsy during the symptomatic phase (not necessary for diagnosis) reveals evidence of muscle necrosis and muscle fiber regeneration, with mild infiltration of polymorphonuclear or mononuclear leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Full clinical recovery typically is seen in 3 to 10 days, with resolution of the elevated muscle enzymes occurring within three weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other conditions that can cause limp in children include epidural abscess, psoas abscess, retroperitoneal abscess, iliac adenitis, lower extremity cellulitis, skeletal tuberculosis, meningitis, and post-meningococcal skeletal dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].

It is characterized by pain and limitation of motion in the hip that arises without clear precipitant and resolves gradually with conservative therapy. In one prospective study, the average annual incidence was 0.2 percent, with a cumulative lifetime risk of 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. TS typically presents in patients between the ages of three and eight years, with a mean age at presentation of six years and a male-to-female ratio of slightly more than 2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p>At clinical presentation, most children have had symptoms for one to three days, although 12 percent in the largest series had discomfort dating back at least one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Fever typically is absent, and children are nontoxic in appearance. A fever (temperature &gt;38.5&deg;C [101.3&deg;F]) should greatly raise suspicion for septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Symptoms affect both hips in as many as 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Even in symptomatically unilateral disease, ultrasound can detect bilateral effusions in 25 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Children with TS have an antalgic gait and usually prefer to keep the hip in abduction and external rotation.</p><p>Hip infection must be excluded. Patients with clinical or laboratory findings of concern (eg, inability to weight bear, fever (temperature &gt;38.5&deg;C [101.3&deg;F]), CRP &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl,</span> or ESR &gt;20 mm per hour) should undergo hip ultrasonography and be considered for diagnostic arthrocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. In studies with lower prevalence of septic hip arthritis, fever, inability to bear weight, and CRP performed the best in predicting septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/14,18,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,41</a>]. Radiographs are performed to exclude other diseases. Some authors recommend ultrasonography to confirm the presence of the hip effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with a limp&quot;, section on 'Bacterial arthritis of the hip'</a>.)</p><p>The management of TS is conservative, with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and return to full activity as tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The prognosis usually is excellent, with full recovery to be expected within one to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Recurrence rates from 4 to 15 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other conditions to be considered in the child who presents with limp include appendicitis, immunoglobulin A vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura), infectious arthritis, reactive arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, dermatomyositis, serum sickness, and dactylitis of sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].

(See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of trauma often is present in children who present with limp caused by lower extremity fracture or sprain. However, the history of trauma may be lacking in children with toddlers fractures or stress fractures, or those who have experienced child abuse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Toddlers fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toddlers fractures were originally defined to occur in children between 9 and 36 months of age and to involve the distal one-third of the tibia; the mechanism of injury usually is trivial (eg, falling from a low height, tripping, or twisting the ankle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Such fractures are now believed to be a subset of a more common disease, childhood accidental spiral tibial (CAST) fractures. The mean age for accidental spiral tibial fractures in children is 50.7 months with a range of 12 to 94 months. Only one-third of children classified with CAST fractures are younger than 36 months. Most CAST fractures involve the distal half of the tibia, not just the distal third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Most children with toddlers fractures refuse to bear weight on the affected extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The physical examination findings usually are subtle. Bruising and deformity are absent, although local tenderness, swelling, or warmth may be present. Pain usually can be elicited by dorsiflexion of the ankle or if the examiner grasps the knee and ankle of the affected extremity and twists in opposite directions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/24,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,49,50</a>].</p><p>Similar to the physical examination findings, the radiographic finding, a faint lucent oblique line crossing the distal tibia and terminating medially, also is subtle. This finding is best seen with an internal oblique view, although it may be present on the anteroposterior view; it is seen poorly on the lateral view. Initial radiographs may be normal in as many as 43 percent of cases, so in characteristic cases the diagnosis of toddlers fracture should be highly consider even if radiographs are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/47,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50-52</a>]. The diagnosis of a toddlers fracture may be made in a child with the characteristic radiographic findings, even if the mechanism of injury is not known. By contrast, in children who have fractures in the midshaft of the tibia, alternative mechanisms, including child abuse, should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Similar to toddlers&rsquo; fractures, the presentation of these fractures may be subtle and initial radiographs negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Bone scintigraphy may reveal focal uptake, and subsequent plain radiographs may reveal the characteristic sclerosis of a healing fracture in cancellous bone. In one study of 56 preschool children who presented with lower extremity pain or gait abnormality and normal plain radiographs, bone scan was abnormal in 30 patients, and one-half of these abnormalities were in the tarsal bones of the foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Some authors characterize these fractures as another form of toddlers fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/53,54,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54,57</a>] and recommend greater awareness, more careful foot examination, and consideration to follow-up radiographs of the foot on any toddler with a persistent limp after trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, the clinical significance of these fractures is not known because they tend to heal without sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An overview of the diagnosis and treatment of stress fractures is discussed separately.

Bone remodeling, which consists of bone resorption followed by new bone formation, occurs in response to the applied stress. Under normal circumstances, the remodeling process results in the formation of strong bone along the lines of stress. However, in circumstances of persistent or increased stress during the period in which bone resorption predominates, a stress fracture can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Stress fractures should be considered in children who have history of new or increased sports activity. In one retrospective descriptive series of 368 stress fractures in athletes, 40 percent of the fractures occurred in children younger than 19 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Pain may be exacerbated by direct trauma, running, jumping, or kneeling, and is relieved by rest. On examination, localized tenderness and, often, a prominence of the tibial tuberosity with soft tissue swelling are present; occasionally, a palpable bony mass is found. Pain may be reproduced by extending the knee against resistance or squatting with the knee in full flexion. The hamstrings may be shortened and the quadriceps taut. The range of motion is not affected, and the knee and patellofemoral joint are stable.

The femur is the most common site of occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Although osteoid osteoma is seen in all age groups, most patients present in the teenage years; 70 percent of cases occur in individuals younger than 20 years of age. Osteoid osteoma occurs twice as commonly in boys as in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

In one series of 52 children with osteoid osteoma who were younger than five years of age, limp was present in 63 percent of those with involvement of the leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Young children also may present with swelling, muscular atrophy, leg length discrepancy, bone deformities, and muscle contractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

Persistent pain or swelling may be attributed erroneously to a minor injury. Tumor should be considered in children with complaints of bone pain when the pain occurs at night, at rest, and in nonarticular locations. The two most common sites for bone tumors are the distal femur and proximal tibia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/5,88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,88,89</a>].

The important findings are at the &quot;margin,&quot; or interface, of the intraosseous lesion and the normal bone. In benign tumors, sclerotic changes are present at the interface, and the margins are clearly defined. In contrast, rapidly growing malignant tumors do not permit the development of sclerotic changes and no defined margin surrounding the area of destruction is seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>Radiographic signs characteristic of malignant tumors include &quot;onion skinning&quot; and the &quot;sunburst&quot; phenomenon. The appearance of onion skin is caused by repetitive periosteal reactions, each depositing a layer of calcium, as the tumor grows beyond the periosteum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61818\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61818 \">image 14</a>). The sunburst phenomenon occurs when malignant osteoclasts deposit calcium blood vessels that radiate perpendicularly from the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

They include peripheral neuropathy, spastic paralysis (eg, cerebral palsy), ataxia, spinal problems (spinal cord tumors, spinal dysraphism, spondylolisthesis), and muscular dystrophy. Acute limp may be caused by central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage or Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. Further, cerebellar ataxia may be confused with limp and indicate a posterior fossa CNS lesion.

Inflammatory and toxic conditions can present acutely. The lower extremities usually are affected first, and the involvement typically is bilateral, symmetric, and predominantly distal. The important clinical findings are weakness and delayed or absent deep tendon reflexes. Weakness may present as clumsiness or difficulty with running or climbing stairs. Sensory symptoms include numbness, dysesthesias such as burning pain, or ataxia. Autonomic symptoms such as abnormal sweating, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, or bowel and bladder dysfunction may accompany peripheral neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuromuscular junction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tick paralysis caused by Dermacentor ticks usually begins with paresthesias and a sense of fatigue and weakness, although individual patients may sometimes appear irritable or restless and complain of muscular pain. Fever is characteristically absent, and there is no change in the sensorium or headache unless severe hypoxia or hypercarbia are present. Most patients eventually develop an unsteady gait that progresses to an ascending complete paralysis. Deep tendon reflexes are characteristically absent. Respiratory paralysis and death can occur in severe cases.

Affected children have difficulty running, jumping, and walking up steps. When arising from the floor, affected boys also may use hand support to push themselves to an upright position, an action termed Gowers sign. An unusual waddling gait, lumbar lordosis, and calf enlargement usually are observed. Complaints of leg pain may also be found with early disease.

It frequently begins after an injury, surgery, or vascular event. The etiology of RSD is unclear; peripheral nerve dysfunction resulting in sympathetic nerve hyperactivity appears to play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most children with RSD are girls (67 to 84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/82-84,98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84,98,99</a>].

The pain usually improves with activity and is associated with sensitivity to light touch (allodynia), episodic mottling, cyanosis, increased sweating, swelling, or a difference in the skin temperature between the involved and uninvolved extremity. In addition, it typically improves with activity. Tache c&eacute;r&eacute;brale, the finding of persistent erythema after stroking the skin with a blunt object, is a useful sign of vasomotor dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].
