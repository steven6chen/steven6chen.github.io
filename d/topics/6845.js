It is characterized by specific symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue, and signs, such as those related to fluid retention. There are many ways to assess cardiac function. However, there is no diagnostic test for HF, since it is largely a clinical diagnosis that is based upon a careful history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55866\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55866 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the patient with suspected heart failure (HF) includes the history and physical examination, and diagnostic tests to help establish the diagnosis, assess acuity and severity, and initiate assessment of etiology. Recommendations for the evaluation of patients with HF were included in the 2013 American College of Cardiology guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the 2010 Heart Failure Society of America guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], the 2012 European Society of Cardiology guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and the 2012 Canadian Cardiovascular Society consensus conference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The discussion below focuses on diagnosis of HF. The history and physical examination of the patient with suspected HF should also include assessment of risk factors and potential etiologies of HF as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of HF include those due to excess fluid accumulation (dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, pain from hepatic congestion, and abdominal discomfort due to distention from ascites) and those due to a reduction in cardiac output (fatigue, weakness) that is most pronounced with exertion. Fluid retention in HF is initiated by the fall in cardiac output, leading to alterations in renal function, due in part to activation of the sodium-retaining renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Neurohumoral adaptations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Important information concerning the acuity of HF is suggested by the presenting symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute and subacute presentations (days to weeks) are characterized primarily by shortness of breath, at rest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with exertion. Also common are orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and, with right HF, right upper quadrant discomfort due to acute hepatic congestion, which can be confused with acute cholecystitis. Patients with atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular tachyarrhythmias may complain of palpitations with or without lightheadedness.</p><p/><p>Patients with acute decompensated HF require prompt diagnosis and management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic presentations (months) differ in that fatigue, anorexia, abdominal distension, and peripheral edema may be more pronounced than dyspnea. The anorexia is secondary to several factors including poor perfusion of the splanchnic circulation, bowel edema, and nausea induced by hepatic congestion. Over time, pulmonary venous and lymphatic capacitance accommodates to the chronic state of volume overload, leading to less or no fluid accumulation in the alveoli, despite the increase in total lung water. These patients present with excessive fatigue and low-output symptoms.</p><p/><p>Other clinical features such as older age, history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction, and use of a loop diuretic are associated with increased likelihood of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As discussed below, the history alone is insufficient to make the diagnosis of HF. (See <a href=\"#H12260556\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic accuracy of clinical features'</a> below.) </p><p>Nevertheless, a detailed history remains the single best discriminator to determine the acuity, etiology, and rate of progression of HF and the history often provides important clues to the cause of HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination can provide evidence of the presence and extent of cardiac filling pressure elevation, volume overload, ventricular enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and reduction in cardiac output.</p><p>In the study of primary care patients cited above, the physical finding of a displaced apical impulse had the best combination of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of any physical sign of HF with reduced ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other strong predictors of HF included a gallop rhythm and elevated jugular venous pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Vital signs and appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with advanced HF may show evidence of a major decline in cardiac output and therefore a decrease in tissue perfusion. Four major findings suggest severity of the cardiac dysfunction: resting sinus tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, diaphoresis, and peripheral vasoconstriction. The last abnormality is manifested as cool, pale, and sometimes cyanotic extremities (due to the combination of decreased perfusion and increased oxygen extraction). Peripheral vasoconstriction may be absent in patients treated with vasodilators. A decrease in cardiac output should be suspected when the pulse pressure is reduced below 25 mmHg.</p><p>Both the cardiac disease itself and the secondary neurohumoral adaptation contribute to the low output state. Patients compensate for a fall in cardiac output by increasing sympathetic outflow with resultant shunting of the cardiac output to vital organs.</p><p>An irregularly irregular pulse is suggestive of atrial fibrillation which frequently accompanies HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three major manifestations of volume overload in patients with HF: pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure.</p><p>Pulmonary congestion that may manifest as rales is more prominent in acute or subacute disease. As noted above, chronic HF is associated with increases in venous capacitance and lymphatic drainage of the lungs; as a result, rales are often absent even though the pulmonary capillary pressure is elevated. Continued sodium retention in this setting preferentially accumulates in the periphery although a chronic elevation in pulmonary venous pressure can lead to pleural effusions.</p><p>Peripheral edema is manifested by swelling of the legs (which is more prominent when the patient has been upright), and may also cause ascites, scrotal edema, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;</a>). In this setting, manual compression of the right upper quadrant to increase venous return may elevate jugular venous pressure above the transient 1 to 3 cm elevations seen in normal individuals. This sign is known as the hepatojugular reflux. </p><p>Elevated jugular venous pressure is usually present if peripheral edema is due to HF, since it is the high intracapillary pressure that is responsible for fluid movement into the interstitium. With the patient sitting at 45&ordm; jugular venous pressure can be estimated from the height above the left atrium of venous pulsations in the internal jugular vein. The height of external jugular vein pulsations may also be helpful but care must be taken to avoid spurious interpretation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The accuracy of clinical volume assessment is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H12260556\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic accuracy of clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulsus alternans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulsus alternans, if present, is virtually pathognomonic of severe left ventricular (LV) systolic failure. This phenomenon is characterized by evenly spaced alternating strong and weak peripheral pulses. It is best appreciated by applying light pressure on the peripheral arterial pulse and can be confirmed by measuring the blood pressure. When the cuff pressure is slowly released, phase I Korotkoff sounds are initially heard only during the alternate strong beats; with further release of cuff pressure, the softer sounds of the weak beat also appear. The degree of pulsus alternans can be quantitated by measuring the difference in systolic pressure between the strong and the weak beat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;, section on 'Pulsus alternans'</a>.)</p><p>The pathophysiology of pulsus alternans is not well understood. The severe ventricular dysfunction may be associated with variations in contractility secondary to shifts in afterload, preload, and electrical excitability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Precordial palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular chamber size can be estimated by precordial palpation. An apical impulse that is laterally displaced past the midclavicular line is usually indicative of LV enlargement. LV dysfunction can also lead to sustained apical impulse, which may be accompanied by a parasternal lift in the setting of right ventricular hypertrophy or enlargement. The S3 may be palpable in severe ventricular failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-precordial-pulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the precordial pulsation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart sounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An S3 gallop is associated with left atrial pressures exceeding 20 mmHg and increased LV end-diastolic pressures (&gt;15 mmHg). However, there is appreciable interobserver variability in the ability to detect an S3 that cannot be solely explained by the experience of the observer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition, in a phonocardiographic study of patients who were undergoing cardiac catheterization, an S3 was not very sensitive (40 to 50 percent) for the detection of an elevated LV end-diastolic pressure or a reduced LV ejection fraction; however, the S3 was highly specific (90 percent) for these parameters and for an elevated serum brain natriuretic peptide concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similarly, an S3 (or &quot;extra heart sound&quot;) has a low sensitivity (eg, 4 to 11 percent) but high specificity (eg, 99 percent) for clinical diagnosis of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

These patients may also complain of substernal chest pressure, typical of angina. In this setting, elevated right ventricular end-diastolic pressure leads to secondary right ventricular subendocardial ischemia. Physical signs of pulmonary hypertension can include increased intensity of P2, a murmur of pulmonary insufficiency, a parasternal lift, and a palpable pulmonic tap (felt in the left second intercostal space).

In this population, hepatomegaly was also highly specific (97 percent) but had low sensitivity (17 percent). Greater specificity than sensitivity was also seen for cardiomegaly (85 and 27 percent), lung crepitation (81 and 51 percent), edema (72 and 53 percent), and elevated jugular venous pressure (70 and 52 percent).</p><p/><p>The accuracy of clinical evaluation of cardiac filling pressures varies among observers as illustrated by a study of 116 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Signs of elevated right heart filling pressure included increased jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, and ascites. Signs of elevated left heart filling pressure included findings of elevated right heart filling pressure as well as gallops or rales. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right and left heart filling pressures were accurately estimated by physical examination in 71 and 60 percent of 215 observations.
