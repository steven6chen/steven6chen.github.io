The duodenum is a common site of tumors (gastrinomas) in these patients, and carcinoid tumors, adrenal adenomas, and lipomas are more common than in the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of MEN1 will be reviewed here.

The presence of MEN1 is defined clinically as the occurrence of two or more primary MEN1 tumor types, or in family members of a patient with a clinical diagnosis of MEN1, the occurrence of one of the MEN1-associated tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 1</a>). It should be noted that these are clinical definitions and do not necessarily indicate that mutation of the MEN1 gene will be identifiable or responsible.

In most cases, it is the initial manifestation of MEN1. Reliable incidence figures do not exist, but it has been estimated that the incidence of MEN1 ranges from 1 to 18 percent in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Primary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of familial MEN1 has a number of different features from the common sporadic (non-familial) form of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The male-to-female ratio is even in MEN1 in contrast to the female predominance in sporadic hyperparathyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperparathyroidism in MEN1 typically presents in the second to fourth decade of life, approximately two decades earlier than in sporadic hyperparathyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple gland disease is typical in MEN1 and, given sufficient time, perhaps universal. In comparison, approximately 80 to 85 percent of patients with sporadic disease have single parathyroid adenomas. There can be marked asymmetry in size among the distinct glands and, upon initial neck exploration, some parathyroid glands in MEN1 may appear to be grossly normal. However, even the smaller glands will generally exhibit hypercellularity on histologic examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A strong and seemingly inexorable proliferative drive in parathyroid cells appears to exist in classical MEN1, as indicated by the high rate of recurrent hyperparathyroidism after apparently successful subtotal parathyroidectomy. One report from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as an example, found a recurrence rate above 50 percent at 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; most other studies have had shorter follow-up periods. The high recurrence rate clearly distinguishes the hyperparathyroidism of MEN1 from that seen in sporadic disease. It has also resulted in differences of opinion with respect to optimal surgical management of this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Similar to sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism, the majority of patients are asymptomatic, and hypercalcemia is detected by routine biochemical screening. If clinical manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism are present, they may include decreased bone mineral density, kidney stones, and symptoms of hypercalcemia (eg, polyuria, polydipsia, constipation). The biochemical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is based, as it is in all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, on the demonstration of hypercalcemia with inappropriately high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pituitary adenomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically apparent pituitary adenomas have been found in approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients with MEN1 when sought by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and 42 percent in a multicenter study of 324 MEN1 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The pituitary cell type is similar to that found in sporadic pituitary adenomas. Thus, the most common type of pituitary adenoma in MEN1 is lactotroph, but somatotroph, corticotroph, gonadotroph, and clinically nonfunctioning tumors can also occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 1</a>). Multiple pituitary tumors are rarely present in MEN1.</p><p>The phenotypic presentation of pituitary disease is variable. In one large kindred, as an example, lactotroph adenomas predominated, and none of the 165 patients had acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. Furthermore, the distribution of lactotroph adenomas was not even; the prevalence was more than 50 percent in some branches of the kindred and very low in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A multicenter study of 324 MEN1 patients (42 percent of whom had pituitary tumors), compared with 110 non-MEN patients with pituitary adenomas, revealed that [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 136 MEN1 patients with pituitary adenomas, 85 percent had macroadenomas (versus 42 percent in non-MEN1 patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the same patients, hormonal hypersecretion was normalized in 42 percent after treatment versus 90 percent in non-MEN1 patients, reflecting the finding that the MEN1 patients had adenomas that were larger and more aggressive than those in non-MEN patients.</p><p/><p>In contrast, another study, which examined the results of systematic presymptomatic screening for pituitary adenomas over a significant follow-up period (median 6 years), showed that such screening primarily detected nonfunctioning microadenomas that grew only occasionally and without clinical consequence; detected prolactinomas responded well to medical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Whether a program of routine and lifelong surveillance by imaging would decrease morbidity from pituitary disease in MEN1 remains unknown.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, approach to diagnosis, and therapy of pituitary adenomas in patients with MEN1 is similar to that in patients with sporadic adenomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;, section on 'Pituitary adenomas'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective treatment is usually available for the hyperparathyroidism and pituitary disease in MEN1; as a result, the malignant potential of enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is now the primary life-threatening manifestation of MEN1.</p><p>Functioning pancreatic islet cell or gastrointestinal endocrine cell tumors become clinically apparent in approximately one-third of patients with MEN1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 1</a>). The most common cause of symptomatic disease is the Zollinger-Ellison (gastrinoma) syndrome (ZES), leading to multiple peptic ulcers. It has been estimated that 60 percent of patients with MEN1 have either ZES or asymptomatic elevation in serum gastrin concentrations; on the other hand, MEN1 is present in 20 to 60 percent of patients with ZES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Symptomatic insulinomas also occur with moderate frequency, while VIPomas and glucagonomas are rare (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vipoma-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;VIPoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagonoma and the glucagonoma syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of radiographically confirmed, nonfunctioning tumors is similar to that of gastrinomas, ranging from 30 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Like hormonally active enteropancreatic tumors in MEN1, clinically &quot;nonfunctioning&quot; pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may be malignant and capable of causing liver metastases.

It is now apparent that the basis for the failure of these approaches, namely resection of palpable tumors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> partial pancreatectomy, is due to the biological nature and characteristics of the tumors in MEN1. In contrast to sporadically occurring gastrinomas, the gastrinomas in MEN1 patients are multifocal, often exceedingly small, and easily overlooked. In addition, the duodenum is a common site of gastrinomas both in MEN1 and in sporadic gastrinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,16</a>]; in comparison, in MEN1, the tumors that are found in the pancreas do not usually secrete gastrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The risk of death from malignant spread of MEN1-associated gastrinoma appears to be less than that for sporadic gastrinoma. Local lymph node metastases are common but are not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis or a high likelihood that clinically important metastases will occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In one large series, investigators at the NIH prospectively followed 107 patients with MEN1 and ZES and reviewed 1009 cases from the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The diagnosis is confirmed by the same biochemical and gastric acid output criteria as are used in the sporadic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,20</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>). Hypercalcemia from coexisting hyperparathyroidism can significantly exacerbate the symptoms of ZES, and parathyroidectomy to correct hypercalcemia can reduce fasting and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> stimulated gastrin levels and basal acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The incidence of Cushing's syndrome has been reported to be increased in patients with ZES. When Cushing's syndrome occurs in patients with nonfamilial gastrinoma, the usual cause is ectopic corticotropin (ACTH) release from the islet-cell tumor. These cases are associated with severe symptoms. In contrast, patients with familial MEN1 and ZES who develop Cushing's syndrome usually have a corticotroph adenoma of the pituitary and relatively mild symptoms of cortisol excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin-producing pancreatic islet cell adenomas in MEN1 are often small, may be multiple, and may be associated with the simultaneous presence of other islet cell tumors. Insulinoma in MEN1 typically presents in the second to fourth decade of life, earlier than in sporadic insulinoma, which usually occurs in individuals older than 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The diagnosis of insulinoma depends, as in nonfamilial causes, upon the documentation of hypoglycemia with characteristic symptoms that are rapidly reversed by the administration of glucose, and inappropriately high serum insulin concentrations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to recognize that pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in MEN1 often synthesize multiple hormones. But hormone synthesis does not always have clinical consequences, suggesting that many such tumors may be defective in their peptide hormone processing apparatus or have an inefficient secretory mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Like hormonally active enteropancreatic tumors in MEN1, clinically &quot;nonfunctioning&quot; pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may be malignant and can metastasize to the liver. Nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have been detected as early as ages 12 to 14 in asymptomatic children with MEN1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are among the most common tumor of the pancreaticoduodenal region in patients with MEN1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In a report of 579 MEN1 patients, 108 patients with isolated nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were identified with the following clinical characteristics and course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The penetrance of nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors was 34 percent at age 50 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks of metastasis and death were low for patients with tumors &le;20 mm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Average life expectancy for patients with nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors was similar to that for gastrinoma patients (69 to 70 years) and shorter than that for patients without pancreatic tumors (77 years).</p><p/><p>The best way to detect these nonfunctioning tumors is unclear. A limited amount of data suggests that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) outperforms CT scanning in this setting, and a combination of MRI plus EUS has been recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. <sup>68</sup>Gallium-DOTATATE <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanning has been reported to have especially high sensitivity for detecting neuroendocrine tumors in MEN1, at times leading to a change in management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In large part, this is due to a dearth of solid data showing that preclinical detection of MEN1-related tumors leads to interventions that improve morbidity or mortality. This situation contrasts, for example, with the established value of RET DNA testing in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) kindreds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80814 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>).

Situations in which DNA testing can be helpful may arise when the diagnosis of MEN1 is unable to be clearly established on clinical grounds and would alter management. Examples may include some patients with a suggestive family history who present with isolated primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] or those with apparently sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), some of whom will have <em>MEN1</em> mutation and would therefore be managed differently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Relevant factors to consider in these situations include the expected yield of testing, or likelihood of a positive result, which can vary markedly depending on the specific clinical presentation. For example, while <em>MEN1</em> gene mutation is detectable in approximately 70 percent of kindreds with classic familial MEN1, the yield of testing drops to 7 percent in individuals with a sporadic presentation of combined hyperparathyroidism and pituitary adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Approximately 10 percent of kindreds with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism have a detectable <em>MEN1</em> mutation, and yields can be even lower when less stringent criteria are selected, such as sporadic isolated hyperparathyroidism with age under 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Cost-benefit considerations can importantly influence decision-making. Sequencing costs remain substantial (and variably covered by insurance in the United States). It is also important to recognize that a negative result (mutation not detected) does not rule out the diagnosis of MEN1 nor the possibility that unidentified pathologic disruption of the <em>MEN1</em> gene is responsible. Beyond assessing whether detection of an <em>MEN1</em> mutation would impact a patient's immediate clinical management, factors influencing the decision to test include an examination of the potential utility of a positive finding for the purposes of family screening and one's approach to the prospective surveillance for MEN1-related tumors in the proband and family. (See <a href=\"#H14907078\" class=\"local\">'Screening for MEN1-associated tumors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24809205\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening of family members in MEN1 kindreds</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H290089\"><span class=\"h3\">Candidates for screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We have a discussion about DNA testing with the index patient and appropriate family members, making decisions on a case-by-case basis. Involvement of a genetic counselor can be very helpful. Proper informed consent must be obtained for each individual to be tested.</p><p>When a patient is diagnosed as having MEN1, the issue of screening family members who are at risk often arises. In general, the primary and most compelling purpose of such screening in human tumor predisposition syndromes is to prevent disease-related morbidity and mortality that would otherwise occur. However, there is at present little evidence that early, preclinical detection actually reduces overall morbidity or mortality in MEN1. Nonetheless, because benefit seems likely in some instances and because other helpful information can potentially result, screening may be pursued and DNA-based testing merits serious consideration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H290095\"><span class=\"h3\">Screening approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If DNA-based family screening is to be pursued, the initial step is to test the <em>MEN1</em> gene, usually from a sample of peripheral blood or buccal cells, from the affected index case, if not already performed. If MEN1 sequencing of the affected patient does reveal a pathologic mutation, the presence or absence of this family-specific mutation can then be determined in at-risk relatives. Thus, a significant potential benefit of such testing is the identification of family members who do not have the mutation and therefore do not need regular surveillance. The value of this benefit is enhanced to the extent that the clinician tends to opt for one of the more costly or intensive approaches to surveillance to detect MEN1-associated conditions in at-risk individuals. (See <a href=\"#H14907078\" class=\"local\">'Screening for MEN1-associated tumors'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence of the mutation in an asymptomatic family member does not indicate the need for a major intervention but does focus the need for regular surveillance (eg, assessment of symptoms, signs, biochemical tests) on these individuals. It is possible that an asymptomatic individual's knowledge that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> definitely carries the disease gene may increase compliance with surveillance visits and testing. Other issues include genetic discrimination, which, in the United States, remains a potential concern, despite certain protections in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. Approaches to DNA testing and screening can vary in different nations.</p><p>Finally, knowledge of a family's specific <em>MEN1</em> mutation can resolve the small potential for diagnostic confusion attributable to rare MEN1 phenocopies within MEN1 kindreds, namely individuals who can initially be classified as having the syndrome when they develop a typical tumor (eg, prolactinoma) but may then be proven by DNA testing to have not inherited the pathologic mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H290076\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative to DNA screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DNA-based screening can yield useful information, although it is certainly not mandatory. If DNA testing is not employed for screening asymptomatic family members, one low-cost option is measurement of serum calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This approach exploits the high penetrance of hyperparathyroidism in MEN1. In addition, adding measurements of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ionized calcium and assuring the absence of vitamin D deficiency may improve sensitivity and specificity of screening. Also, as noted above, the presence of angiofibromas or collagenomas can be useful in this context.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14907078\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR MEN1-ASSOCIATED TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), known MEN1 carriers, and family members whose risk has not been eliminated by DNA testing, we screen for MEN1-associated tumors as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We maintain clinical vigilance for symptoms or signs that could be due to MEN1-associated tumors.

Often we will initially perform an imaging study for enteropancreatic neoplasia, favoring modalities and subsequent intervals that minimize radiation exposure (eg, endoscopic ultrasound) and address factors like patient anxiety.</p><p/><p>The extent to which additional surveillance for endocrine tumors, employing biochemical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic methods, should be used can be debated since evidence for their efficacy in improving outcomes is not strong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,41</a>]. Nevertheless, some published guidelines have opted for pointing the clinician to a more aggressive screening protocol for MEN1-associated risks beginning at very early ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,38</a>]. A 2012 paper, for example, while acknowledging weaknesses in available supporting data, suggested routine annual measurement of serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), gastrin, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), prolactin, and chromogranin-A, starting in childhood and continuing for life. Imaging tests (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the pituitary and <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/computed</span> tomography [CT] <span class=\"nowrap\">scan/endoscopic</span> ultrasound (EUS) to evaluate for enteropancreatic tumors) were suggested every one to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Others have recommended more limited biochemical testing and somewhat different imaging approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,41</a>].</p><p>We believe that cost-effectiveness and risk-benefit considerations (including those related to diagnostic radiation exposure) can be taken into account in determining the prospective preclinical surveillance program of an individual with MEN1 or a family member at risk, beyond the maintenance of disease-focused clinical vigilance. For example, annual measurement of serum calcium offers the opportunity to inexpensively detect asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism, which might be treated surgically. Other combinations of biochemical and imaging surveillance, including those in published protocols, can reasonably be used but are not mandatory given the absence of support by high-quality evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. New advances in treatment could dramatically alter these recommendations; for example, a future demonstration that an aggressive surgical approach to gastrinoma clearly improves disease-related mortality would provide a rationale for intensive biochemical and anatomic screening, which is capable of detecting gastrointestinal or pancreatic disease in asymptomatic family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2976704172\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

MEN1 is defined as the presence of two of the three main MEN1 tumor types, or in family members of a patient with a clinical diagnosis of MEN1, the occurrence of one of the MEN1-associated tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition of MEN1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, multiple parathyroid tumors causing primary hyperparathyroidism are the initial manifestation of MEN1, displaying almost 100 percent penetrance by age 40 to 50 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 1</a>). Similar to sporadic adenomas causing primary hyperparathyroidism, the majority of patients are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and hypercalcemia is detected by routine biochemical screening. The biochemical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is based, as it is in all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, upon the demonstration of hypercalcemia with inappropriately high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Primary hyperparathyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common type of pituitary adenoma in MEN1 is a lactotroph adenoma, but somatotroph, corticotroph, gonadotroph, and clinically nonfunctioning adenomas can also occur. The approach to diagnosis and therapy of pituitary adenomas in patients with MEN1 is similar to that in patients with sporadic adenomas. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pituitary adenomas'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of a sellar mass'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functioning pancreatic islet cell or gastrointestinal endocrine cell tumors become clinically apparent in approximately one-third of patients with MEN1. The most common cause of symptomatic disease is the Zollinger-Ellison (gastrinoma) syndrome (ZES) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DNA testing for <em>MEN1</em> gene mutations is available commercially and can provide valuable information in specific situations, although its results generally do not dictate use of a major intervention established to improve morbidity or mortality. We make determinations regarding MEN1 DNA testing on a case-by-case basis, but discussions with patient and genetic counselor more often than not lead to pursuit of such testing. Biochemical screening (ie, serum calcium) of family members can be considered as a less costly alternative to genetic screening, given the high penetrance of primary hyperparathyroidism in MEN1, although its negative predictive value at younger ages is limited. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'MEN1 mutational analysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24809205\" class=\"local\">'Screening of family members in MEN1 kindreds'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We carefully monitor all patients with MEN1, known <em>MEN1</em> mutation carriers, and at-risk family members with unknown carrier status for symptoms or signs of MEN1-associated tumors, such as nephrolithiasis, amenorrhea (women), galactorrhea, erectile dysfunction (men), peptic ulcer disease, diarrhea, and neuroglycopenic or sympathoadrenal symptoms from hypoglycemia. We typically measure serum calcium, PTH, and prolactin annually to detect asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism and prolactinoma, respectively. Often, we perform additional surveillance using biochemical and imaging modalities. Others routinely use more aggressive screening protocols for MEN1-associated risks, beginning at very early ages. Differences in approaches to surveillance in large part relate to the poor quality of supportive evidence in this area.
