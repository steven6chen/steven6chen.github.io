The primary risk factors include tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The relative prevalence of these risk factors contributes to the variation in the observed distribution of head and neck cancer in different areas of the world. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The chronic exposure of the upper aerodigestive tract to these and other risk factors is thought to produce field cancerization, a process in which patients with cancer or premalignant dysplastic lesions in the oral mucosa are at significant risk for head and neck cancer. The understanding of field cancerization provides the rationale for chemoprevention to decrease the incidence of SCCHN.</p><p>The use of chemoprevention to block the progression of precancerous lesions and the potential role of screening are discussed in this topic, focusing primarily on carcinogen-related head and neck cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1095522675\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR CHEMOPREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for pharmacologic chemoprevention in patients at risk for the development of invasive cancer is based upon two factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Field cancerization &ndash; Patients with carcinogen-related squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) have a predilection for cancer development throughout the oral and oropharyngeal mucosa. Whether this is also true for human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal tumors is not clear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multistep carcinogenesis &ndash; SCCHNs result from a multistep process with defined intermediate stages, leading to fully transformed, invasive, and metastatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>Standard options for managing oral dysplasia, a precursor of invasive cancer, range from watchful waiting to biopsy, laser surgery, and aggressive resection. However, none of these approaches is of clear clinical benefit. Other approaches to decreasing the incidence of invasive tumor growth in patients with recognizable premalignant lesions have fallen into several categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of further carcinogenic exposures (eg, tobacco, alcohol). This strategy is important, but it may not be sufficient since many or most of the critical genetic alterations leading to transformation have already occurred in &quot;early&quot; premalignant lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck squamous cell carcinogenesis: Molecular and genetic alterations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemoprevention or pharmacologic intervention to reverse or inhibit carcinogenic progression. Chemoprevention can be considered in two settings: primary chemoprevention in individuals with de novo premalignant lesions and secondary chemoprevention in patients who have undergone potentially curative therapy in order to prevent recurrent disease or second primary tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening individuals known to be at high risk for the development of invasive cancer based upon the presence of risk factors or premalignant lesions in a target population. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Field carcinogenesis and chemoprevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SCCHN (from environmental carcinogens as opposed to HPV) have a global predilection for the development of cancer throughout the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal mucosa. The concept of field carcinogenesis was initially proposed in the 1950s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Subsequent studies confirmed that patients with cancer or premalignant dysplastic lesions in the oral mucosa are at significant risk for the development of head and neck cancer at noncontiguous mucosal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The presence of such a field defect has precluded the routine use of surgical resection of premalignant disease as a curative approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This field defect is attributed to carcinogenic exposure from risk factors (eg, tobacco and alcohol) throughout the entire oropharyngeal mucosa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Field carcinogenesis is supported by both epidemiologic and molecular studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer at one site in the head and neck is a strong predictor for the development of a second primary tumor elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Second tumors can either occur at or close to the same time as the primary lesion (synchronous) or six months or more later (metachronous). Synchronous second tumors are often occult lesions in the upper aerodigestive tract discovered during the initial staging evaluation, whereas metachronous second tumors most often involve other sites in the head and neck region or elsewhere in the upper aerodigestive tract (lung, esophagus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Incidence of second and multiple primaries'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecular analyses have often demonstrated that first and second lesions are clonally distinct, ruling out locoregional recurrence as a universal explanation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in some cases, physically distinct mucosal tumors may share a common origin, suggesting that genetically abnormal precursor cells have the capacity to migrate extensively within the mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Histologically normal mucosa in patients with head and neck cancer may contain evidence of genetically abnormal cells at discrete sites not contiguous with the known cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This may in large part explain the failure of surgical excision of grossly evident dysplastic lesions to substantially reduce the risk of cancer in patients with premalignant lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Surrogate markers and potential target agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of chemoprevention is to decrease the number of cancers that develop in the anatomic area at risk. Direct demonstration of a decreased incidence of cancer requires that very large numbers of patients be followed over long periods of time. Thus, there has been interest in defining alternative surrogate endpoints to both evaluate the efficacy of chemopreventive therapies and to serve as molecular prognostic factors for risk stratification in chemoprevention trials.</p><p>The accurate identification of lesions with carcinogenic potential is critical to chemopreventive studies. Grossly evident lesions that may be precancerous include leukoplakia (white plaques) and erythroplakia (red plaques). Standard histologic assessment alone of these lesions lacks adequate specificity and sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Histologic criteria in noninvasive dysplastic lesions that have been suggested to correlate with progressive carcinogenic potential include the degree of nuclear atypia, failure of organized differentiation, loss of cell-cell contacts, the presence of keratotic bodies, and the cellular DNA content. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Genetic definitions of progressive premalignant stages are being defined. Histologic progression has been correlated with sequential clonal genomic alterations, including deletions of chromosome arms 3p, 9p, 11q, and 17p [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. A number of tumor suppressor genes thought to be critical in tumorigenesis have been mapped within these regions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck squamous cell carcinogenesis: Molecular and genetic alterations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many of these genomic alterations have in turn been associated with abnormal expression of a number of proteins that may hold promise as potential intermediate endpoints and molecular prognostic factors for chemoprevention studies. The reversal of molecular alterations that are tightly linked to the development of oral cancer (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], transforming growth factor alpha [TGFA] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], p53 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], telomerase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and retinoic acid receptor beta [RARB] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]) might indicate a reduced risk of oral cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, folate deficiency has also been linked to a higher risk of developing SCCHN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. A deficiency in folate seems to disrupt gene methylation as well as DNA structure. Genes that may be affected include tumor suppressor genes such as p16 and possibly p53 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Genetic polymorphisms in folate metabolism have also been associated with clinical characteristics that may increase the risk of SCCHN, such as advanced age, tobacco and alcohol use, and male gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> may be exerting its chemopreventive role by inhibiting proliferation of mucosal epithelium. This process has been associated with a decreased concentration of EGFR in other tumor types, such as colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, SCCHNs clearly express folate receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Furthermore, a pretreatment elevated intake of dietary folate was suggested as an independent prognostic factor for improved clinical outcomes in SCCHN patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Folate is therefore an interesting natural compound worth exploring in chemopreventive studies of the head and neck. </p><p>Other nutritional compounds of possible interest in chemoprevention include zinc. A mild deficiency of zinc was observed in 25 percent of the normal healthy volunteers and 48 percent of the head and neck cancer subjects, raising the possibility that zinc deficiency might contribute to the development of SCCHN. This has been explained by the possible dysfunction of type 1 T helper (TH1) cells, as evidenced by decreased production of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon gamma in zinc-deficient head and neck cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There is, however, no clear evidence for a clinical benefit from zinc supplementation in the chemoprevention of SCCHN.</p><p>Despite the interest in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> as a possible chemopreventive agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], there is insufficient evidence to suggest a benefit for selenium supplementation in the prevention or prognosis of SCCHN. </p><p>Studies have suggested that soy supplementation has anticancer properties, and soy has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In addition, Bowman-Birk inhibitor is a protease inhibitor derived from soybeans that has demonstrated chemopreventive activity and has been tested in patients with oral leukoplakia with evidence of clinical benefit in 31 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. There is, however, currently no conclusive evidence to support the use of genistein, a soy derivative, to prevent SCCHN or improve its prognosis. Studies investigating the properties of genistein as an antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic agent in SCCHN are underway. </p><p>At least some data suggest that expression of podoplanin, a lymphatic endothelial marker whose biologic roles are incompletely understood, might be a powerful predictive factor for oral cancer development in patients with leukoplakia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These data were derived from a randomized chemoprevention trial comparing 13-cis-retinoic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> plus retinyl palmitate, and retinyl palmitate alone in 163 patients with oral leukoplakia. High levels of podoplanin expression by immunohistochemistry were associated with a significantly higher incidence of oral cancer (five-year risk 37 versus 8 percent in those with podoplanin-negative lesions). Risk could be further stratified by combining histology (the presence or absence of dysplasia) with podoplanin expression.</p><p>Which factors are useful predictors of carcinogenic progression and which molecular abnormalities best predict reduction in subsequent cancer risk when normalized remain unclear. In addition, a complete histologic response in premalignant lesions may be seen following administration of a chemopreventive agent in patients despite the persistence of chromosomal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1055378701\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral cancer occurs in sites that are generally accessible by physical examination. Thus, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) has great potential for prevention through routine mouth examinations in high-risk individuals to detect premalignant or early malignant lesions, as well as through dissemination of anti-tobacco health education information.</p><p>The challenge with conducting screening studies is in identifying the high-risk group, the appropriate intervention or screening test, the duration of screening initiative, and the health outcome of interest. The quality of a screening program is affected by participation rate, test performance (sensitivity and specificity), frequency of screening, participant compliance, and duration of follow-up of positive test results. Screening initiatives have been undertaken in industrialized and developing countries:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Cuba, the Oral Cancer Case Finding Program (OCCFP) was based upon health education and thorough examination of the oral cavity by &quot;stomatologists&quot; in specialized stomatology centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Between 1983 and 1990, over 10 million patients were examined, 30,478 were referred for detected abnormalities, and 8259 complied with their referral. In the last group, 2367 leukoplakias, 853 other precancerous lesions, and 708 malignant neoplasms were diagnosed. The potential efficacy of this program is evident by an increased incidence of stage I oral cancers (from 22 to 48 percent) and the reduced incidence of more-advanced (stages II to IV) cancers (from 77 to 52 percent). However, these health outcome measures are subject to the potential influences of both &quot;length bias&quot; and &quot;lead time bias.&quot; A reduction in population mortality would be a more appropriate surrogate measure of the effectiveness of the screening method.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An impact of screening on reduced mortality from oral cancer was suggested in a trial from India in which seven population clusters (municipal administrative units) were randomly assigned to three rounds of oral visual inspection by trained health workers at three-year intervals; six were assigned to a control group receiving standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Eligibility was open to healthy patients over the age of 35. Screen-positive patients were subsequently referred for clinical examination, biopsy, and treatment. In the intervention group, there were 205 cases of oral cancer and 77 oral cancer deaths; in the control group, the values were 158 cases and 87 deaths, respectively, but the difference in mortality was not statistically significant (mortality rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.51-1.22). Notably, only 3218 of the 5145 individuals who screened positive complied with referral. Among users of alcohol, tobacco, or both, there was a significant 33 percent reduction in the risk of oral cancer death (mortality rate ratio 0.66). The authors concluded from these findings that the use of oral visual screening in high-risk groups of tobacco <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alcohol users was potentially capable of preventing at least 37,000 oral cancer deaths worldwide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In studies involving over 250,000 subjects in Sri Lanka, primary health care workers detected a total of 44 new oral cancers. However, mortality was not reduced in these areas, possibly due to poor compliance following initial screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study in the United States, screening for squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx with symptom assessment and systematic inspection of the oral mucosa was performed by primary care practitioners at health care sites serving inner-city residents of Boston [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Of the 4611 tobacco users older than 40 years who were screened, 313 had specific criteria for otolaryngologic referral. The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions and persistent hoarseness was 13 and 11 percent, respectively. Abnormal findings were seen in over 70 percent of referred patients, and cancer was diagnosed in 3 percent.</p><p/><p>These studies have demonstrated that a primary care screening strategy for head and neck cancer can reach a large number of at-risk individuals and that early detection and treatment may reduce overall mortality. Whether or not any of these strategies are cost-effective is not known. Currently, there is no effective oral cancer screening program, although screening high-risk individuals in developing countries could be an effective prevention strategy.</p><p>Future screening strategies based upon detection of molecular abnormalities (eg, promoter hypermethylation) in body fluids such as serum and saliva may hold some promise, but this technology is not ready for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMOPREVENTION TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No chemopreventive agents have been shown to decrease the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in adequately powered randomized clinical trials.</p><p>Patients suitable for a chemoprevention trial may have a documented precancerous lesion or have a known risk factor for developing malignancy without having a premalignant lesion.

The challenges facing chemoprevention in this group are the lack of a clearly defined precancerous lesion and the lack of clear risk stratification that would clearly identify the subjects who might benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>Most of the completed chemoprevention trials for premalignant lesions of the oral cavity and oropharynx have studied either naturally occurring compounds (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>) or synthetically derived retinoids.

This process leads to driving the mucosal cells into S phase and induces cellular DNA synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,119</a>].</p><p>Studies using oral rinses and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV DNA have identified 7 percent of the adult population with active oral HPV infection, but only approximately 3 percent of men and 1 percent of women have high-risk HPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>], and this group could form a target for chemoprevention. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1055378966\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of HPV related oropharyngeal carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The improvement in overall survival for patients with SCCHN has been unfortunately linked specifically to the increased incidence of HPV related oropharyngeal carcinomas rather than early intervention or detection of disease. The high prevalence of HPV related oral infection and the increase in HPV related cancers call for chemopreventive measures to these malignancies.</p><p>HPV vaccines are effective in preventing HPV related malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/121-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-124</a>]. Despite this, the use of these vaccines is relatively limited at the present. The value of HPV vaccination in reducing the risk of oral HPV infection has not been established. </p><p>There has been an interest in exploring whether a &quot;Pap test equivalent&quot; would be useful for early detection of HPV related oropharyngeal carcinoma. Cytologic abnormalities in addition to the presence of HPV 16 were strong predictors of the occurrence of oropharyngeal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. There has also been no clear association between HPV infection and cytologic abnormalities in the oral mucosa, raising the question as to whether HPV infection leads to a precancerous lesion that would precede the occurrence of invasive oropharyngeal carcinoma. The problem may also reside in the location rather than the existence of these lesions in HPV positive disease, which if occurring in the lower part of the tonsillar crypts, would pose difficulty in both detection and monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the advances with surrogate markers in premalignant lesions that can assess the risk of developing invasive carcinoma, there is no established approach for chemoprevention of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). </p><p>Trials with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and newer targeted agents are ongoing. Data from one trial suggested that EGFR blockade with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> alone could result in durable complete and histological resolution of moderate to severe dysplasia in a subset of high-risk premalignant lesions. However, this observation needs to be validated in larger trials. However, a larger phase III trial with the EGFR inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a> failed to identify any decrease in cancer incidence compared with placebo. Current interest is focusing on natural compounds in light of their preclinical activity as well as their low toxicity profile.</p><p>The strong predictive power of podoplanin analysis, particularly in conjunction with histology, may help to guide future therapeutic trials in this field by focusing therapy on those patients at highest risk of progression to invasive cancer.</p><p>Molecular carcinogenesis models of upper aerodigestive tract malignancy have generated a number of new potential targets for intervention in cancer progression. A second generation of chemopreventive strategies based upon known genetic defects in premalignant disease is warranted. In light of the increased incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) related oropharyngeal carcinoma, efforts should be targeting towards prevention of this disease.
