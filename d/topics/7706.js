Studies of twins and of families of asthmatic individuals have shown that asthma occurs in a pattern consistent with heritable factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. There are clearly components of the asthma phenotype that appear strongly heritable, although these inherited components do not follow the simple Mendelian pattern that is seen in monogenic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, and the specific genes responsible for these inherited components have yet to be identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-genetic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of genetic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The genetics of asthma will be reviewed here; epidemiology and risk factors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ISSUES IN STUDYING ASTHMA GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human and animal data currently suggest that the syndrome of asthma is likely transmitted by multiple genes. In addition, different genes in different individuals may lead to the same phenotype (locus heterogeneity), and multiple genes acting in the same individual (oligogenic or polygenic inheritance) may culminate in expression of the asthma phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Some genes may influence the development of asthma, while others modify asthma severity or the patient's response to therapy. Finally, interactions between genetic factors and environmental influences provide another layer of complexity.</p><p>Exploration of the genetics of asthma has also been hampered by the fact that there is no &quot;gold standard&quot; diagnostic test for asthma, and the clinical diagnosis is inconsistently applied. To circumvent these issues, investigators have studied the distribution of asthma-related traits, including bronchial hyperresponsiveness and measures of atopy (eg, total serum IgE levels, skin test reactivity), in addition to the presence or absence of an asthma diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

The technology used to perform a genome-wide linkage study resulted from the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the 1980s, whereby DNA fragments in the human genome could be amplified and then studied for variable fragment lengths of repeats, or &ldquo;genetic fingerprinting.&rdquo; With a catalog of microsatellite markers spanning the human genome, genome-wide linkage studies emerged as a robust approach for identifying genetic &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; associated with complex traits such as asthma. A genome-wide linkage approach could be used for screening and was often followed by positional cloning, in which fine mapping was performed using additional markers in and around a locus of interest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the current technologies used in asthma genetic studies, more than twenty linkage studies were performed for asthma and asthma-related traits, identifying at least 10 regions as containing candidate genes potentially related to asthma, including dipeptidyl peptidase X (<em>DPP10</em>), localized on chromosome 2q14 in the interleukin-1 (IL-1) gene cluster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 33&rdquo; (<em>ADAM33</em>), localized on chromosome 20p13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>], an orphan G protein-coupled receptor named GPRA (G protein-coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility ) on chromosome 7p [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and protocadherin-1 gene (<em>PCDH1</em>) on chromosome 5q31-q33 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Unfortunately, the successful identification of candidate genes from linkage studies was limited, and linkage of the implicated loci with other traits of asthma was not always possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Although six novel genes were eventually discovered using positional cloning (ie, follow-up studies on linkage loci), none of these loci have been replicated by genome wide association studies (GWAS). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Association studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the publication of initial efforts in sequencing the human genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>], the opportunity to genotype markers directly in genes of interest was greatly expanded, facilitating genetic association studies. Association studies determine the relationship between certain disease characteristics and the presence of specific forms (referred to as alleles) of a particular DNA marker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Millions of polymorphisms (ie, substitutions, deletions, insertions) have been identified in the approximately 20,000 to 25,000 genes across the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up the human DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Allelic association studies can be performed by genotyping these polymorphisms in unrelated individuals (cases versus controls) or in families of affected individuals (in which non-transmitted alleles are compared to transmitted alleles). Allelic association studies have provided additional evidence supporting the role of several candidate gene regions in asthma.</p><p>Prior to its retirement in 2014, the Genetic Association Database (GAD), a public archive of published gene-based genetic association studies available online, summarized data from over 500 published genetic association studies on asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For asthma alone, literally hundreds of candidate genes have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/7,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14,15</a>], representing the relative success of this approach. Many of the DNA markers that have been used in linkage and association studies are of uncertain functional significance, although genetic variants with known in vitro biochemical effects have also been examined. Some of the most highly replicated genes (and in some cases, functional variants) are the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Filaggrin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two loss-of-function null mutations R501X and 2282del4 in the epithelial barrier gene, filaggrin (FLG), represent the most replicated genetic risk factors for atopic dermatitis (AD). Association studies suggest that filaggrin may also be asthma-related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]; however, distinguishing associations of FLG variants with asthma from susceptibility to AD or severity of diseases associated with AD has been challenging and remains unresolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">ORMDL3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ORMDL3, which encodes a transmembrane protein linked to the endoplasmic reticulum, lies in a cluster of genes on chromosome 17q <span class=\"nowrap\">(ZPBP2/GSDMB/ORMDL3)</span>. The first asthma genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed a reproducible association between childhood onset asthma and markers in this locus (p&lt;10[-12]) among European populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This association has been widely replicated in several European ancestry samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-26</a>], as well as Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>] and Hispanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gene encoding the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) is situated on chromosome 5q31 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The protein is a member of the large family of G-protein coupled, seven transmembrane-spanning domain receptors. It is expressed on a variety of cell types in the lung, including airway smooth muscle and epithelial cells, vascular endothelium, and inflammatory cells such as mast cells, eosinophils, and lymphocytes.</p><p>Genetic variations in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene are associated with differential in vivo airway hyperresponsiveness and in vitro responses to beta agonist stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. As examples, individuals who are homozygous for the Gly16 form of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene have attenuated responses and more rapid tachyphylaxis to adrenergic bronchodilator medications than do those with the wild type, homozygous Arg16 form of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>The clinical significance of identified beta-2 adrenergic receptor polymorphisms remains unclear. There is evidence for beta-2 adrenergic receptor dysfunction in nocturnal asthma, and polymorphic forms of the receptor are associated with IgE variability; however, polymorphisms do <strong>NOT</strong> increase the risk of developing asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/34,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36-38</a>]. Further study may clarify the precise role of beta receptor dysfunction in the genesis and course of asthma. At present, beta-2 adrenergic receptor polymorphisms cannot explain the presence or absence of clinical asthma, nor can these polymorphisms be used as reliable predictors of clinical response to beta-2 agonist therapy for asthma management.

In vitro studies demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals heterozygous for the mutant allele had a two-fold elevation in the expression of CD23 (the low affinity IgE receptor) in response to IL-4, while individuals homozygous for the mutant allele had a three-fold elevation in CD23 expression in response to IL-4. These results have been extensively replicated in other populations and in family-based association studies (which are not susceptible to false positive associations based upon population stratification) both for asthma and for associated phenotypes such as elevated total serum IgE and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/11,40-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,40-46</a>].

Among the many GWAS for asthma, several candidate genes have been consistently associated across multiple populations and are described below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first asthma GWAS, performed by the European GABRIEL consortium, showed a reproducible association between childhood onset asthma and markers near the <em>ORMDL3</em> gene on chromosome 17q21 (p&lt;10[-12]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'ORMDL3'</a> above). The ORMDL3 locus was similarly one of the strongest associations for asthma in the United States-based, meta-analysis of a GWAS of ethnically diverse North American populations, called the EVE Consortium, which performed a meta-analysis of asthma in populations of European, African, and Hispanic ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. However, the SNPs significantly associated in the discovery population were<strong> not</strong> associated among African Americans in several independent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/19,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,70,71</a>], supporting the argument that European-associated (and European-<strong>selected</strong>) SNPs do not adequately tag common causal variants relevant for non-European individuals. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To compound the challenge, the ORMDL3 locus is within a 300-kb region that includes a dozen genes of wide-ranging functions, and three of these genes, gasdermin B (GSDMB), IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (Aiolos [IKZF3]), and zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2), are in tight LD with ORMDL3, which has complicated identification of the true causal variant(s) driving association in the 17q21 locus. In an eQTL study, SNPs associated with asthma in a subset of the GABRIEL sample were consistently and strongly associated (P&lt;10<sup>-22</sup>) with transcript levels of <em>ORMDL3 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and a separate study identified polymorphisms in a putative promoter region of ORMDL3 which altered transcriptional regulation of the gene and correlated with changes in TH2 cytokine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], shedding light on its potential role in asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an expanded GWAS by the European-based <em>GABRIEL </em>Consortium (10,365 individuals with physician-diagnosed asthma and 16,110 unaffected individuals), five genes in addition to the ORMDL3 locus were strongly associated with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], of which two, interleukin-33 (IL-33) and the chromosome 2 locus IL-1 receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">like1/IL-18</span> receptor1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(IL-1RL1/IL-18R1),</span> were replicated in the EVE Consortium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In an independent GWAS on eosinophil counts in 9000+ Icelanders, <em>IL33 </em>and<em> IL1RL1 </em>SNPs were similarly strongly associated with asthma, but atopic asthma, not non-atopic asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. <em>IL33 </em>is a relatively new member of the IL-1 family that induces Th2 cytokines, and its receptor, ST2, exists as membrane and circulating soluble protein. IL-33, initially described for its role in expulsion of <em>Trichuris muris</em> from the gut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], is produced by mast cells following IgE-mediated activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

A single TSLP SNP (rs1837253) identified as protective against risk for allergy, asthma, and airway hyperresponsiveness, but not in linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs in the TSLP locus, influences TSLP secretion from primary nasal epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

Linkage analysis performed with the progeny of crosses between a highly responsive strain and a relatively unresponsive strain identified three regions of the mouse genome linked to the phenotypic trait of airway hyperresponsiveness. However, no specific genetic determinants have yet been identified with such animal models.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ETHNIC DIVERSITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of asthma genetics have not adequately sampled the diverse human populations afflicted with asthma. One review revealed that genetic studies in white populations (ie, of northern and western European ancestry) represented 60 percent of the association studies reported from 1987 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; conversely, there were only 25 studies (3 percent) of African-based populations and 41 studies of Hispanic populations. These minority populations are clearly under represented, despite the fact that they suffer disproportionately from asthma morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/39,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,87,88</a>].</p><p>Certain allelic variants in allergic response candidate genes are more common in people of non-European descent. Also, the &ldquo;wild type&rdquo; allele, rather than the variant, confers risk of the trait in some cases. As an example, the functional variant T allele at position -260 in the CD14 gene has been associated with lower total IgE levels and less severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/4,10,47-50,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,47-50,53</a>]. In contrast, a functional polymorphism leading to lack of expression of Duffy <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/receptor</span> for chemokines (DARC) appears to increase susceptibility to asthma and atopy among certain populations of African descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>Replication of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings in non-European groups has been limited, supporting the notion that certain genes (or polymorphisms in those genes) may be unique to different ethnic groups. For example, as described above, associations in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the ORMDL3 gene reported in the first asthma GWAS have been widely replicated in several ethnically diverse populations. However, the SNPs significantly associated in the discovery population (European), and replicated by other groups, were not significantly associated with asthma in several independent African-American populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/19,23,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23,70</a>]. These studies suggest that polymorphisms may explain, at least in part, the marked disparities observed in risk for allergic asthma in certain populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concordance rates for atopy among monozygotic twins raised together are only 50 to 60 percent, suggesting that differences in exposure to certain environmental triggers may account for some of the disparity of disease expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In a study of asthma and allergic rhinitis among 3808 pairs of Australian twins, about 40 percent of the genetic liability for both diseases was due to environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Elsewhere, it has been demonstrated that genes and the environment contribute approximately equally to asthma and associated traits such as total IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The marked increase in asthma prevalence over the past century supports the role of unknown environmental factors.</p><p>Added to the complexity is the observation that associations with alleles at candidate genes and interactions between these genes might only be observed among certain subpopulations with nearly identical environmental and genetic backgrounds. As an example, an association between the glycoprotein CD14(-260)C&gt;T variant (chromosome locus 5q23-31) and low total IgE was noted in school children living in <span class=\"nowrap\">urban/suburban</span> Tucson, AZ; however, the opposite association was reported in a farming community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/4,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,93</a>]. In other studies, the association of asthma with CD14(-260)C&gt;T was influenced by pet exposure, the dose of endotoxin in the domestic environment, or country living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/10,94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,94,95</a>], suggesting that the unusual role that endotoxin exposure plays in asthma may be due to a unique combination of susceptibility genes and the degree of exposure to endotoxin.</p><p>Certain alleles may have divergent effects depending on environmental exposures. In a study of 983 children, single nucleotide polymorphisms related to ORMDL3 and GSDMB at chromosome locus 17q21 were associated with decreased risk of asthma by age six among children exposed to farm animals, but increased risk of asthma among those with an older sibling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'ORMDL3'</a> above.)</p><p>Environmental tobacco exposure has been shown to affect the extent to which significant associations are observed between candidate gene variants and asthma and atopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/51,94,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,94,97,98</a>]. The interaction of early life tobacco smoke exposure and certain genetic variants to increase asthma risk was demonstrated in a study of 372 families with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 17q21 region increased the risk of early-onset asthma and this risk was further increased by early life tobacco smoke exposure.</p><p>Certain SNPs in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) gene were associated with increased airway responsiveness and increased asthma exacerbation rates in cohorts of Costa Rican and non-Hispanic white children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. In this study, high dust mite exposure further increased the likelihood of asthma exacerbations among patients with alleles of two SNPs (rs2241712 and rs1800471).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16001407\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIGENETICS AND THE INHERITANCE OF ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epigenetics (chemical reactions that switch parts of the genome on and off) is thought to be one of the mechanisms by which the environment interacts with the genome to cause changes in gene expression (ie, heritable changes in gene expression due to non-coding changes to the DNA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. As an example, DNA methylation, a covalent (reversible) modification of DNA in which a methyl group is transferred from S-adenosylmethionine to cytosine residues at cytosine-guanine (CG) dinucleotides by DNA-methyltransferases, is associated with reduced gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-epigenetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of epigenetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several observations suggest epigenetics may be involved in pathogenesis of asthma. First, the concordance rate in monozygotic twins of only approximately 50 percent argues for non-genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/90,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,103</a>]. Second, complex gene-environment interactions are involved in asthma, which could reflect epigenetic genome modifications. Interactions have been observed between maternal smoking during pregnancy and markers, such as interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) with a significant increase in risk of asthma in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Conversely, in utero exposure to rural environments (ie, endotoxin exposure) seems to have protective effects against the development of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>]. Third, sex-specific differences exist, where the prevalence of asthma is higher in boys during prepuberty, but highest among girls after puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Also, a parent-of-origin effect exists in susceptibility to asthma and elevated total serum IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>] with a clear difference in risk to offspring of asthmatic mothers compared to asthmatic fathers, raising the possibility that imprinted genes may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/109-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">109-113</a>]. Finally, a number of genetic studies of asthma have reported linkage and association in clusters of related genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>], which suggests a higher order, epigenetic level of gene regulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been considered to be the most common (approximately 10 million distinct SNPs) among all possible forms of genetic variation in the human genome (ie, 10 or more types of DNA variants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/115,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,116</a>]. However, advancements in array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and high-density oligonucleotide microarray technologies have provided evidence of duplications in genomic sequences, also known as copy number variants (CNV). Representing deletions and duplications of DNA segments ranging in size from 1000 bases (1 kb) to 3 Mb, CNVs occur at relatively high frequencies in human populations and may cover at least 2 percent of the genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/117-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">117-120</a>]. In the context of nucleotide coverage, CNVs likely affect more of the human genome than SNPs.</p><p>The relevance of CNVs in asthma is evident from associations between the 15-kb deletion spanning the GSTM1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,122</a>] and other deletion polymorphisms in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/121-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-124</a>]. With the placement of CNVs on high-throughput genotyping platforms, including genome-wide association study (GWAS) platforms, it is anticipated that more associations will be forthcoming.</p><p>Another promising technique is to combine genome-wide association SNP data with genome-wide expression data; this allows examination of differentially expressed genes as quantitative phenotypes, referred to as &ldquo;genetical genomics.&rdquo; Large numbers of genotypes, provided by genotyping microarrays such as those used in GWAS, are then combined with linkage analysis to locate areas of the genome controlling gene expression. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are identified as markers associated with gene expression. Cis and trans-acting expression eQTLs can be classified based on the location of the mRNA transcript compared to the eQTL that influences expression of the transcript. An eQTL in the same bin (or region) as the transcript is classified as cis-acting, and an eQTL in a different bin as trans-acting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. By using this eQTL approach, it is possible to determine the extent of variation in gene expression close to the genes that show genetic variation. As an example, the validity of the GWAS findings regarding ORMDL3 was confirmed using eQTL; markers associated with asthma were also strongly associated (P&lt;10[-22]) in cis with transcript levels of ORMDL3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/18,126\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,126</a>]. This is the first demonstration of eQTL for asthma genes.</p><p>Sequencing of coding exons and corresponding flanking regions of candidate asthma genes may identify rare variants that are overlooked by genome-wide association studies. Rare gene variants may have a substantial role in susceptibility to asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>] and may also explain variation in responses to bronchodilator medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>]. The emergence of massively parallel, second-generation DNA sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>] has made resequencing an affordable tool to study genetic variation in specific regions and may also help in the discovery of new genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-asthma/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is a syndrome that is passed down through families in complex patterns. There are clearly components of the asthma phenotype that are heritable, although the genes responsible for these inherited components have yet to be identified. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma may arise from different genes in different individuals leading to the same phenotype, multiple genes acting in the same individual to produce the phenotype, and complex interactions between environmental factors and a patient's underlying genetics. In addition, there may be asthma pathogenesis genes, asthma severity modifying genes, and asthma treatment modifying genes. The role of epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of asthma has not been widely studied, but several observations suggest that epigenetics is likely to be involved. The study of asthma genetics is further complicated by the lack of a &quot;gold standard&quot; diagnostic test for asthma. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Issues in studying asthma genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three main strategies currently used to identify the genetic factors that predispose to the development of asthma are linkage analysis in families with asthma, case-control or family-based association studies, and animal models of asthma traits. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetic techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Linkage analysis is a statistical technique used to identify regions of the genome that cosegregate during meiosis with a postulated disease gene. A small number of candidate genes of uncertain function have been identified by linkage analysis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Linkage analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Association studies determine the relationship between certain disease characteristics and the presence of specific alleles of a particular DNA marker. Using this technique, genes that encode the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADR2) and the interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor have been identified as possibly important. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Association studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain groups of people, such as African-ancestry and Hispanic populations, have been underrepresented in asthma genetics research, despite the fact that they suffer disproportionately from asthma morbidity and mortality.
