Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important to reduce the risk of both short- and long-term complications. However, even with timely treatment and clinical improvement in symptoms, long-term sequelae frequently occur; this is thought to be secondary to the scarring and adhesion formation that accompany healing of infection-damaged tissues. These sequelae &mdash; chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy &mdash; account for much of the morbidity, suffering, and cost of PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One group estimated that a cohort of 100,000 females acquiring PID between 20 and 24 years of age would go on to have 18,600 cases of chronic pelvic pain; 16,800 cases of infertility; and 8550 ectopic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Long-term complications of PID will be reviewed here; other issues related to this disorder are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pathogenesis, microbiology, and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21129257\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT PID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a history of PID are at increased risk of recurrence. As an example, a study of primarily low income African American women with mild-moderate PID found that 15 percent reported a recurrence within 35 months and 21 percent reported a recurrence within 84 months. In the adjusted analysis, adolescents were 50 percent more likely than adult women to experience a recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other populations may have lower or higher recurrence risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HYDROSALPINX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After PID resolves, the damaged fallopian tube can become blocked, fill with sterile fluid, and become enlarged. Damage to the fallopian tube from previous surgery or adhesions can also result in hydrosalpinx. </p><p>Hydrosalpinx may be associated with pain or may be asymptomatic except for tubal factor infertility. </p><p>Hydrosalpinx in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) has negative consequences on the rates of pregnancy, implantation, early pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and live delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pelvic pain is defined as menstrual or non-menstrual pain of at least six months' duration that occurs below the umbilicus and is severe enough to cause functional disability. As many as one-third of women with PID develop chronic pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. While the precise etiology is unknown, the pain may result from scarring and adhesions that develop from inflammation related to the infectious process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;, section on 'Pelvic inflammatory disease'</a>.)</p><p>A study of risk factors for chronic pelvic pain in women with symptoms and signs of PID found recurrent PID was the strongest predictor for the development of this type of pain (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% CI 1.07-7.54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other risk factors included non-black race, married status, smoking, and poor mental health score.</p><p>A case-control study identified a correlation between a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and painful bladder syndrome (OR 3.69, 95% CI 2.89-4.71), suggesting that painful bladder syndrome may be a sequelae of PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome#H28423492\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INFERTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both symptomatic and asymptomatic PID can cause permanent injury to the fallopian tube, especially the endosalpinx. Changes to the fallopian tube, including loss of ciliary action, fibrosis, and occlusion, lead to tubal infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There may be additional mechanisms of infertility, as well. </p><p>Subclinical PID, defined as histologic endometritis with no symptoms of acute PID, appears to decrease subsequent fertility, even in patients who are treated for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and bacterial vaginosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Treatment of cervicitis without endometritis does not appear to have this effect. </p><p>The prevalence of infertility after acute PID depends upon multiple factors (discussed below), but appears to be increased several-fold. This was illustrated by a prospective cohort study of 2501 Swedish women with suspected PID who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and were followed for as long as 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among women desiring pregnancy, 16 percent of those with laparoscopically-confirmed PID (group 1) and 2.7 percent of those with normal laparoscopic findings (group 2) failed to conceive. Tubal factor accounted for 67.6 percent of infertility diagnoses, but was not a cause of infertility in any woman in group 2.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chlamydial infection</strong> &mdash; Among the microorganisms that cause PID, Chlamydia trachomatis appears to carry the greatest risk of infertility. Approximately one in four women with tubal factor infertility seeking care in an infertility clinic has serum antibodies to C. trachomatis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and serum titers of C. trachomatis antibodies correlate inversely with pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In one study, the pregnancy rates in women with the highest and lowest titers were 59 and 73 percent, respectively, seven years post-infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These data suggest that infertility after PID may result, at least in part, from the host&rsquo;s immune response to chlamydial infection. A high titer may be associated with a greater inflammatory response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delay in seeking care for PID</strong> &mdash; In one study, women with PID who delayed seeking treatment for three or more days were threefold more likely to be diagnosed with infertility than women who sought care in a timely manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In women with chlamydial infection, 17.8 percent of those who delayed seeking care had impaired fertility, whereas none of those who sought care promptly suffered sequelae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increasing number of PID episodes</strong> &mdash; A classic review found that pregnancy rates after one, two, or three or more episodes of PID were 89, 77, and 46 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severity of infection</strong> &mdash; The cumulative proportions of women achieving a livebirth after mild, moderate, and severe PID were 90, 82, and 57 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ECTOPIC PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tubal damage caused by PID increases the risk of tubal pregnancy, as well as infertility. The increased expression of certain proteins involved in implantation may play a role in the pathophysiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Epidemiology, risk factors, and anatomic sites&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the prospective Swedish cohort study discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], the incidence of ectopic pregnancy in the first pregnancy after laparoscopically-confirmed PID was 7.8 percent versus 1.3 percent in women without PID at laparoscopy. The risk of ectopic pregnancy increased with the number of episodes and severity of PID:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After one, two, and three episodes of PID, the ratio of ectopic pregnancy to intrauterine pregnancy was 1:15, 1:6, and 1:3, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In women with a single episode of mild, moderate, or severe PID, the ratio of ectopic pregnancy to intrauterine pregnancy was 1:35, 1:25, and 1:5, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12435232\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARIAN CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A population-based, case-controlled study from Taiwan reported that a history of PID was associated with an almost two-fold increase in the risk of ovarian cancer (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.27-2.92), with the highest risk in women with multiple episodes of PID (HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.48-4.09 for women who had at least five episodes of PID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Additional studies have reported similar associations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. It is not known whether PID is an independent risk factor for ovarian cancer, as PID increases the risk of low parity, nulliparity, nulligravidity, and infertility, which are also risk factors for ovarian cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTION AND PREVENTION OF LONG-TERM SEQUELAE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms associated with acute PID are poor predictors of the eventual development of chronic sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Furthermore, clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microbiologic cure of acute disease does not preclude development of the long-term complications described above. Therefore, clinicians should not assume that women with a complete recovery from PID have avoided the increased risk of long-term complications.</p><p>As discussed above, recurrent PID is associated with an almost two-fold increase in infertility and more than four-fold increase in chronic pelvic pain; therefore, prevention of recurrent disease is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/9,18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,25</a>]. Options to reduce the risk of recurrence include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Condoms</strong> &ndash; Women whose partners consistently use condoms are less likely to develop recurrent PID or infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, condom use protects against acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, and in the PEACH trial, women with PID who subsequently acquired a lower genital tract infection were 2.3 times more likely to develop chronic pelvic pain than those who did not (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-3.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Progestins</strong> &ndash; Progestin-based contraceptives may decrease the risk of PID because progestin thickens cervical mucus, thereby possibly providing an enhanced barrier against ascending infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral contraceptive pills</strong> &ndash; The protective role of oral contraceptives in the acquisition of PID is controversial; some studies found the use of oral contraceptives conferred a protective effect against the development of chlamydial PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], while others did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3641507583\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
