It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes, which are usually monoclonal in origin.</p><p>CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), one of the indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of small lymphocytic lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of CLL will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, molecular biology, cytogenetic abnormalities, and treatment of CLL are discussed elsewhere.

The disorder is more common in men, with a male to female ratio of approximately 1.3:1 to 1.7:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The incidence rates among men and women in the United States are approximately 6.75 and 3.65 cases per 100,000 population per year, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In Europe, these incidence rates are 5.87 and 4.01 cases per 100,000 population per year, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Worldwide, there are approximately 191,000 cases and 61,000 deaths per year attributed to CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>CLL is considered to be mainly a disease of older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of approximately 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; however, it is not unusual to make this diagnosis in younger individuals from 30 to 39 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence increases rapidly with increasing age. It is estimated that 20,940 new cases of CLL will be diagnosed in the United States in 2018: 12,990 in males and 7,950 in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The incidence of CLL varies by race and geographic location. In the United States, there is a higher incidence among Caucasians as compared with African Americans or Asian Pacific Islanders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The incidence of CLL is extremely low in Asian countries such as China and Japan, where it is estimated to occur at a frequency that is approximately 10 percent of that seen in Western countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. The incidence of CLL in Africa is not as low as it is in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Genetic rather than environmental factors are the most likely explanation for these differences. A genetic effect on incidence was initially suggested by observational studies that have shown that Japanese who settled in Hawaii do not have a higher incidence of CLL than native Japanese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Further support for a genetic effect was provided by a genotyping study in African Americans that demonstrated that this population had a lower frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with an increased incidence of CLL in other populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Furthermore, the cytogenetic and molecular genetic characteristics of CLL appear to be similar throughout the world, although one study suggests that the clinical course may be more aggressive in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>There are no clearly discernible occupational or environmental risk factors that predispose to CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Although there has been an increase in all other types of leukemias among atomic bomb survivors, there has been no increase in the incidence of CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In addition, despite a few reports of an excess risk of CLL among farmers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], those with benzene and heavy solvent exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/18-20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20,23,24</a>], rubber manufacturing workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], or those with multiple episodes of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], these associations have not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602942821\"><span class=\"h2\">Family studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CLL and other lymphoid, hematologic, and solid tumors occur with higher than expected frequency among first-degree family members of patients with CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. In addition, one study demonstrated that up to 17 percent of first-degree family members of patients with CLL were found by flow cytometry to have monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Of note, while virtually all cases of CLL are preceded by MBL, only a small percentage of persons with MBL will ultimately develop CLL. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A study of multi-generational familial cases of CLL noted that the median ages at onset in the child (51 years) and parent generations (72 years) were significantly different (ie, genetic anticipation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although there is no available proof of genetic transmission of this disease, certain genetic polymorphisms may predispose patients to familial cancer, including CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. DNA analysis in a set of monozygotic twins with CLL suggested that the transforming events in CLL occur late in life and result, even in monozygotic twins, in genetically distinct malignant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>A number of candidate chromosomal regions are currently being explored for the presence of susceptibility genes for familial CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/32,41-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,41-46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602942827\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602942833\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CLL may have a wide range of symptoms and physical and laboratory abnormalities at the time of diagnosis. Some patients consult a physician because they have noted painless swelling of lymph nodes, often in the cervical area, which spontaneously wax and wane, but do not altogether disappear.</p><p>Most patients feel entirely well with no symptoms when a routine blood count reveals an absolute lymphocytosis, leading to a diagnosis of CLL. Five to 10 percent of patients present with the typical &quot;B&quot; symptoms of lymphoma which include one or more of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unintentional weight loss &ge;10 percent of body weight within the previous six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fevers of &gt;100.5&deg;F (&gt;38&deg;C) for &ge;2 weeks without evidence of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drenching night sweats without evidence of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme fatigue (ie, ECOG Performance status 2 or worse; cannot work or unable to perform usual activities) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Occasionally, the presenting features are those of an acquired immunodeficiency disorder, manifested by infections, autoimmune complications such as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia or pure red cell aplasia, or exaggerated reactions to insect stings or bites (especially mosquito).

Lymph node enlargement may be generalized or localized, and individual lymph nodes can vary greatly in size. The most commonly affected sites are cervical, supraclavicular, and axillary.</p><p>Characteristically, enlarged nodes in CLL are firm, rounded, discrete, nontender, and freely mobile upon palpation. Exceptions to these generalizations are encountered, particularly when the nodes have grown rapidly. Occasionally, several enlarged nodes in the same anatomical site (eg, cervical triangle, axilla or femoral-inguinal areas) may become confluent, forming large spherical lymphoid masses. In addition, new lymph nodes may appear in places other than the usual lymph node-bearing sites, such as over the sacrum or the thorax.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602942851\"><span class=\"h3\">Splenomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spleen is the second most frequently enlarged lymphoid organ, being palpably enlarged in 25 to 55 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. As is the case with enlarged lymph nodes, an enlarged spleen in CLL is usually painless and nontender to palpation, with a sharp edge and a smooth firm surface. Painful and infarcted splenic enlargement is an unusual presenting feature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602942857\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enlargement of the liver may be noted at the time of initial diagnosis in 15 to 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The liver is usually only mildly enlarged, ranging from 2 to 6 cm below the right costal margin, with a span of dullness to percussion of approximately 10 to 16 cm. Upon palpation, the liver is usually nontender and firm with a smooth surface.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602942863\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infiltration with CLL cells may occur in any organ, but, at the time of diagnosis, the skin (leukemia cutis) is the most commonly involved non-lymphoid organ. These lesions most commonly involve the face and can manifest as macules, papules, plaques, nodules, ulcers, or blisters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Diagnosis is made based upon biopsy of the involved skin. Leukemia cutis is seen in fewer than 5 percent of cases and may not significantly affect overall prognosis unless they represent foci of Richter's transformation.

An exaggerated reaction to insect bites, especially mosquito bites, has been reported, and may alert the clinician to the diagnosis of CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602942875\"><span class=\"h3\">Other organ involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually any lymphoid tissue may be enlarged at diagnosis, including Waldeyer's ring in the pharynx.

Sometimes, in a given biopsy sample, one may see a mixture of nodular and interstitial, or nodular and diffuse infiltrative, patterns. Historically, patients with diffuse infiltration tend to have advanced disease and a poorer prognosis, whereas, for prognostic purposes, nodular and interstitial patterns may be grouped together in the prognostically better &quot;non-diffuse&quot; category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].

With this system, patients with an absolute B lymphocyte count (B-ALC) less than <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> and an ALC more than <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> represented an overlap between CLL and monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis.

However, blood lymphocytosis may also occur with non-neoplastic conditions, such as viral or other infections (eg, infectious mononucleosis, pertussis, toxoplasmosis), as well as in neoplastic conditions other than CLL (eg, the leukemic phase of lymphomas, hairy cell leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, and large granular cell lymphocyte leukemia).

In addition, unlike in CLL, a lymphocytosis does not occur in the bone marrow of patients with these infectious causes of lymphocytosis.

The disorder is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CLL is the most common leukemia in Western countries, accounting for approximately 30 percent of all leukemias in the United States. It has a male predominance and is more common in Caucasians. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years. There are no clearly discernible occupational or environmental risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H602942815\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vast majority of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis and only come to the physician's attention based upon abnormalities found on routine blood counts. Alternatively, some patients may present with painless swelling of lymph nodes, often in the cervical area, which spontaneously wax and wane, but do not altogether disappear. Less common presentations include constitutional &quot;B&quot; symptoms of lymphoma, symptoms related to an acquired immunodeficiency, or autoimmune complications. (See <a href=\"#H602942827\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly are the most common findings on physical examination at the time of diagnosis. CLL cells may infiltrate and disrupt the function of any organ. At the time of diagnosis, the skin (leukemia cutis) is the most commonly involved non-lymphoid organ. Gastrointestinal mucosal involvement and meningeal leukemia are rare. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is seen on occasion. (See <a href=\"#H602942839\" class=\"local\">'Signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with CLL have a prominent lymphocytosis in the peripheral blood and bone marrow at diagnosis. Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia may also be observed at the time of initial diagnosis, and are usually of relatively mild degree. These can be related to autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Other laboratory abnormalities at presentation may include hypo- and hypergammaglobulinemia. The peripheral blood smear demonstrates a lymphocytosis. The circulating leukemic cells typically resemble small, mature lymphocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96498\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96498 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97705\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97705 \">picture 2</a>), but a proportion of circulating cells may be comprised of prolymphocytes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Morphology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunophenotypic analysis reveals a clonal population (kappa or lambda light chain) of cells that express B cell associated antigens (CD19, CD20, and CD23), the T cell associated antigen CD5, and low levels of surface immunoglobulin. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Immunophenotype'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a bone marrow examination is performed at the time of initial diagnosis, it usually demonstrates normal to increased cellularity, with lymphocytes accounting for &gt;30 percent of all nucleated cells. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histopathologic lymph node findings in SLL and CLL are identical and consist of a diffusely effaced nodal architecture with an infiltrate composed of mostly mature-appearing, small lymphocytes, with an admixture of prolymphocytes and paraimmunoblasts. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CLL is made based upon the results of a complete blood count with differential and flow cytometry of the peripheral blood to determine the immunophenotype of circulating lymphocytes. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of CLL includes both non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions that result in a lymphocytosis in the peripheral blood. These include infectious causes of lymphocytosis, prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma (leukemic phase), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, follicular lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and monoclonal B lymphocytosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90133\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90133 \">table 2</a>).
