Proteinuria increases in approximately one-half of cases, and hypertension develops or worsens in approximately one-quarter of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Severe hypertension can occur, potentially leading to maternal injury, premature delivery, or poor fetal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Marked worsening of edema also can be seen in women with the nephrotic syndrome. These changes generally resolve after delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal function may decline as a result of pregnancy among patients with renal disease, determined in part by the severity of underlying renal disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy is associated with a permanent decline in renal function in between 0 and 10 percent of women when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is initially normal or only mildly reduced (plasma creatinine concentration &lt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 132 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/2-4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,7</a>]. Other patients may experience a transient decline in renal function during pregnancy. One study, for example, evaluated 360 women with chronic glomerulonephritis and normal renal function: 171 became pregnant, while the remainder did not conceive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. After follow-up for as long as 30 years, there was no difference in renal survival between the two groups. Patients with hypertension were much more likely to develop progressive disease independent of pregnancy status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcome may be different in women with moderate renal insufficiency (plasma creatinine concentration between 1.5 and 2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 132 and 255 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. In this setting, the plasma creatinine concentration tends to decline modestly during the first half of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and then may rise above the previous baseline as the pregnancy progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One study, for example, evaluated 76 pregnant women with an initial mean plasma creatinine concentration of 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (168 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L);</span> the creatinine concentration increased to a mean of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (223 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> by the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among those with an initial value between 1.4 and 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (124 and 168 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> the risk of a decline in kidney function was approximately 40 percent. Women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may experience an irreversible decline in GFR that is greater than predicted based upon the patient's previous course. Several small studies suggest that as many as one-third experience an irreversible decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/7,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,12</a>], and, in the previously mentioned study of 76 women, 10 percent progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by 12 months postpartum; among eight patients, seven had a decline in renal function during pregnancy, and one had stable renal function before and immediately after pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The risk of acceleration was highest (33 versus 2 percent) among those with an initial plasma creatinine concentration above 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. The risk of an irreversible loss of GFR may exceed 50 percent in patients who also have uncontrolled hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of eight cohort studies with 1268 CKD patients with well-preserved kidney function at baseline demonstrated that there was a high rate of pregnancy complications including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and growth-restricted babies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the data on baseline renal function were suboptimal, and it appears that most patients in these studies had normal renal function despite albuminuria. Thus, the authors' findings that women with CKD did not have an increased risk of worsening kidney function during or after pregnancy are consistent with the recommendations of most guidelines that, with normal baseline renal function, most women will not experience worsening kidney function during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We believe that the authors&rsquo; conclusion that &quot;pregnancy was not a risk factor for progression of renal disease in women with CKD before pregnancy&quot; is misleading since, in women with reduced renal function, pregnancy increases risk for progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The issues are somewhat different in women with a baseline plasma creatinine concentration above 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (265 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. These women frequently have amenorrhea or anovulatory menstrual cycles. Thus, the likelihood of conception and then carrying the fetus to term is low; however, contraception is advisable because of poor pregnancy outcomes with advanced CKD. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive and sexual dysfunction in uremic women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>In summary, an elevated plasma creatinine concentration (above 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 132 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and hypertension are the major risk factors for permanent exacerbation of underlying renal disease. It has been proposed that the type of disease also may be important as accelerated progression may be more likely in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and reflux nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/3,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,15</a>]. However, most investigators have found that etiology (other than lupus nephritis) is probably not a major determinant of worsening renal disease, if factored for pre-existent renal insufficiency and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/12,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,16</a>]. Women with vesicoureteral reflux may be at increased risk for urinary tract infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Lupus nephritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The negative prognostic implications of pre-existing hypertension and azotemia in pregnancy discussed above also apply to lupus patients.

It has been suggested that a biopsy may be performed if there is a sudden, unexplained deterioration in renal function or markedly symptomatic nephrotic syndrome occurring before 32 weeks gestation. Biopsy after week 32 is not recommended; among such patients, we defer biopsy until after delivery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF KIDNEY DISEASE ON PREGNANCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy in mild to moderate chronic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of pre-existent renal disease on the course of pregnancy is somewhat better established. The rate of live births is above 90 percent in women with normal renal function and lower with modest chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/2,6,7,12,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7,12,16,18</a>]. Data demonstrate increased rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth) in pregnant women with stage 1 CKD (defined as kidney damage and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In a meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies, pregnant women with pre-existing renal impairment were significantly more likely to develop gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, or to die (12 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Maternal mortality was more frequent in those with CKD (4 versus 1 percent), although this was not statistically significant. In a meta-analysis of nine studies, the preeclampsia odds ratio (OR) was 10.36 in women with CKD compared with women without CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preeclampsia may be more difficult to diagnose in women with CKD who already have hypertension and proteinuria. However, features of the preeclamptic syndrome may include significant worsening of hypertension and proteinuria, in association with a decreased platelet count or increased liver enzymes. Although this syndrome generally occurs in the third trimester, women with underlying renal disease are at greater risk for second-trimester preeclampsia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal outcomes are also worse in women with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/7,11,16,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,16,20-22</a>]. In one meta-analysis, the frequency of preterm birth was significantly higher among women with renal impairment (13 versus 6 percent), while nonsignificantly higher rates were noted for intrauterine growth restriction (5 versus 0 percent), small for gestational age (14 versus 8 percent), and stillbirth (5 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a second meta-analysis, compared with women without CKD, the risks of pregnancy failure, premature birth, cesarean section, and small for gestational <span class=\"nowrap\">age/low</span> birth weight were higher in CKD patients, with ORs of 1.8, 5.72, 2.67, and 4.85, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fetal survival is lower when hypertension is uncontrolled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/7,16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16,21</a>].

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and some immunosuppressive drugs (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>) should be discontinued at the earliest indication of pregnancy. In addition, women who are not pregnant but are of childbearing age should be warned about the potential consequences of these agents.

Among women suspected of being pregnant who have elevated serum beta-hCG, ultrasonography should be performed to verify the presence of a viable fetus and to obtain the approximate gestational age.</p><p>The reported frequency of conception among women of childbearing age on dialysis ranges from 0.3 to 1.5 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although fetal wastage is markedly increased when pregnancy occurs, improvements in management have resulted in an enhanced frequency of live births (40 to 86 percent of all pregnancies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/21,23-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23-32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one survey of 1281 women of childbearing age undergoing maintenance dialysis, for example, 1.5 percent became pregnant in a two-year period; since 1990, 52 percent of these pregnancies resulted in surviving infants, a much better result than in earlier years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two other large surveys in Belgium (1472 women of childbearing age) and in United States dialysis clinics (6230 women) noted successful outcomes in 50 and 40 percent of pregnancies, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

Among all reported pregnancies, 53 were conceived after the initiation of dialysis, whereas 24 were conceived before dialysis was started. The live birth rate was higher for women who conceived before starting dialysis compared with those who conceived after initiation (91 versus 63 percent, respectively), even though all women remained on long-term renal replacement therapy. The improved outcome among such women may have been due to higher residual renal function, which often declines with time on dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analysis of a Canadian cohort of 22 pregnancies treated with intensified hemodialysis revealed a live birth rate of 86.4 percent and a mean duration of pregnancy of 36 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Although the recommended weight gain in the second and third trimesters is between 0.3 to 0.5 kg per week, it is difficult to distinguish excess fluid gained between dialysis sessions from that due to pregnancy-associated weight gain.

Potential explanations include infertility consequent on chronic illness, undiagnosed comorbidities, and patients choosing to use effective birth control options.</p><p>In addition to an increased risk of fetal loss, the frequency of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and premature delivery are elevated in transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis that included 4706 pregnancies in 3570 kidney transplant recipients, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and preterm delivery occurred in 27, 8, and 46 percent of patients, respectively, compared with approximately 4, 4, and 13 percent in the general United States population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of 105 pregnancies in 101 transplant recipients who were identified through the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System, 52 percent delivered at &lt;37 weeks compared with the national rate in the UK of 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Twenty-four percent of infants were small for gestational age (defined as &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile). Preeclampsia developed in 24 percent of transplant recipients compared with 4 percent in a comparison group (women who delivered in the same hospital around the same time as the transplant recipient). There was no increase in gestational diabetes among transplant recipients compared with the comparison group.</p><p/><p>Pregnancy usually has no important early effect on renal function in this setting and is limited by the same factors described above in women with any underlying renal disease: a plasma creatinine concentration above 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (132 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and hypertension that cannot be easily controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/36,41,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,41,47</a>]. In the study from the UK that is cited above, a poor pregnancy outcome was predicted by more than one previous kidney transplant, first trimester serum creatinine &gt;1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (125 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> and diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg in the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The long-term effect of pregnancy on renal function is less clear. Data are largely based on retrospective small studies with somewhat conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. In one of the largest, best designed studies, the long-term outcomes of 39 women who became pregnant with a functioning allograft were each compared with three matched control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. At the end of follow-up of 15 years, allograft and patient survival were similar in both groups (72 and 85 percent in pregnant women versus 69 and 79 percent in the control group, respectively). In addition, kidney function was similar at 1, 5, and 10 years posttransplant. This suggests that pregnancy does not have long-term adverse effects on survival of either the allograft or patient.</p><p>Women are usually advised to wait at least one year after living-related-donor transplantation and two years after deceased transplantation to avoid complications arising from immunotherapy and rejection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs in rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>).

The obstetrician should review operative notes from the transplant procedure to confirm location of the allograft and ureter. A renal ultrasound might also aid in precise location. This information should be placed in the prenatal record to guide the surgeon if a Cesarean delivery is performed. Prophylactic antibiotics and careful wound closure are warranted to avoid complications in these immunocompromised patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is not established in pregnancy, although it has been extensively used in this setting.

There were four babies with malformations but no consistent pattern of anatomic abnormality. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics are altered during pregnancy. Although measured trough levels may be lower, the unbound fraction may be higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Additional information is needed to clarify whether adjustment of tacrolimus dose in pregnancy is appropriate if levels decrease. We do not necessarily increase the dose if levels drop in stable patients; however, we follow levels closely.</p><p>As with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> require frequent monitoring of renal function and drug levels.
