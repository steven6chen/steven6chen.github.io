The optimal frequency of monitoring is unknown. It is reasonable to measure phosphate and calcium levels approximately every one to three months and PTH levels every three to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All of these levels may be assessed more frequently (ie, monthly) in response to changes in therapeutic measures that affect these levels.</p><p>Many clinicians measure vitamin D concentrations yearly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1608619523\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all dialysis patients, we suggest the following guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum levels of phosphate should be maintained between 3.5 and 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.13 to 1.78 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum levels of corrected total calcium should be maintained &lt;9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&lt;2.37 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) values should be maintained less than two to nine times the upper limit for the PTH assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]</p><p/><p>These targets are consistent with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines suggest that, in dialysis patients, elevated phosphate levels should be lowered toward the normal range; however, a specific target level is not given. We believe that clearer guidance is needed.</p><p>A phosphate level of 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is a reasonable inflection point at which increased mortality has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In one study that included 6797 hemodialysis patients, the relative mortality risk adjusted for multiple variables was 1.34 for patients with serum phosphate &gt;5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> compared with those with phosphate 3.6 to 5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>There are no studies that have conclusively shown that outcomes are improved by treatment-related reduction of phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

We measure vitamin D concentrations yearly. All of these levels may be assessed more frequently in response to changes in therapeutic measures that affect these levels. (See <a href=\"#H1336499202\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We treat hyperphosphatemia (serum phosphate &gt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> prior to treating hyperphosphatemia. Observational studies have suggested increased mortality at serum phosphate values above this value. (See <a href=\"#H3065667719\" class=\"local\">'Treat hyperphosphatemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treating PTH values that are more than two to nine times the upper limit for the PTH assay (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Studies have suggested that the high-turnover bone disorders are associated with serum levels of PTH &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (ie, approximately six times upper limit of normal of 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>.

(See <a href=\"#H1608619523\" class=\"local\">'Treatment goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for increased PTH include calcimimetics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a>, or synthetic vitamin D analogs. A combination of calcimimetics with calcitriol or synthetic vitamin D analogs may also be used. All approaches reduce PTH, but no studies have shown a benefit on patient-centered outcomes.
