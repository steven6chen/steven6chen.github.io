Mild to moderate depression can typically be managed in outpatient or partial hospital settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe</strong> &ndash; Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>), as indicated by a score &ge;20 points on the Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine Item (PHQ-9) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 2</a>). Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, and often manifest poor judgement that places the patient and others (including children) at risk for imminent harm. In addition, patients with severe depression can develop complications such as psychotic features and catatonic features, and often have a history of severe or recurrent depressive episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-antenatal-unipolar-depression-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-antenatal-unipolar-depression-treatment/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p/><p>Difficulties may arise in determining the number of depressive symptoms that are present during pregnancy because changes in appetite, energy, and sleep may due to depression, or may represent normal pregnancy-related changes. The presence of these somatic symptoms should be evaluated in the context of normal expectations for pregnancy. As an example, although food aversions can occur during pregnancy, patients with anorexia who fail to gain weight may have mild to moderate depression, and pregnant patients with anorexia who lose weight may have severe depression. In the same vein, pregnancy can cause fatigue. However, lack of energy to the point that patients need to make a significant effort to initiate or maintain usual daily activities can be a mild to moderate depressive symptom, and anergia to the point that patients cannot get out of bed for hours is probably a symptom of severe depression. Persistent uncertainty as to whether an episode of major depression is mild to moderate or severe can be resolved by referral to a psychiatrist (preferably one specializing in perinatal disorders).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2771112199\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general principles and issues that are involved in treating unipolar major depression during pregnancy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of prior treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educating patients and families</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adherence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribing antidepressants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Managing nonresponse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making referrals</p><p/><p>These general principles are discussed in detail separately.

Patients generally start with initial therapy and progress through each step until they respond. The best evidence supports using a structured psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy as the primary treatment. However, many patients receive antidepressant medications. All patients should receive psychoeducation about depression as part of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment#H3770101926\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in pregnant women: General principles of treatment&quot;, section on 'Educating patients and families'</a>.) </p><p>It is important assess the benefit of previous treatment in order to guide treatment selection. If psychotherapy is indicated and the patient was successfully treated with a particular psychotherapy prior to pregnancy, the same therapy generally is used during pregnancy. Similarly, if pharmacotherapy is indicated and the patient was successfully treated with a particular antidepressant prior to pregnancy, the same drug is typically used during pregnancy. </p><p>Continuation treatment is generally indicated for patients who respond to acute treatment of unipolar major depression, and additional maintenance treatment is indicated for patients with an increased risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Continuation and maintenance treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H682789545\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For mild to moderate episodes of antenatal unipolar major depression, we recommend a structured psychotherapy (eg, CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy) as first-line treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-antenatal-unipolar-depression-treatment/abstract/1,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-12</a>]. Psychotherapies developed outside of the antenatal context typically require modification for use in pregnant patients. &#160;</p><p>Administering structured psychotherapy as first-line treatment of mild to moderate antenatal depression is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines, including those from the American Psychiatric Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-antenatal-unipolar-depression-treatment/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. In addition, pregnant women typically prefer psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-antenatal-unipolar-depression-treatment/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Evidence supporting the use of psychotherapy includes numerous randomized trials that found psychotherapy was efficacious in the general population of adults with depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment#H21696474\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Efficacy of psychotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, randomized trials in patients with prenatal major depression support using structured psychotherapies (see <a href=\"#H524225473\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3610218989\" class=\"local\">'Interpersonal psychotherapy'</a> below). However, many of the studies have limitations, which include diagnosing major depression with self-report questionnaires rather than clinical interviews, and the failure to adequately blind outcome ratings. In addition, some trials lack active comparators to control for the nonspecific aspects (eg, attention) of psychotherapy, and instead use less rigorous comparators such as usual care or waiting lists.</p><p>Antidepressant medication is a reasonable alternative to structured psychotherapy for mild to moderate episodes of antenatal unipolar major depression if [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-antenatal-unipolar-depression-treatment/abstract/4,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotherapy is not available or acceptable to patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients prefer pharmacotherapy (eg, they previously responded well to antidepressants)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients have a past history of severe depression (mild to moderate depression can progress in severity) (see <a href=\"#H3082779280\" class=\"local\">'Severity of illness'</a> above)</p><p/><p>Choosing an antidepressant is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment#H87155478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe antenatal unipolar major depression: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Initial treatment'</a>.)</p><p>When treating mild to moderate antenatal depression with structured psychotherapy, we typically choose either CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy. We use CBT in patients with prominent symptoms of anxiety, and prefer interpersonal psychotherapy if the depressive syndrome occurs in the context of role disputes, role transitions, or grief. Both therapies have demonstrated efficacy in randomized trials in patients with perinatal depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-antenatal-unipolar-depression-treatment/abstract/1,10,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,20</a>]. In addition, these two therapies have been more widely studied than other psychotherapies in the general population of patients with depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment#H432086984\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Selecting a specific psychotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Structured psychotherapy for unipolar major depression is usually time limited (eg, 6 to 10 sessions); thus, patients treated with CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy generally receive a full course of therapy, regardless if nonresponse persists through the middle phases of treatment. </p><p>Mild episodes of antenatal major depression are characterized by only five depressive symptoms, the absence of suicidal ideation, and minimal impairment of functioning. For these patients, supportive psychotherapy is a reasonable alternative to CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, and antidepressants. Supportive psychotherapy treats depression by improving self-esteem, psychological functioning, and adaptive skills; the therapy focuses upon current, problematic relationships and maladaptive patterns of behavior and emotional responses. Evidence supporting the use of supportive psychotherapy includes randomized trials in the general population of patients with depression. In addition, an eight-week randomized trial compared omega-3 fatty acids plus supportive psychotherapy (six sessions, each lasting 30 minutes) with placebo plus supportive psychotherapy in women with antenatal depression (n = 21) or postpartum depression (n = 30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-antenatal-unipolar-depression-treatment/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The benefit of omega-3 fatty acids and placebo were comparable; across both treatment groups (n = 51), remission occurred in 31 percent. The administration and efficacy of supportive psychotherapy in the general population of patients with depression are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-supportive-psychotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Supportive psychotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other alternatives for patients with mild antenatal depression include low intensity approaches such as bright light therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">exercise/yoga,</span> massage therapy, omega-3 fatty acids, and peer support. (See <a href=\"#H4034583167\" class=\"local\">'Other options'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>In addition, reasonable alternatives to structured psychotherapy and antidepressants for patients with mild episodes of major depression include clinician guided self-help approaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment#H21696541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinician-guided self-help'</a>.)</p><p>It is also reasonable to manage mild episodes of antenatal major depression with watchful waiting and frequent monitoring (eg, weekly). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H524225473\"><span class=\"h4\">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for major depression combines cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy. Cognitive therapy attempts to modify dysfunctional thoughts and illness beliefs; one technique is cognitive restructuring, which involves reframing distorted thoughts (eg, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good&rdquo;) by empirically testing them and considering more benign explanations. Behavioral therapy aims to change problematic behaviors that occur in response to dysfunctional thoughts, depressive symptoms, and environmental stimuli; specific techniques include behavioral activation (counteracting inertia and avoidance by assigning rewarding activities for patients to complete between treatment sessions), problem solving (identifying the problem, generating multiple solutions, considering the consequences of each solution, choosing one solution, and acting upon it), progressive muscle relaxation, abdominal breathing exercises, and physical exercise. &#160;</p><p>The use of CBT is based upon many randomized trials in the general population of patients with depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-antenatal-unipolar-depression-treatment/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

The administration of interpersonal psychotherapy for unipolar depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpersonal-psychotherapy-ipt-for-depressed-adults-specific-interventions-and-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for depressed adults: Specific interventions and techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy includes numerous randomized trials in the general population of patients with unipolar major depression.

Patients with mild to moderate illness do not manifest suicidal behavior or obvious impairment of functioning, are less likely to develop complications such as psychotic features, and can typically be managed in outpatient or partial hospital settings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms. Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, and often manifest poor judgement that places the patient and others at risk for imminent harm. In addition, patients with severe depression can develop complications such as psychotic features, and often have a history of severe or recurrent depressive episodes. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization.
