Doctors also call it &quot;CMV.&quot;</p><p>CMV is very common. Many people have the virus without knowing it. Some people don't get sick when they have it, but others do.</p><p>CMV can cause serious illness in people with conditions that weaken the body's infection-fighting system (called the &quot;immune system&quot;). These conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An organ transplant, such as a new kidney or lung</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stem cell transplant &ndash; Stem cells are special cells that can turn into many different types of cells. For transplant, they can be taken from bone marrow or blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV &ndash; This is the virus that causes AIDS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being sick in the hospital for a long time, especially in the intensive care unit (also called the &quot;ICU&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being born early &ndash; Babies who are born early (&quot;premature&quot;) are at risk, especially if they are very small.</p><p/><p>CMV can be very serious for people with these conditions. It can even be life-threatening.</p><p>Babies can also get CMV when they are in their mother's womb. This is called &quot;congenital CMV.&quot; Babies with congenital CMV can have serious health problems, such as hearing or vision loss, having a small head and brain, or being smaller than normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8432712\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of CMV?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people who have the virus do not have symptoms. If symptoms happen, they are usually mild in people with healthy immune systems. People with weak immune systems can have more severe symptoms.</p><p>The most common symptom of CMV is an illness called &quot;mononucleosis&quot; or &quot;mono.&quot; But CMV is not always the cause of mono. A doctor or nurse can tell if CMV is the cause.</p><p>Common symptoms of mono from CMV include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen glands in the neck &ndash; This is more common in children than adults.</p><p/><p>Less common CMV symptoms can happen in specific parts of the body. These symptoms are more likely to happen in people with weak immune systems. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digestive system problems, such as diarrhea and belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung problems, such as trouble breathing and dry cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the liver, eyes, nervous system, or heart</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8432727\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are several tests, but you probably will not need all of them. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of fluid from your lungs or other part of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of tissue from an affected body part</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8432744\"><span class=\"h1\">How is CMV treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with healthy immune systems who get sick with CMV do not usually need treatment. They usually feel better in a few days or weeks. Medicines like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can relieve mild symptoms of CMV. If you take these medicines, be sure to follow the directions on the label.</p><p>Doctors can treat severe CMV symptoms with medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ganciclovir</a> (brand name: Cytovene). Ganciclovir is given through a thin tube called an &quot;IV.&quot; The tube goes into a vein. Ganciclovir is usually given to people with CMV who have weak immune systems.</p><p>When a person gets an organ transplant, doctors might give a pill, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">valganciclovir</a> (brand name: Valcyte), to help prevent CMV. Some people with CMV symptoms get this medicine instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ganciclovir</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8432759\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tell your doctor or nurse if you have a fever, sore throat, and body aches. He or she might do a blood test to check for CMV. You might also have the test if you have a condition that weakens your immune system. This is because you can give the CMV infection to your unborn baby.</p><p>CMV can cause serious health problems in some newborn babies, so it is important to know if you have it. That way, doctors can look for problems in the baby and treat them if they happen. Problems can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with learning and growing</p><p/><p>Most people don't know if they have CMV or not. But if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant, it's a good idea to do things that reduce your chances of getting it, just in case. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid kissing toddlers and children on the mouth.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sharing eating or drinking utensils, drinks, or food with toddlers or young children.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands well after changing diapers or wiping a child's nose or face.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid having sex if your partner is sick with a CMV infection. CMV can be spread by sex.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8432774\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mononucleosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mononucleosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=swollen-neck-nodes-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Swollen neck nodes in children (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-mono-in-adults-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Infectious mononucleosis (mono) in adults and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sore throat in adults (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
