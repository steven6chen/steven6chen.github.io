A number of less common adverse events have also been described including cardiopulmonary complications, contrast allergy, impaction of a retrieval basket, and numerous other events reported in only small numbers of patients or individual case reports. These unusual adverse events, which may be difficult to manage, can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus on rare complications of ERCP.

Six of these were cardiopulmonary events, which were fatal in three patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in two Italian prospective series that included a total of 4872 patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

However, the risk is probably increased with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to relatively deep sedation, long duration of the examination, prone position of the patient, advanced age of the patient, and frequent comorbid diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In a database study that included 6092 ERCPs, there were 129 cardiopulmonary events (2.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>As a result, close surveillance of the patient, monitoring of cardiac function and oxygen saturation, aspiration of secretions, administration of flow oxygen when needed, and prompt availability of resuscitation equipment and reversal agents should be part of the routine support during ERCP. Gas embolisms should be considered, among other possibilities, in patients who develop sudden, severe cardiopulmonary events during ERCP.

Nevertheless, a history of sensitivity to iodine contrast or drug should always be considered in the pre-procedure assessment and in the informed consent process.</p><p>In patients with prior allergy to contrast media, prophylactic measures adopted by most endoscopists include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of <span class=\"nowrap\">nonionic/low-osmolarity</span> contrast media.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premedication with oral steroids starting the day before ERCP, or intravenous steroids when allergy is discovered just before the procedure. Some endoscopists also give an intravenous antihistamine in combination with the steroids.</p><p/><p>However, a study of 601 patients who did not receive prophylaxis (including 80 patients with a documented history of reactions to intravascular contrast media) failed to show any adverse reactions associated with the administration of contrast media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROSURGICAL HAZARDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malfunction, incorrect use of electrosurgical equipment and accessories during therapeutic procedures, or defective devices can lead to potentially severe complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography such as perforation, bleeding, and pancreatitis. Other complications reported in case series include fracture of a Teflon-coated guidewire and retroperitoneal perforation following guidewire-assisted sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and rupture of a metal biliary endoprosthesis following electrocoagulation for tumor ingrowth, a risky maneuver which should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Electrocautery can influence implantable devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators. Although most modern pacemakers are unaffected by electrocautery, cardiac arrhythmias can develop if a monopolar current passes through the pacemaker or the heart. The risk is greater for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators since electrocautery may trigger their activation. As a result, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Technology Assessment Committee recommends that implantable cardioverter-defibrillators be deactivated during endoscopic electrosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTRAVASATION OF CONTRAST MEDIUM INTO THE DUODENAL WALL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extravasation of contrast medium into the duodenal wall surrounding the papilla during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can interfere with cannulation and therapeutic procedures, and thereby is a risk factor for complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, forceful attempts in cannulation with fine taper catheters or stiff guidewires, especially in patients with bile or pancreatic duct stenosis or those undergoing precut sphincterotomy, can cause transmural false passages and injection of contrast into the retroperitoneal space or vascular structures. A case of septic cholangitis was reported after an inadvertent submucosal contrast injection during a diagnostic ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OPACIFICATION OF PORTAL, ARTERIAL, OR LYMPHATIC VESSELS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opacification of the portal vein has been described following sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], needle-knife sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], and cannulation of the accessory papilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, documented cases of portal vein visualization during ERCP were reported in patients with pancreatitis (one from a traumatic inadvertent cannulation of the superior mesenteric vein, and another from a preexisting fistula between a pseudocyst and the portal vein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Two reports described accidental wire-guided cannulation of the portal vein despite the absence of sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Guidewire cannulation of the portal vein via an accessory pancreatic duct has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Accidental cannulation of the hepatic artery following needle-knife sphincterotomy has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Accidental insertion of a plastic pancreatic into the portal vein was reported in a patient who had sustained a blunt abdominal trauma with pancreatic transection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Opacification of the periampullary lymphatic system has also been described following injection of contrast into the pancreatic duct in a patient with pancreatic head carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Filling of portal, arterial, or lymphatic vessels has potential risks, including sepsis, air embolism, bleeding, and thrombosis. Furthermore, failed prompt recognition of contrast in vascular structures may be a source of confusion leading to prolongation of the procedure, thereby further increasing the risk of complications. As an example, an opacified portal vein may be misinterpreted as an incompletely filled bile duct. Insertion of a stent into the portal vein may further worsen the consequences; a case has been reported of placement of an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube in the portal vein, fortunately without subsequent complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a separate case report, a portobiliary fistula complicating endoscopic stenting was reported in a patient with pancreatic cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DUODENAL PNEUMATOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A limited collection of air within the duodenal wall (duodenal pneumatosis) has been observed following needle-knife sphincterotomy in a patient with biliary obstruction from ampullary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gas embolism is largely iatrogenic. In most cases, the embolized gas is air. Air embolism is an uncommon but potentially catastrophic event. Cases of air embolism have been reported following upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, although most described cases have been related to an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/31,37-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,37-83</a>]. In a review including 40 cases of systemic air embolism following an endoscopic procedure, 24 patients (60 percent) underwent ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. </p><p>Possible pathophysiologic mechanisms for air embolism during endoscopy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air insufflated under pressure by the endoscope entering an exposed vessel through a compromised mucosa barrier, either via portal or hepatic veins.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air insufflated entering a previous communication between the biliary system and the circulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air insufflated directly into the hepatic veins while using small diameter endoscopes during intraductal biliary endoscopy.</p><p/><p>There are two categories of air embolism, venous and arterial embolism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A venous air embolism occurs when air passes from the portal vein to the systemic venous circulation through the hepatic veins and then to the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An arterial air embolism occurs when air in the venous system enters the arterial system through a patent foramen ovale or pulmonary arteriovenous shunts; it may also occur in the absence of a shunt if the rate and volume of air entry exceeds the filtering capacity of the lung.</p><p/><p>The true incidence of air embolism is unknown, and many cases are subclinical and thus go unreported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>The table illustrates a series of reported cases of air embolism during ERCP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77515 \">table 1</a>). General observations from the series include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reporting trends &ndash; The number of case reports has increased over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex &ndash; The frequency is similar between men and women. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indication and procedures &ndash; Both benign and malignant diseases, and both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were associated with embolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical presentation &ndash; The clinical presentation depends on the rapidity and amount of air entering the circulation; the reported clinical symptoms are cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic. Both venous and arterial air embolism occurred in half of the cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic tests &ndash; Tests<strong> </strong>that provided supportive evidence were chest and abdominal radiography, cardiac auscultation, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, abdominal and cerebral computed tomography scan, cerebral and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and autopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes &ndash; Death occurred in approximately half of the reported cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risks for air embolism &ndash; Factors associated with air embolism<strong> </strong>include previous biliary interventions, previous liver biopsy, percutaneous or transhepatic cholangiography, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement, using a rendezvous technique for ERCP, blunt or penetrating trauma to the liver, hepatic abscesses, tumors, choledochoscopy, insufflation of air with high pressure, and long procedure duration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A potential area of concern is the increasing use of direct intraductal endoscopy using small caliber endoscopes (eg, cholangioscopy), which may increase the risk of air embolism. Three cases of air embolism during peroral cholangioscopy with slim endoscopes were reported in Europe, and according to the results of a case series, air insufflation for direct cholangioscopy should not be used, though the use of carbon dioxide appears safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, larger studies are needed, and the potential risk of intraductal endoscopy should be weighed carefully before such attempts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differential diagnosis &ndash; Air embolism should be considered in any patient who has sudden onset of cardiopulmonary or neurologic decompensation during an endoscopic procedure. A bedside echocardiogram is a valuable diagnostic aid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment &ndash; Once portal venous air is recognized during ERCP and air embolism is suspected, the procedure should be terminated immediately and the patient should be observed for signs of shock, bleeding, perforation, or sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Together with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it is recommended to place the patient in Trendelenburg and left lateral decubitus position and give adequate oxygen or hyperbaric oxygenation therapy as soon as possible. Air aspiration via central venous catheter could be considered but is very difficult to perform, and the success of appreciable aspiration of air is far from ideal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis &ndash; The patient's survival and functional prognosis depend on rapid diagnosis and treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention &ndash; The clinicians should be aware of this problem and prepared to deal with both common and uncommon adverse events. ERCP should be performed extremely cautiously or not at all in patients who are suspected of having a biliary-vascular fistula. Using carbon dioxide insufflation can reduce the risk of air embolism, and carbon dioxide is recommended, particularly for cholangioscopy. Some authors have recommended deep sedation or even general anesthesia systematically during ERCP, but fatal cases have occurred with anesthesia assistance. The general consensus is that the patient must be carefully monitored by the operator and assistants with the help of electronic monitoring devices.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMORRHAGE FROM SPLENIC, HEPATIC OR VASCULAR TRAUMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemorrhage following endoscopic sphincterotomy usually occurs in the duodenal lumen arising from the actual sphincterotomy site (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) bleeding&quot;</a>). </p><p>However, in rare cases intraperitoneal hemorrhage has been described from injury to the spleen, liver, or abdominal vessels.</p><p>Splenic injury is more commonly caused by colonoscopy, but it has also been reported following ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. Previous abdominal surgery with adhesion formation is recognized as a risk factor; concomitant liver laceration has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>]. The severity of the splenic injury varies from a subcapsular hematoma to the avulsion of splenic vessels. As a result, patients do not always present with shock and acute abdomen, and the injury may be overlooked. As an example, a sub-capsular splenic laceration was diagnosed six days after ERCP in a patient with chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. The diagnosis of a sub-capsular splenic laceration should be suspected in patients who develop the acute onset of left upper quadrant abdominal pain following ERCP. The pain is often delayed and is not always associated with obvious signs of peritoneal irritation, hemodynamic instability, or a drop in the hematocrit. A sub-capsular splenic laceration was diagnosed six days after ERCP in a patient with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

Despite the availability of lithotripsy, cases are still reported. Usually the basket becomes trapped at the ampulla within the intraduodenal portion of the common bile duct. However, impaction above the intrapancreatic portion of the bile duct, in the intrahepatic ducts, in the main pancreatic duct, and even in the gallbladder has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/133-136\" class=\"abstract_t\">133-136</a>].</p><p>The risk for basket trapping is increased with big, irregular shaped and hard stones, or multiple stones, in association with small sphincterotomy size. Other risk factors are distal narrowing of the common bile duct and segmental dilatation of intrahepatic ducts as in Caroli disease.</p><p>Tailoring the sphincterotomy size appropriately and refraining from fully closing the basket around a large stone may prevent entrapment. In addition, prevention of basket impaction requires experience and good judgment in recognizing conditions in which standard techniques of stone extraction are likely to fail and alternative approaches should be considered.</p><p>Once the basket impaction has occurred, the first and common alternative is mechanical lithotripsy. Thus, retrieval baskets should always be suitable for mechanical lithotripsy; baskets that are not designed for lithotripsy can fracture. If mechanical lithotripsy is complicated by fracture of the central traction wire of the Dormia basket without breakage of the stone, a rescue second basket has been successfully used in rare cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-complications-of-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>].
