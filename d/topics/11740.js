The condition is strongly associated with stress, anxiety, and trauma.</p><p>While nightmares are not by definition pathologic, those that are frequent or disabling and impair social, occupational, emotional, and physical wellbeing are considered a disorder and are often a sign of underlying and treatable psychopathology. Common causes include stress, negative life events, the experience of trauma as in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, other psychiatric disorders, and medication side effects.</p><p>This topic reviews the causes, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management of nightmares in adults. Nightmares in children and other parasomnias in children and adults are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleepwalking and other parasomnias in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of arousal from non-rapid eye movement sleep in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3192628235\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true prevalence of nightmares and nightmare disorder is uncertain due to varying terminology and criteria for defining nightmares across studies. Nonetheless, it is clear that the occurrence of an occasional nightmare is common, and that nightmare disorder is much less common, particularly in adults.</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of children report ever having nightmares, and up to 20 percent report having frequent nightmares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 85 percent of adults report having a nightmare at least once a year, and 2 to 6 percent report having frequent (weekly) nightmares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of more than 100 studies found that nightmares are more commonly reported by women than men during adolescence and young adulthood (ratio of approximately 1.5 to 1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. No gender gap was present in younger children or in adults 60 years of age and older. Nightmare content and frequency, like dreams, may also vary across cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2573837199\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nightmares are more prevalent during periods of stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. They can emerge in association with traumatic experiences, as in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and in association with other psychiatric diagnoses, including depression, dissociative disorders, and borderline personality disorder. Medications most commonly associated with nightmares include those that affect norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1645849717\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a history of physical or emotional trauma are at increased risk for nightmares and related symptoms of intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal. Possible clinical disorders include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong> &ndash; Nightmares with recurrent experiences of a past traumatic event are a cardinal feature of PTSD. Additional clinical features include intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, avoidance of reminders of trauma, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance. Nightmares associated with PTSD may occur not only during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep but also at sleep onset, leading to insomnia and severe sleep disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PTSD can be diagnosed based on the presence of a specified number and types of trauma-related symptoms that persist more than 30 days after the traumatic event. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PTSD can occur after many types of trauma, including sexual assault, mass conflict and displacement, combat, and severe medical illnesses or injuries. Individual pre-trauma risk factors include female gender, personal and family psychiatric history, reported childhood abuse, and poor social support.

When frequent, idiopathic nightmares may have high rates of psychopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].<sup> </sup>Individuals with frequent nightmares are more likely to attempt suicide and self-harming behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In patients with depression, alterations in sleep architecture, including shortened REM latencies and increased density of REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], may contribute to the increased rate of dysphoric dreams and nightmares. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep#H630021550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;, section on 'Sleep architecture'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, differentiating nightmares from hallucinations can sometimes be difficult, as both rely on patient report and an accurate perception of a sleep versus waking state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H990365948\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide range of medications have been implicated in generating nightmares (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F114523\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114523 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Of note, the effect of a medication on sleep architecture, and on REM sleep specifically, does not always predict its propensity to cause nightmares. As an example, beta blocker medications tend to decrease REM sleep, but they are commonly associated with nightmares.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antihypertensives</strong> &ndash; In one systematic review, beta blockers accounted for one-third of the reports of nightmares as an adverse effect of medications in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although more common with the lipophilic beta blockers such a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, nightmares can also be seen with hydrophilic beta-blockers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reserpine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Reserpine</a> has also been noted to cause nightmares.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dopamine agonists</strong> &ndash; Dopamine agonists can cause or worsen nightmares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This includes anti-Parkinson drugs such as levodopa, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropinirole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropinirole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> as well as stimulants such as amphetamine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antidepressants</strong> &ndash; Antidepressant medications, although more classically associated with nightmares during medication withdrawal, can also be implicated in causing nightmares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One possible explanation for this effect is that REM sleep, although suppressed, is delayed until later in the night and associated with cholinergic rebound and more intense dream activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antimicrobials</strong> &ndash; Certain antimicrobials have also been implicated in nightmare generation, possibly through modulation of sleep-regulating inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, prostaglandin E2.

This is often the result of a compensatory increase in REM sleep (ie, REM rebound) that occurs when these medications, which suppress REM sleep, are withdrawn.</p><p>Similarly, withdrawal of antidepressant medications, including tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), is commonly associated with increased frequency of nightmares, likely related to REM rebound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2468774579\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic frequent nightmares</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nightmares may occur with increased frequency during times of stress or emotional instability and may disturb the quality and continuity of sleep. Some have proposed that nightmares may initially be about the experience of a stressful event but very soon are replaced by the dominant emotion of the event as a repeating narrative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The theme may be fear followed by guilt and other strong emotions.</p><p>In a Finnish nationwide twin cohort study, monozygotic twins had more similar rates of nightmares than dizygotic twins, suggesting a genetic propensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957278229\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H423383543\"><span class=\"h2\">Nightmares</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nightmares are dysphoric dreams generally arising out of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and less commonly out of N2 sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. They occur more frequently in the last third of the night, when REM sleep predominates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104210\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104210 \">figure 1</a>). One exception is nightmares associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which are equally likely during <span class=\"nowrap\">N1/N2</span> and REM sleep and may occur both early and late in the sleep period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Dream content is typically scary and vivid, with negative themes that result in disturbed, fragmented sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Common themes include failure and helplessness, physical aggression, accidents, being chased, health-related concerns and death, and interpersonal conflicts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Nightmares are often associated with a heightened sense of awareness and increased sympathetic tone as evidenced by palpitations, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, sweating, and symptoms of anxiety and panic upon awakening. Recall of dream content is typically vivid, in contrast with sleep terrors.

One study using ambulatory PSG found no differences in sleep parameters between subjects with frequent nightmares and those without, although subjective sleep quality was worse in the nightmare group, and those with nightmares were more likely to complain of insomnia and daytime dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A second study using in-laboratory PSG found that nightmare sufferers had reduced sleep efficiencies, increased wakefulness after sleep onset, reduced slow wave sleep, and increased nocturnal awakenings, particularly from N2 sleep, compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Limited data suggest that periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) may be more frequent in patients with idiopathic nightmares and nightmares associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Clinical features of nightmares that are helpful in differentiating them from most other sleep-related phenomena include recall of the dysphoric dream, full alertness upon awakening from a nightmare, occurrence generally later in the night when REM is more frequent, and an absence of motor behavior while sleeping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516277656\"><span class=\"h2\">REM sleep behavior disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RBD should be suspected when dreams or nightmares are associated with motor activity or vocalization. During normal dreaming and REM sleep, most of the major muscle groups are paralyzed (atonic), preventing movement. In RBD, there is loss of normal REM-related atonia, resulting in the ability to move and &quot;act out&quot; dreams.</p><p>Physical behaviors in RBD range from minor limb movements and groaning to violent thrashing, punching, and kicking movements associated with injury to the patient or bed partner. Patients often wake up briefly as a result of the movements and recall an unpleasant or threatening dream.</p><p>RBD is most commonly seen in older adults in association with neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease; however, symptoms of RBD may precede cognitive decline and motor disability by a decade or more. In younger patients, RBD may be seen in association with antidepressant medications, narcolepsy, and rarely structural brainstem pathology.

There is increased sympathetic nervous system activity (eg, pupillary dilation, sweating, tachycardia), and individuals appear scared and inconsolable, even though they are not clearly aware of their surroundings.</p><p>Sleep terrors last a few minutes to as long as 30 to 40 minutes, and patients are often amnestic for the events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In contrast with nightmares, which occur during REM sleep, sleep terrors usually occur from N3 sleep (delta, slow wave, or deep sleep) and are noted in the early part of the night, when NREM sleep predominates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104210\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104210 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Sleep terrors are most common in children and are usually benign.

It includes CBT techniques of initially recalling the nightmare and negative event, writing it down with details of emotional sensitivity, reading it, and then modifying the theme.

Several limitations of this trial have been raised as potential explanations for the discrepant results with prior trials, including a high percentage of antidepressant use in both arms and the exclusion of patients with psychosocial instability, which may have excluded more severely affected patients who were most likely to respond to adrenergic blockade.

Occasional nightmares are common, particularly in children. Nightmares decrease in frequency with age and are more commonly reported by women than men in adulthood. (See <a href=\"#H3192628235\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, the most common conditions associated with recurrent nightmares are acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Certain medications and substances can induce or exacerbate nightmares, during either treatment or withdrawal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F114523\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114523 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2573837199\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nightmares that recur with enough frequency and distress to impact nighttime or daytime function may meet criteria for nightmare disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F114290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114290 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2957278229\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of nightmares includes other parasomnias, such as sleep terrors and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and psychiatric disorders such as nocturnal panic attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F114526\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114526 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1298421860\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nightmare disorder is a clinical diagnosis. A comprehensive clinical evaluation aims to differentiate nightmares from mimics, identify causes such as a history of trauma, and assess the impact on physical, social, and emotional functioning. (See <a href=\"#H203067956\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polysomnography (PSG) is not indicated to confirm the diagnosis but may be useful when there is clinical suspicion for a primary sleep disorder such as RBD or obstructive sleep apnea. (See <a href=\"#H203067956\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle modifications that promote good sleep can help to decrease the frequency and severity of nightmares and enhance the overall quality of sleep. Medications that may be triggering nightmares should be reduced or discontinued if possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F114523\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114523 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2400311603\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle modification and good sleep hygiene'</a> above and <a href=\"#H195510507\" class=\"local\">'Withdrawal of causative medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric assessment and treatment of underlying psychiatric disease is recommended in patients with persistent nightmares. Nightmares often improve with successful treatment of the primary psychiatric disorder (eg, anxiety, depression, PTSD). (See <a href=\"#H3688223574\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of co-occurring psychiatric disorders'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments for severe and chronic nightmares include psychotherapy and medication. The choice can be individualized according to patient preferences and access to a therapist. In our experience, the majority of chronic persistent nightmares in adults are related in some way to underlying psychopathology or past trauma, and we encourage patients to engage in psychotherapy prior to or in conjunction with medication. (See <a href=\"#H2991968296\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When psychotherapy is chosen, we suggest imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT), a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). IRT may be most applicable in patients with a recurring nightmare or schema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F114546\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114546 \">table 7</a>); if IRT is not available, more limited data support other forms of CBT tailored to nightmares. (See <a href=\"#H2530293262\" class=\"local\">'Nightmare-focused psychotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When medication is chosen, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prazosin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Prazosin has primarily been studied in patients with PTSD-associated nightmares, and trials in this population have had conflicting results. If there are co-occurring psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety, psychosis, or depression, interventions targeted to these disorders should be initiated prior to consideration of prazosin. (See <a href=\"#H4261530858\" class=\"local\">'Prazosin'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gauchat A, S&eacute;guin JR, Zadra A.
