The cytotoxic agents that are most commonly associated with infusion reactions are the taxanes, platinum drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegylated-liposomal-doxorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegylated liposomal doxorubicin</a>, L-asparaginase, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ixabepilone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ixabepilone</a>. While these are often referred to as &quot;hypersensitivity reactions,&quot; many do not have an allergic component. Thus, the term infusion reaction is preferred.</p><p>After an introductory section that summarizes the characteristics of infusion reactions and different approaches to classifying them, this review will focus on commonly used conventional cytotoxic drugs with a moderate to high incidence of infusion reactions, and the ways in which these reactions can be treated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prevented. Infusion reactions in patients receiving therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment are discussed separately, as are other cutaneous adverse effects associated with chemotherapy.

These represent the majority of reactions to systemic chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis is a distinct reaction that is rare with most conventional cytotoxic agents, although it is well established that the platinum drugs and the taxanes can cause anaphylaxis. The most common signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis caused by intravenously-administered medications are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous symptoms: flushing, itching, urticaria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema (usually of face, eyelids, or lips)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory symptoms: repetitive cough, sudden nasal congestion, shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheeze, sensation of throat closure or choking, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> change in voice quality (due to laryngeal edema), hypoxia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular symptoms: faintness, tachycardia (or less often bradycardia), hypotension, hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of consciousness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuromuscular symptoms: sense of impending doom, tunnel vision, dizziness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seizure, severe back, chest, pelvic pain </p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis (from all causes) are presented in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although there is overlap between the clinical features of anaphylaxis and those of SIRs, certain signs and symptoms are highly suggestive of anaphylaxis, and they should be specifically sought when evaluating a patient with an infusion reaction: urticaria, repetitive cough, wheeze, throat <span class=\"nowrap\">tightness/change</span> in voice, and hypotension. These stereotypical signs and symptoms result from the release of mediators from mast cells and basophils. In contrast, fever and prominent muscular pain are NOT features of anaphylaxis, and the presence of these signs and symptoms suggests the reaction is an SIR.</p><p>It is critical to undress the patient and examine the skin carefully during infusion reactions in order to fully appreciate skin findings, especially urticaria. The neck, trunk, extremities, abdomen, and axillae are the sites where urticaria often appears first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a group, infusion reactions (including both SIRs and anaphylaxis) usually occur during or within a few hours of drug infusion. Occasionally, a reaction may occur one to two days after administration, and patients must be adequately informed of symptoms to watch for and the appropriate course of action to take if a problem arises. Although they most commonly occur with the first or second drug administration, infusion reactions are unpredictable and can occur at any time despite preventive measures.</p><p>Attempts to identify patients who are likely to develop an infusion reaction have met with limited success, although infusion reactions are generally more common in the following settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With IV as compared to oral or intraperitoneal administration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After multiple cycles of certain agents (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Platinum drugs'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a prior infusion reaction to a drug of the same chemical class</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of multiple drug allergies, regardless of drug class</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF INFUSION REACTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">NCI classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most recent version of the <a href=\"https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm&amp;token=L1PKi7ksomh1JqUfTKWNe61gdDEj7/EN0gFsM2jnisnZ9aDYBZ/nKF0Y6hAnywy9MOvaze9hPSMvHYdMdeBk6asiYcR9Y9yHOUcUYVkBUtI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2835\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)</a> for grading adverse reactions during chemotherapy administration has a scale for grading the severity of infusion reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57843 \">table 1</a>) and separate grading scales for allergic reactions (which are appropriate for non-infusional medications) and anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91249\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91249 \">table 2</a>). </p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Allergists/immunologists</span> have a different approach to classifying infusion reactions, which divides them into reactions with features of mast cell or basophil activation (signifying potential progression to anaphylaxis) and those without such features (ie, SIRs). The severity of the reaction is considered separately. This approach is intended to identify patients at risk for anaphylaxis upon reexposure, regardless of the severity of the initial reaction.</p><p>Patients with even mild symptoms of mast <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/basophil</span> activation (eg, urticaria and dyspnea) must be treated with caution, because reexposure to the causative agent could result in a fulminant and severe anaphylaxis. One of the authors (MC) is aware of unpublished cases in which failure to recognize anaphylaxis and manage it appropriately led to fatalities upon reexposure to the causative drug, despite the premedications and reduced infusion rates that would have adequately managed most SIRs.</p><p>Thus, oncologists and other specialists working with chemotherapy drugs (eg, rheumatologists) should be familiar with the characteristics of anaphylactic reactions and manage these rare reactions differently from SIRs. We recommend that patients with even mild signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis not be reexposed to the causative agent until they have been evaluated by an allergy specialist with experience in drug allergy and desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In particular, these patients should NOT be considered candidates for additional premedication and an attempt at drug readministration using a slower rate of infusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis was traditionally defined as a constellation of symptoms and signs that arose from an IgE-mediated allergic reaction which resulted in explosive release of vasoactive mediators from mast cells and basophils throughout the body. However, the definition of anaphylaxis has been broadened in recent years to include any reaction that leads to widespread activation of mast cells and basophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Anaphylaxis is now diagnosed based upon clinical signs and symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This more inclusive definition emphasizes the common endpoint of mast <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/basophil</span> activation and the severity of the reactions that can result, and places less importance on the mechanism by which the cells are activated. In addition, clinicians should not equate anaphylaxis with anaphylactic shock, as the latter represents the severe end of a spectrum. The goal should be early recognition and appropriate management of anaphylaxis in its milder forms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All reactions with features of anaphylaxis should be considered potentially severe, because of the tendency of anaphylaxis to recur and worsen with reexposure. As an example, a patient who develops limited urticaria and mild wheezing after receiving a cytotoxic agent should be diagnosed with possible anaphylaxis and should not be considered a candidate for premedication and drug readministration at a slower rate of infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Instead, referral to an allergist and use of a desensitization protocol should be pursued. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Agents associated with anaphylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>In this topic review, as mentioned previously, anaphylaxis will be referred to as such, and all other infusion reactions will be grouped under the term standard infusion reactions (SIRs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cytotoxic agents implicated in anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis has been best established with the platinum drugs and the taxanes. Anaphylaxis to other cytotoxic agents is rare, although the possibility of anaphylaxis exists with any medication. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Platinum drugs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Taxanes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation of anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence that a reaction was anaphylaxis can be obtained from blood tests collected at the time of the reaction and from skin testing, a technique employed by allergy specialists to identify drugs which are capable of causing mast cell activation, especially through IgE-mediated immune mechanisms. These two diagnostic tools are discussed in this section.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum tests that support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis &mdash; Mast cells and basophils contain various chemical mediators that are transiently released into the circulation during anaphylaxis. Some of these are unique to these cell types and, if elevated, can help confirm that the reaction was anaphylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The laboratory test that is most useful in this setting is a serum total tryptase level. Tryptase levels usually peak within three hours of the onset of symptoms, so blood should be drawn one to three hours after the reaction occurs. Blood drawn &le; 30 minutes from the onset of symptoms may be falsely negative. Blood can be collected in a standard red top tube and serum should be frozen (at zero degrees Celsius) if it cannot be assayed promptly. Tryptase in frozen serum is stable for up to one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The upper limit of normal for serum total tryptase is approximately 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> depending on the assay system. Elevations in anaphylaxis can range from marginally elevated to greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Any elevation in serum tryptase is consistent with anaphylaxis, although a normal tryptase level does not exclude anaphylaxis because tryptase elevations are not seen in all anaphylactic reactions or may have resolved before the blood was collected. The interpretation of tryptase levels in anaphylaxis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a patient's reaction was suggestive of anaphylaxis but tryptase levels were not elevated, skin testing may still be informative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing to evaluate anaphylaxis &mdash; Skin testing is a technique used by allergy specialists to determine if a drug is capable of activating mast cells in the skin and therefore potentially able to cause anaphylaxis if administered systemically. The utility of skin testing is best established in the evaluation of reactions to the platinum drugs and may be useful in some patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> reactions (although this is not routine practice). (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18018679\" class=\"local\">'Drug versus vehicle'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF PREMEDICATION TO PREVENT INFUSION REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premedication can help prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce the severity of infusion reactions, particularly SIRs. In contrast, anaphylaxis is generally not prevented by premedication, although the severity of the reaction may be reduced in some cases.</p><p>Pharmacologic prophylaxis with antihistamines, glucocorticoids, or both is recommended for certain drugs that have a high incidence of infusion reactions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabazitaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabazitaxel</a>). However, these regimens have been derived empirically rather than established through randomized trials. Furthermore, they are not completely protective, even for SIRs. Therefore, even with premedication, patients must be monitored closely during and immediately after all chemotherapy infusions. Specific prophylactic regimens that are recommended for individual drugs are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT AND RECHALLENGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should be prepared for an infusion reaction to occur during each drug administration, and standing orders should be in place to allow immediate intervention if symptoms occur, without waiting for the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Medical equipment and supplies needed for resuscitation (pharmacologic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, antihistamines, intravenous fluids, and aerosolized bronchodilators as well as oxygen, tracheostomy equipment, and a defibrillator) should be readily available in any area where chemotherapy is administered.</p><p>Treatment of an infusion reaction and possible rechallenge depends upon the type and severity or the reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of mild to moderate SIRs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild to moderate SIRs (ie, National Cancer Institute [NCI] grades 1 and 2 and infusion reactions that do not involve symptoms of anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57843 \">table 1</a>)) are the most commonly encountered reactions. These can usually be managed with temporary interruption of the infusion and symptom management. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of reactions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Rechallenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After all symptoms have resolved, rechallenge with a reduced infusion rate and additional premedication is usually successful.</p><p>For patients who have recurrent SIRs despite premedication, desensitization protocols have allowed for continued use of the drug in some cases. Referral to an allergy specialist with experience in drug desensitization is an option for such patients, as a wider range of desensitization techniques can be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of anaphylaxis and severe SIRs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactions with <strong>any</strong> features of anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91249\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91249 \">table 2</a>) or severe SIRs (NCI grade 3 or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57843 \">table 1</a>)) require discontinuation of the drug infusion and immediate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and antihistamines.</p><p>Prompt recognition and treatment are critical in anaphylaxis. In series of fatal anaphylaxis from all causes, death typically ensues within 30 minutes from exposure to the trigger. Detailed guidelines for the management of anaphylaxis are available from the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, which are summarized in a rapid overview table for adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 4</a>) and children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

This is particularly true if the SIR included any symptoms suggestive of an allergic reaction, such as urticaria or angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In most cases, the mechanism of severe SIRs is not known, and so it is difficult to predict the best technique for preventing recurrence. If a patient is felt to be a candidate for continuation of therapy because there is potential clinical benefit of further treatment and no other reasonable alternatives exist, then we suggest desensitization, as this technique offers the most graduated and controlled manner of administration. At the author's institution (MC), these reactions are managed in the same manner as anaphylaxis, with uniformly good outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Management after anaphylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Management after anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rechallenge should not be attempted for suspected anaphylaxis. The platinum drugs, which are strongly associated with IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions, cause recurrent reactions upon rechallenge in approximately 50 percent of cases. Instead, we suggest referral to an allergy specialist with experience in drug desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With rare exception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], oncologists lack the expertise to evaluate and manage these patients by themselves.</p><p>Mast cells and basophils, the cells involved in anaphylaxis, can be temporarily hyporesponsive immediately after a reaction and may be unable to be activated further. This phenomenon has probably contributed to the confusion that currently exists in the medical literature about the safety of rechallenge following severe infusion reactions. However, this phenomenon is unpredictable, and the patient is at high risk for a recurrence of anaphylaxis as soon as the cells have recovered their sensitivity, a process which takes days to weeks. Therefore, we DO NOT recommend that patients be rechallenged after a reaction with symptoms of anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing (using the <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> and intradermal methods) with most chemotherapy agents is of limited value because the positive and negative predictive values are not known. An important exception to this is skin testing with the platinum drugs, which is useful in the evaluation of infusion reactions with features of allergic reactions. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Platinum drugs'</a> below.) One single report of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> skin testing was able to identify a highly reactive patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the utility of skin testing for taxane hypersensitivity should still be considered investigational.</p><p>Skin testing with other chemotherapy drugs is also considered investigational. Many chemotherapy agents can cause irritation and necrosis upon extravasation, and these should not be used for skin testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67517 \">table 6</a>). However, if investigational skin testing with other agents is undertaken and a positive result is obtained, then desensitization should be performed before readministration of the agent if there is no equivalent substitute therapy.</p><p>When indicated, skin testing is generally performed by <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology</span> specialists, with specific training in the technique, proper interpretation of results, and management of the rare allergic reactions that occur in response to the testing itself. A few oncology centers perform this testing and have acquired some experience with testing for specific drugs, although this is not a widespread practice.</p><p>Allergists perform <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> tests first, followed by intradermal tests if the <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> tests are negative. This is done because prick-puncture testing is less likely to induce a systemic allergic reaction in highly sensitive patients and also less likely to produce false positive, irritant responses. If prick-puncture testing is negative, then intradermal testing is performed. Appropriate positive (eg, histamine) and negative (saline or diluent for the therapeutic agent) must always be included.</p><p>In patients who have experienced a significant infusion reaction or anaphylaxis, skin testing is usually deferred for two to four weeks, since false negative results are possible during this period due to hyporeactivity of cutaneous mast cells. However, testing may be performed sooner if necessary, since positive tests are still meaningful. The technique of skin testing is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization involves readministration of the implicated drug in a highly controlled manner using a series of sequential steps in which the dose is gradually increased. Desensitization is indicated for infusion reactions that have features of anaphylaxis. The technique can also be applied to severe SIRs that recur despite slower rates of infusion and premedications. Important points regarding this technique include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization is absolutely contraindicated in patients with a history of chemotherapy-induced blistering or exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Reexposure in this setting can induce a fatal recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-side-effects-of-conventional-chemotherapy-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous side effects of conventional chemotherapy agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization is not effective in preventing the recurrence of other idiosyncratic immunologic reactions such as serum sickness, hemolytic anemia, or drug fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization should only be carried out under close medical supervision by experienced individuals who are comfortable with emergency management of anaphylaxis. In our view, all desensitization protocols should be performed by allergists, although as noted above, there are rare institutions at which experienced oncologists handle desensitization protocols by themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Drug desensitization protocols are based upon stepwise administration of increasing doses of medication, such that exposure begins at very low doses, increases gradually, and is uninterrupted. The protocols presented herein have been performed successfully in published reports, although modifications may be needed in individual cases, and experience with the technique is invaluable. Symptoms during the desensitization procedure are usually mild and occur most often during the final step [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Clinicians should avoid altering successful protocols to render them faster or significantly change the time interval between doses. Faster protocols may be acceptable for some types of infusion reactions, but are less likely to be successful in patients with IgE-mediated anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therefore, the authors suggest not using abbreviated protocols to desensitize to agents (such as the platinum drugs) in which an IgE-mediated mechanism has been implicated in infusion reactions. </p><p>Desensitization induces a state of temporary tolerance to a drug that is dependent on continuous exposure. The state of tolerance is lost once the drug is cleared. Therefore, <strong>patients must be counseled that they remain allergic to the drug and must be desensitized for each subsequent administration</strong>.</p><p>At some institutions, initial desensitizations are carried out in the medical intensive care unit. If the procedure is well tolerated, subsequent desensitizations can be performed on standard hospital floors or in hospital-associated infusion units with one-on-one nursing, using established policies and procedures, and after appropriate training of the nursing staff on desensitization procedures. Alternatively, the supervising allergist may stratify candidate patients for desensitization by risk. Patients without cardiac complications and with mild initial reactions can be desensitized in outpatient facilities for their first desensitization, under the supervision of the allergist and with one-to-one nursing care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">AGENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ANAPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The platinum drugs and the taxanes are the chemotherapeutic agents that most commonly cause anaphylaxis. However, any drug can cause anaphylaxis in a susceptible individual, and reactions with features of anaphylaxis have been reported with asparaginase, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ixabepilone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ixabepilone</a>.

The overall incidence ranges from 10 to 27 percent and typically occurs after the patient has completed an initial course of treatment, experienced a disease recurrence, and resumed therapy with the same platinum agent, or following at least six to seven cycles of continuous treatment.</p><p>Routine premedication is not typically administered with any of the platinum agents in the absence of an infusion reaction. However, for patients who will be retreated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> for recurrent ovarian cancer, a reasonable approach is to try to <span class=\"nowrap\">prevent/delay</span> the development of infusion reactions through the use of premedication and a graduated infusion rate, as previously described.</p><p>In patients who have had an infusion reaction (of any severity), skin testing reliably predicts the majority of anaphylactic reactions to platinum-type drugs, and patients who have a positive skin test should <strong>not</strong> be rechallenged without use of a desensitization protocol. Where local expertise is available, we suggest skin testing in patients who experience a reaction suggestive of anaphylaxis. If skin testing is negative and the initial infusion reaction was mild, the patient can be retreated with the platinum drug using a graded challenge.</p><p>For patients with positive skin testing after an infusion reaction to a platinum drug, we suggest desensitization. Desensitization should be repeated each time the patient needs the drug in the future. A patient who is sensitive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> may tolerate the other agent without the need for desensitization. If evaluation by an allergy specialist is not possible, and there is no reasonable alternative drug, then patients with infusion reactions that have any features of anaphylaxis (regardless of severity), patients with severe (ie, grade 3 or worse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57843 \">table 1</a>)) SIRs, and patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">mild/moderate</span> SIRs that recurred despite premedication and slower rate should be assumed to be at risk for anaphylaxis and only receive subsequent doses of the platinum drug in question using a formal desensitization protocol.</p><p>Most infusion reactions with the platinum drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>) are classic type I IgE-mediated allergic reactions, characterized by pruritus, urticaria, bronchospasm, facial swelling, and hypotension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 3</a>).

Referral to a drug allergy expert for skin testing and possible drug provocation testing is advised for patients treated with concurrent oxaliplatin and leucovorin if the results would alter the treatment plan. This might be the case if continuation of oxaliplatin with a different chemotherapy partner such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> would be considered if leucovorin was deemed responsible for the infusion reaction, or if a second-line chemotherapy regimen is being considered that also contains leucovorin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> plus leucovorin and short term infusional FU, FOLFIRI).

This study also emphasized the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to determine if patients have undergone silent inactivation (see below). </p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegaspargase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegaspargase</a> is the least immunogenic of the available formulations, infusion reactions still occur in 10 to 25 percent of patients, even with glucocorticoid prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/135,155-158\" class=\"abstract_t\">135,155-158</a>]. When they occur, reactions are typically of lesser severity than seen with the nonpegylated E. coli and Erwinia-derived products. Because of this property of pegaspargase, and because of its long half-life so that it can be given in a more convenient schedule (eg, every other week instead of three times per week), most treatment protocols now use pegaspargase in newly diagnosed patients rather than reserving it for patients who develop an infusion reaction to nonpegylated asparaginase. Other factors influencing this decision are availability and cost; L-asparaginase is no longer available in the United States, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erwinia-asparaginase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Erwinia asparaginase</a> is more costly than other forms of asparaginase [152].</p><p>In addition to these factors, the likelihood of asparaginase eliciting an immune response in patients may be influenced by other factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The concomitant administration of glucocorticoids is associated with reduced signs of clinical hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/143,159\" class=\"abstract_t\">143,159</a>].

Certain drugs, most commonly the platinum agents and taxanes, are associated with anaphylaxis, a type of reaction that arises from sudden and widespread activation of mast cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basophils. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>Infusion reactions range in severity from mild pruritus and flushing to life-threatening hypotension and bronchospasm. Most reactions are mild and occur during or within one hour of drug administration. Infusion reactions may occur after the first or any subsequent course of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) system of classifying infusion reactions is based upon severity. However, allergists have a different approach, which emphasizes the differentiation of anaphylaxis from all other types of infusion reactions (ie, SIRs). Although there is some overlap with symptoms of SIR, characteristic symptoms of anaphylaxis include urticaria, wheezing, hypotension, and gastrointestinal symptoms, but not fever. The distinction between anaphylaxis and other reactions is emphasized because anaphylaxis is likely to recur despite premedication and can typically become more severe upon reexposure, regardless of the severity of the initial symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Classification of infusion reactions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premedication can help prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce the severity of infusion reactions, although it is less effective in preventing anaphylaxis. Specific premedication regimens for individual agents are addressed in the individual sections above. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Use of premedication to prevent infusion reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>Even in patients who receive premedication, clinicians must be prepared for an infusion reaction to occur during each drug administration. Standing orders should be in place to allow immediate intervention without waiting for the clinician to arrive. Medical equipment and supplies needed for resuscitation (including pharmacologic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, antihistamines, and aerosolized bronchodilators as well as oxygen, tracheostomy equipment, and a defibrillator) should be readily available in any area where chemotherapy is administered. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Principles of treatment and rechallenge'</a> above.)</p><p>The role of skin testing to screen patients before they develop an infusion reaction remains uncertain, and most institutions do not routinely perform skin tests to predict the likelihood of a reaction to any agent. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Rechallenge'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate management is tailored to the clinical situation. The following represent general guidelines for management of a patient who is suspected of having an infusion reaction to a chemotherapeutic agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild to moderate SIRs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the reaction is limited to mild or moderate symptoms of SIR (grades 1 or 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57843 \">table 1</a>)), without features suggestive of anaphylaxis, drug infusion should be temporarily stopped and assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, and mentation accomplished rapidly. IV administration of 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> may provide symptomatic relief. Once symptoms have resolved, resumption of the drug infusion at a slowed rate may permit treatment continuation with close monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe SIR or anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe SIRs (grades 3 or 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57843 \">table 1</a>)) or reactions with any features of anaphylaxis (eg, generalized urticaria, wheezing, hypotension, and angioedema) require prompt recognition and treatment. In fatal anaphylaxis, death typically ensues within 30 minutes from exposure to the trigger. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of anaphylaxis and severe SIRs'</a> above.)</p><p>Initial management of anaphylaxis is summarized in a rapid overview table for adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 4</a>) and children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 5</a>), and includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately discontinue drug infusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the patient in the supine position with legs elevated (if tolerated)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess airway, breathing, circulation, and adequacy of mentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call for help (summon a resuscitation team in the hospital setting, call 911 or an equivalent service in the community setting)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> into the anterolateral thigh (0.3 to 0.5 mg aqueous epinephrine, 1:1000 dilution)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish IV access with two 14 to 16 gauge catheters</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer both an H1- (eg, 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>) and an H2- (eg, 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a>) antihistamine IV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic administration of a glucocorticoid (eg, 125 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> IV) may not help acutely, although it may prevent a prolonged or recurrent reaction.</p><p/><p>Rapid recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis is covered in more detail elsewhere.

The decision to attempt retreatment depends upon the drug, the severity of the reaction, the cancer being treated and the intent of treatment (ie, potentially curative or palliative), and whether there are reasonable treatment alternatives. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Principles of treatment and rechallenge'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the reaction was mild or moderate (NCI grades 1 or 2) <strong>and lacking</strong> signs or symptoms to suggest anaphylaxis, rechallenge is often possible with premedication (glucocorticoids, antihistamines) and a slower rate of infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For severe SIRs (NCI grade 3 or higher) and any reactions with symptoms of anaphylaxis, retreatment should not be attempted. Instead, we suggest referral to an allergy or oncology center with experience in drug desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/33,184\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,184</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing is helpful in the evaluation of severe SIRs to platinum drugs. Preliminary evidence suggests that it may also be helpful in patients with SIRs to taxanes that have features of anaphylaxis, although it cannot yet be considered a routine component of the evaluation of taxane reactions. If skin testing is positive, then the patient should not be rechallenged. If there is no equivalent substitute drug, then such patients should be given that medication only through desensitization in the future. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Overview of skin testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Overview of desensitization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77\"><span class=\"h2\">Desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization protocols have been developed at centers with expertise in drug allergy, and they have been most successfully applied to taxanes and platinum drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/33,189\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,189</a>]. However, experience with desensitization is not widespread, and the success of these protocols in other settings has not been reported. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Platinum drugs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Taxanes'</a> above.)</p><p>Desensitization should only be carried out under close medical supervision by experienced individuals who are prepared to deal with emergency management of anaphylaxis. Most, if not all desensitization protocols are performed by allergists. Desensitization must be repeated each time the patient requires the drug in the future.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Markman M, Kennedy A, Webster K, et al.
