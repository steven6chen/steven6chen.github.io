Lactic acidosis is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in hospitalized patients. Although the acidosis is usually associated with an elevated anion gap, moderately increased lactate levels can be observed with a normal anion gap (especially if hypoalbuminemia exists and the anion gap is not appropriately corrected). When lactic acidosis exists as an isolated acid-base disturbance, the arterial pH is reduced. However, other coexisting disorders can raise the pH into the normal range or even generate an elevated pH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis#H1759298509\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment of the serum anion gap'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lactic acidosis occurs when lactic acid production exceeds lactic acid clearance. The increase in lactate production is usually caused by impaired tissue oxygenation, either from decreased oxygen delivery or a defect in mitochondrial oxygen utilization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathophysiology and causes of lactic acidosis will be reviewed here. The possible role of bicarbonate therapy in such patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicarbonate-therapy-in-lactic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review of the biochemistry of lactate generation and metabolism is important in understanding the pathogenesis of lactic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Both overproduction and reduced metabolism of lactate appear to be operative in most patients.</p><p>Cellular lactate generation is influenced by the &quot;redox state&quot; of the cell. The redox state in the cellular cytoplasm is reflected by the ratio of oxidized and reduced nicotine adenine dinucleotide (ie, NAD<sup>+</sup> [oxidized form] and NADH [reduced form]).</p><p>NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH are involved in many cellular redox reactions, serving, respectively, as an electron acceptor or an electron donor. One of these cellular redox reactions is the equilibrium between pyruvic acid and lactic acid, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91092\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91092 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, the ratio of pyruvate and lactate is influenced by the ratio of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH, such that a reduced redox state (ie, low NAD<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/NADH</span> ratio) is associated with a shift in the ratio from pyruvate to lactate. Many of the factors that reduce the cytoplasmic redox state also accelerate pyruvate generation and simultaneously impair mitochondrial oxidation. These factors combine to increase pyruvate and lactate generation and simultaneously impair mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and oxidation (see <a href=\"#H254567\" class=\"local\">'Mitochondrial dysfunction'</a> below). Inadequate oxygen delivery or utilization and rapid oxidation of certain substrates such as ethanol will have these effects.</p><p>Lactate dehydrogenase is stereospecific for the production of the L-isomer of lactate (L-lactate), and, in humans, L-lactate is the dominant isomer that is synthesized and utilized. Although D-lactate is a minor component of mammalian metabolism, it can be a major metabolic product of some bacteria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=d-lactic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;D-lactic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Normal individuals produce 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> of lactic acid per day. Most is derived from glucose metabolism via the glycolytic pathway, although deamination of alanine also generates lactate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Balance is maintained by the utilization of an equal amount of lactic acid.</p><p>Lactic acid is primarily oxidized to carbon dioxide and water (70 to 80 percent) and used to generate glucose (15 to 20 percent). A small amount of lactate is also converted to alanine. Utilization of lactic acid primarily occurs in the liver, but the kidneys, heart, and other tissues also participate. A large amount of lactic acid is generated from glucose by nonhepatic tissues and from glycogen by muscle. The delivery of this lactic acid to the liver, where it is converted back to glucose, is named the Cori, or lactic acid, cycle.</p><p>When lactic acid accumulates in body fluids and its concentration increases, the hydrogen ions are almost completely buffered by extracellular bicarbonate. When lactate is utilized, whether by oxidation to carbon dioxide and water or by conversion to glucose or alanine, a hydrogen ion is also consumed, and a bicarbonate molecule is generated. Thus, in a patient who has accumulated lactic acid, utilization of the lactate will restore the bicarbonate concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92137198\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of lactate accumulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess lactate can accumulate as a result of increased production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diminished utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In general, three mechanisms can cause lactate accumulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78983 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased pyruvate production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced entry of pyruvate into mitochondria, where it would be oxidized to either carbon dioxide and water or converted to glucose precursors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shift of the cellular cytoplasmic redox state such that NADH accumulates and NAD<sup>+</sup> falls. This drives the <span class=\"nowrap\">pyruvate/lactate</span> ratio toward lactate.</p><p/><p>The contribution of lactate overproduction to the development of metabolic acidosis seems clear in certain disorders. As an example, plasma lactate levels may transiently increase to 15 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> after a grand mal seizure or with maximal exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and the blood pH can fall as low as 6.8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, the rate of lactate utilization in such patients can also increase rapidly, reaching rates as high as 320 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a result, blood pH and plasma bicarbonate levels rapidly return to normal after the seizure or exercise has ceased.</p><p>A marked increase in lactate production, in part due to catecholamine stimulation of glycolysis, also plays an important role in the lactic acidosis associated with shock, especially septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Similarly, the use of high-dose inhaled beta-agonists may contribute to the development of lactic acidosis in patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>However, the very high potential metabolic capacity for lactate utilization that is apparent in patients with grand mal seizures suggests that there must also be a component of decreased lactate utilization in disorders such as shock in which lactic acidosis occurs despite more modest lactate overproduction.</p><p>The importance of impaired lactate metabolism is illustrated by the observation that, when lactic acid is infused into normal animals at rates similar to the rate of overproduction that occurs in shock, hepatic utilization of lactate increases, and there is only a minimal fall in arterial pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In shock, reduced hepatic perfusion and an associated intracellular acidosis probably combine to substantially diminish hepatic lactate metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/4,5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,12</a>]. The role of diminished lactate metabolism in sepsis is supported by the decrease in lactate levels that occurs when dichloroacetate, a stimulator of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of lactic acidosis can generally be divided into those associated with obviously impaired tissue oxygenation (type A) and those in which systemic impairment in oxygenation does not exist or is not readily apparent (type B) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78983 \">table 1</a>). However, there is frequently overlap between type A and type B lactic acidosis. In sepsis, for example, there is both an increase in lactate production resulting from microcirculatory failure and also a decrease in lactate clearance that is not solely due to diminished oxygen delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Type A lactic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of lactic acidosis are due to marked tissue hypoperfusion resulting from hypovolemia, cardiac failure, sepsis, or cardiopulmonary arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/2,3,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,14,15</a>]. In some of these patients, concurrent respiratory acidosis contributes to the acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

It is likely that hypovolemia plays an important role. In addition, hyperlactatemia has been reported in patients with diabetes independent of ketoacidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], possibly due to decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D-lactic acid may accumulate and contribute to the anion gap acidosis of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Lactate production is usually normal, but lactate utilization may fall as a result of hepatic dysfunction. The oxidation of ethanol generates reduced nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and can thereby reduce the oxidized nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">)/NADH</span> ratio. This ratio change shifts pyruvate toward lactate (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above). Although the plasma lactate concentration seldom exceeds 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> in intoxicated patients, alcohol ingestion can also increase the severity of other disorders that cause overproduction of lactate.

Although the mechanism is not proven, the lactic acidosis in such patients may be due to adrenergic-induced glycolysis and lipolysis, which increase pyruvate and free fatty acid concentrations, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Free fatty acids can inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase and thereby slow the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A. Cytoplasmic pyruvate accumulates and is converted to lactate. Because the reported cases of lactic acidosis in asthma have usually occurred in the presence of severe asthma, increased lactate production by respiratory muscles may be another contributing mechanism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254567\"><span class=\"h3\">Mitochondrial dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pyruvate metabolism requires its entry into the mitochondria.

Lactic acidosis is generally defined as a plasma lactate concentration greater than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> even in the absence of overt acidemia.</p><p>The recognition of lactic acidosis has increased dramatically over the past several years as a result of the wide acceptance of early goal-directed therapy of sepsis and septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-lactic-acidosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The screening and triage processes for patients with suspected sepsis include a blood lactate level. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults#H2170293153\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Monitor response'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16062069\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactic acidosis is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in hospitalized patients. Impaired tissue oxygenation, leading to increased anaerobic metabolism, is usually responsible for the rise in lactate production. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A plasma lactate concentration that exceeds 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> generally defines lactic acidosis, even among patients without a systemic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accumulation of lactate is usually due to enhanced pyruvate production; reduced pyruvate conversion to carbon dioxide and water or to glucose; and an altered redox state within the cell, which shifts the <span class=\"nowrap\">pyruvate/lactate</span> ratio toward lactate. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A lactic acidosis is associated with impaired tissue oxygenation due to tissue hypoperfusion in shock (caused by hypovolemia, cardiac failure, or sepsis) or as a result of a cardiopulmonary arrest. Accelerated generation of pyruvate from glucose may also play an important role in some forms of type A lactic acidosis, especially in septic shock. In some patients, concurrent respiratory acidosis contributes to the acidemia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Type A lactic acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B lactic acidosis occurs in patients without overt systemic hypoperfusion. Causes of type B lactic acidosis include toxin-induced impairment of cellular metabolism, regional areas of tissue ischemia, high levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, malignancy-associated lactic acidosis, alcoholism, and drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-infected patients. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Type B lactic acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D-lactic acidosis is an unusual form of metabolic acidosis that occurs in patients with short bowel syndrome or other forms of malabsorption. It may also develop in patients receiving rapid and high-dose infusions of propylene glycol (a solvent for some intravenous [IV] medications) or in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.
