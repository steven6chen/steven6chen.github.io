GTN comprises specific histologic entities, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive mole</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choriocarcinoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT)</p><p/><p>GTN is a rare disease that ideally should be managed at trophoblastic disease centers where concentration of cases provides clinicians with ample experience, opportunities for research, and improved outcomes. Since most patients are managed locally, however, it is important for clinicians who encounter these patients to familiarize themselves with the latest advances in the field in order to optimize their patient's outcome.</p><p>Prior to the development of effective chemotherapy for GTN, the majority of patients with disease localized to the uterus were cured with hysterectomy, whereas metastatic disease was almost uniformly fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With the utilization of sensitive quantitative assays for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and highly effective chemotherapy, most women with GTN can be cured and their reproductive function preserved, providing they are managed according to well-established guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, women are at risk for both resistant and recurrent GTN, which will require further therapy. Even then, women who experience a recurrence stand a good chance of achieving remission.</p><p>Patients whose hCG level re-elevates after becoming undetectable are considered to have recurrent disease. In contrast, patients whose hCG level remains elevated despite treatment are considered to have resistant disease. </p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to and treatment of resistant or recurrent GTN.

In one study, the reported recurrence rates according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98185 \">table 1</a>) were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I (non-metastatic) &ndash; 2 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stages II and III; low-risk GTN &ndash; 4 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II to IV; high-risk &ndash; 13 percent </p><p/><p>At the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center (NETDC), the reported recurrence rates were 2.9 percent in patients with non-metastatic disease, 8.3 percent in stage II patients, 4.2 percent in stage III patients, and 9.1 percent in patients with FIGO stage IV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Risk factors for recurrence in most studies appear to be related to a large initial tumor burden, inadequate primary therapy, and in patients who defaulted on potential treatments or non-compliant follow-up. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19650240\"><span class=\"h1\">PRE-TREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients who develop chemoresistant or recurrent disease require re-staging. In addition, this evaluation should be repeated each time a new course of treatment is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-risk-stratification#H14900645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia: Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'Staging and risk assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who recur or develop resistance often have multi-organ involvement, particularly if they were previously treated for high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Therefore, re-imaging with chest, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed to help guide treatment options. For patients in whom the diagnosis is questionable, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may aid in the differential characterization of active disease (which should be PET-positive) from fibrotic tumor nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19650246\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW-RISK GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC NEOPLASIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, primary resistance after single-agent chemotherapy occurs in 10 to 30 percent of patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). However, this figure rises to between 30 and 50 percent of patients with low-risk GTN in the presence of metastases. Patients who develop resistance to the initial single agent usually will respond to an alternative single agent, and only about 15 percent will require multi-agent therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>There have been no randomized trials comparing single-agent to multi-agent chemotherapy for patients with low-risk GTN who experience primary resistance to single-agent chemotherapy. However, our clinical experience indicates that a second-line single-agent therapy is effective and induces remission in the vast majority of patients. As such, this is our preferred approach. Other institutions, however, use human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level at the time of introduction of second-line treatment to determine whether single- or multiagent chemotherapy should be initiated. For patients with an hCG level under 300 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L,</span> single-agent actinomycin D (ActD) is their standard choice, while for women with an hCG &gt;300 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> at the time of treatment, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), ActD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> (EMA-CO) is chosen. Using this cutoff, approximately 95 percent of patients treated with single-agent ActD successfully completed treatment without requiring additional therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of note, some data suggest that patients with higher risk scores (ie, 5 to 6) are at a greater risk of resistant disease compared with those with lower prognostic scores. This was shown in one single-institution study in which only 30 percent of these patients went into a sustained remission with second-line monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These patients characteristically present with a pretreatment hCG level &gt;100,000 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> and Doppler ultrasound evidence of a large tumor burden in their uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For such patients, multi-agent chemotherapy is a reasonable option. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19650253\"><span class=\"h2\">Second-line single-agent chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients treated with MTX, with or without folinic acid (FA), who develop resistant or recurrent disease, we then administer biweekly bolus ActD. If the initial treatment was ActD, we proceed with treatment using MTX-FA. These and other single-agent options are discussed separately.

Therefore, growth factor support (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=filgrastim-including-biosimilars-of-filgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">filgrastim</a>) is usually required. In addition to chemotherapy, these patients may benefit from surgical excision of localized, persistent tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-resistant-or-recurrent-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].<sup> </sup>Further discussion of the role of surgery is covered below.

With the utilization of sensitive quantitative assays for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and highly effective chemotherapy, women with resistant disease and those who experience a recurrence stand a good chance of achieving remission. (See <a href=\"#H19650228\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women treated for GTN are at varying risks of developing either resistant or recurrent disease. In one study, the reported recurrence rates were 2, 4, and 13 percent for stage I (non-metastatic), stage II to III (low-risk), and stage III to IV (high-risk) disease. (See <a href=\"#H19650234\" class=\"local\">'Estimating the risk of resistant or recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who recur or develop resistance often have multi-organ involvement, particularly if they were previously treated for high-risk GTN. Therefore, re-imaging with chest, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H19650240\" class=\"local\">'Pre-treatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with low-risk GTN who are resistant to or recur after prior single-agent treatment, we recommend an alternative single agent rather than multi-agent chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For example, patients who are resistant to or recur after prior treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) with or without folinic acid (FA) should receive biweekly bolus actinomycin D (ActD).
