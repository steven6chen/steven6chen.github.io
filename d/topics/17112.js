These characteristics include obesity, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar levels, and high triglycerides (fat-like substances in the blood). Having a combination of these characteristics increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Keeping your weight, blood sugar, and cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control can help you to live longer and decrease your risk of heart attack and stroke.</p><p>There is controversy as to whether metabolic syndrome is really a &quot;syndrome.&quot;</p><p>More detailed information about metabolic information is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS METABOLIC SYNDROME?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolic syndrome is a group of characteristics. You do not need to have all of the characteristics to have it. However, a person with one characteristic is more likely to have others. Most expert groups define metabolic syndrome as the presence of three or more of the following characteristics in a person:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity, especially in the abdominal area (defined by some groups as a waist size greater than 94 to 102 cm [38 to 41 in] in men or greater than 80 cm [32 in] in women)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired glycemia&nbsp;(fasting blood sugar of 100 to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> or glycated hemoglobin [A1C] 5.7 to 6.4 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">(130/85</span> mmHg or higher) or if you take medicine for high blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased fasting levels of triglycerides (greater than 150 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or decreased fasting high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> for men or 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> for women) or if you take medicine for high triglycerides or low HDL cholesterol</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW COMMON IS METABOLIC SYNDROME?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic syndrome is becoming increasingly common. In one study performed between 1999 and 2002, more than 34 percent of participants were classified as having metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This number is significantly increased from a similar study performed between 1988 and 1994, when 22 percent of people had metabolic syndrome.</p><p>The following factors are thought to increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being overweight (body mass index of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or more) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-adults-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-adults-metric-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menopause (in women)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating a high-carbohydrate diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of physical activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of diabetes or metabolic syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Health risks associated with metabolic syndrome</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 2 diabetes is much more likely to develop among people with the metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Healthy lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise, can help to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Cardiovascular disease includes coronary artery disease (collections of fatty plaques inside the heart's blood vessels), cerebrovascular disease (collections of fatty plaques inside the blood vessels leading to the brain), and high blood pressure. Cardiovascular disease can lead to heart attack, stroke, or angina (chest pain).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">METABOLIC SYNDROME DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolic syndrome is diagnosed based upon a physical exam and a blood test of your blood sugar (either fasting [before breakfast] blood sugar or a test any time of A1C), cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. A description of how blood glucose and cholesterol levels are measured is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Overview (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">METABOLIC SYNDROME TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment for the metabolic syndrome are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce or eliminate underlying problems (eg, obesity, lack of activity) by losing weight and becoming more active</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure and cholesterol, if these problems persist despite losing weight and exercising</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of the metabolic syndrome usually includes losing weight and becoming more active. Your diet should be low in fat and cholesterol.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Mediterranean diet is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, and olive oil. This diet can help to lower weight, blood pressure, lipids, and improve insulin resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet can reduce blood pressure, weight, lipids, and fasting blood glucose levels. The DASH diet requires you to eat no more than 2400 mg of sodium per day, four to five servings of fruit, four to five servings of vegetables, and two to three servings of low-fat dairy products; all foods must contain less than 25 percent total fat per serving.
