More detailed discussions for specific primary tumor site are presented in the relevant site-specific topics. A general overview of treatment is also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256481084\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are large geographic differences in the incidence and primary site of head and neck cancers. These likely reflect the prevalence of risk factors, such as tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as ethnic and genetic differences among populations.</p><p>Although the highest rates of head and neck cancer are in older males, the incidence has been increasing in females as more women use tobacco, and in young non-smokers as human papillomavirus (HPV) plays an increasingly prominent role as an etiologic factor in the development of oropharyngeal head and neck cancer. </p><p>Tobacco (smoked and smokeless) is the most important known risk factor for the development of head and neck cancer. There is some evidence for a genetic predisposition to the carcinogenic effects of tobacco. In addition, tobacco and alcohol consumption appear to have a synergistic effect. The repeated exposure of the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract to the carcinogenic effects of tobacco, alcohol, or both appears to cause multiple primary and secondary tumors in this &quot;condemned mucosa,&quot; a phenomenon described as &quot;field cancerization.&quot; </p><p>HPV infection is a causative agent for head and neck cancer. HPV associated head and neck cancers occur primarily in the oropharynx (tonsils and base of tongue), account for the younger age of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and define a subset of patients with improved treatment outcome. The use of HPV status in clinical decision-making remains investigational at this time, although there are multiple active deintensification trials currently in progress. The goal of these trials is to decrease the short- and long-term toxicity of treatment. Nonetheless treatment outside of a clinical trial remains the same as for patients without an HPV associated tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other head and neck cancer risk factors include betel nut chewing, radiation exposure, vitamin deficiencies, periodontal disease, immunosuppression, and other environmental and occupational exposures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second primary malignancies in patients with head and neck cancers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC SUBSITES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head and neck cancer encompasses a variety of cancers, mostly squamous cell carcinoma, arising from a variety of sites. The head and neck region consists of several anatomic areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97306 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oral cavity includes the lips, buccal mucosa, anterior tongue, floor of the mouth, hard palate, and upper and lower gingiva. The anterior border of the oral cavity is defined by the vermillion of the lips. The posterior border is defined by the circumvallate papillae of the tongue, the anterior tonsillar pillars (palatoglossus muscles), and the posterior margin of the hard palate. The hard palate defines the superior boundary of the oral cavity. Inferiorly, the oral cavity is defined by the mylohyoid muscles. The lateral boundary of the oral cavity is defined by the buccomasseteric region (buccal mucosa of the cheeks) and the retromolar trigone (which is located behind the mandibular third molar).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pharynx is divided into the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The nasopharynx forms the continuation of the nasal cavity. The boundary between the nasal cavity and nasopharynx is defined by the posterior choanae of the nasal cavity. The nasopharynx is defined superiorly by the basisphenoid and basiocciput (clivus) and inferiorly by the hard and soft palate. The prevertebral muscle and anterior margin of the cervical spine at C1 and C2 levels form the posterior margin of the nasopharynx. The posterolateral boundary of the nasopharynx includes several important structures. The lateral wall of the nasopharynx is elevated by the torus tubarius, a cartilaginous structure that constitutes the opening of the Eustachian tube. The Eustachian tube allows communication between the middle ear and the nasopharynx through a defect (sinus of Morgagni) of the pharyngobasilar fascia, which lines the nasopharynx. The sinus of Morgagni may allow nasopharyngeal cancer to gain access into the skull base. The fossa of Rosenm&uuml;ller (lateral nasopharyngeal recess), a common site of nasopharyngeal cancer, is located posterior to the torus tubarius. The nasopharynx also includes the adenoids (nasopharyngeal tonsils), located in the midline roof of the nasopharynx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The soft palate defines the boundary between the nasopharynx and oropharynx. The oropharynx is separated anteriorly from the oral cavity by the circumvallate papillae and the anterior tonsillar pillars. The palatine tonsils, posterior tonsillar pillars, tongue base (posterior one-third of the tongue), valleculae, soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall are structures of the oropharynx. Inferiorly, the oropharynx is defined by the hyoid and the pharyngoepiglottic folds. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The hypopharynx includes the pyriform sinuses, the posterior surface of the larynx (postcricoid area), and the inferior, posterior, and lateral pharyngeal walls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The larynx, which is divided into three anatomic regions: the supraglottic region, the glottic larynx (true vocal cords and mucosa of the anterior and posterior commissures), and the subglottic larynx, which extends to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses (maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual) and minor salivary glands. Minor salivary glands are found within the submucosa throughout the oral cavity, palate, paranasal sinuses, pharynx, larynx, trachea and bronchi, but are most concentrated in the buccal, labial, palatal, and lingual regions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of head and neck cancer varies widely depending upon the primary site and exposure to various risk factors. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Otalgia</strong> &ndash; Otalgia as a presenting symptom is significant. Cranial nerves 5, 7, 9, and 10 contribute afferents to the external and middle ear. Referred otalgia is considered a &quot;red flag&quot; in the evaluation of a patient with a possible head and neck malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma</strong> &ndash; The most frequent presenting complaint is a neck mass due to regional lymph node metastasis, which occurs in nearly 90 percent of patients. Symptoms due to the primary tumor may include hearing loss (associated with serous otitis media), tinnitus, nasal obstruction and pain, and its associated growth into adjacent anatomical structures, which can lead to muscle involvement and impaired function of cranial nerves II to VI. Adults with a unilateral effusion should have an examination of the nasopharynx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral cavity tumors</strong> &ndash; Patients may present with mouth pain or nonhealing mouth ulcers, loosening of teeth, ill-fitting dentures, dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, bleeding, or referred otalgia. Up to 66 percent of patients with primary tongue lesions have cervical lymph node involvement, depending on T stage and depth of invasion, while the incidence is substantially lower in patients with hard palate cancers. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tongue cancer may grow as an infiltrative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exophytic lesion. The presenting symptom is often pain, with or without dysarthria. Dysarthria implies deep muscle invasion of advanced tumor stage. There may be a history of longstanding leukoplakia or erythroplakia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lip cancer usually presents as an exophytic or ulcerative lesion of the lower lip, occasionally associated with bleeding or pain. Some patients complain of numbness of the skin of the chin due to involvement of the mental nerve. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oropharyngeal tumors</strong> &ndash; Presenting complaints can include dysphagia, pain (odynophagia, otalgia), obstructive sleep apnea or snoring, bleeding, or a neck mass. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancers often present with neck masses. Many of these patients do not have other clinical complaints, including the classic symptoms of odynophagia and otalgia. Neck mass, which is often cystic, may be the only clinical complaint. These cystic neck masses are often mistaken for branchial cleft cyst carcinomas. In reality, branchial cleft cyst carcinoma is exceptionally rare and its diagnosis should be one of exclusion rather than presumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For adult patients presenting with cystic neck mass, metastatic cystic squamous cell carcinoma associated with HPV needs to be strongly considered and excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypopharyngeal tumors</strong> <em>&ndash; </em>Patients with these tumors often remain asymptomatic for a longer period and are therefore more likely to be seen in the later stages of the disease. Dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia, weight loss, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and neck mass are common presenting symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laryngeal cancer</strong> &ndash; The symptoms associated with cancer of the larynx depend upon location. Persistent hoarseness may be the initial complaint in glottic cancers; later symptoms may include dysphagia, referred otalgia, chronic cough, hemoptysis, and stridor. Supraglottic cancers are often discovered later and may present with airway obstruction or palpable metastatic lymph nodes. Primary subglottic tumors are rare. Affected patients typically present with stridor or complaints of dyspnea on exertion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sinus tumors</strong> &ndash; Common presenting symptoms of sinus tumors include epistaxis and unilateral nasal obstruction. Facial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> head pain may be seen in later stages, due to pressure or tumor infiltration into nerves or periosteum. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous cell carcinomas account for 90 to 95 percent of the lesions in the oral cavity and larynx. They can be categorized as well differentiated (greater than 75 percent keratinization), moderately differentiated (25 to 75 percent keratinization), and poorly differentiated (less than 25 percent keratinization) tumors. Less common histologies include verrucous carcinoma (a variant of squamous cell carcinoma), adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms#H84270723\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Squamous cell carcinoma'</a>.) </p><p>Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck often develops through a series of changes from premalignant entities due to carcinogen exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms#H84270693\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Squamous cell cancer precursors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical signs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leukoplakia is characterized by hyperparakeratosis and is usually associated with underlying epithelial hyperplasia. In the absence of underlying dysplastic changes, the probability of malignant change is less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Erythroplakia is characterized by red superficial patches adjacent to normal mucosa. It is commonly associated with epithelial dysplasia and is associated with carcinoma in situ or invasive tumor in up to 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histopathologic findings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysplasia is defined histopathologically by the presence of mitoses and prominent nucleoli. Involvement of the entire mucosal thickness is usually referred to as carcinoma in situ. Dysplasia is associated with progression to invasive cancer in 15 to 30 percent of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TNM STAGING SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tumor, node, metastases (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) is used to classify cancers of the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The T classifications indicate the extent of the primary tumor and are site specific; there is considerable overlap in the cervical N classifications. </p><p>TNM staging varies depending upon the primary tumor site:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110767\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110767 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-stage-i-and-ii-early-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of stage I and II (early) head and neck cancer: The oral cavity&quot;, section on 'Overview of approach to oral cavity cancers'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasopharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110658\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110658 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early and locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Pathology and staging'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oropharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110659%7EONC%2F110628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110659 graphicRef110628 \">table 3A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110640%7EONC%2F110641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110640 graphicRef110641 \">table 4A-B</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The oropharynx&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypopharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110661%7EONC%2F110631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110661 graphicRef110631 \">table 5A-B</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-hypopharynx#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The hypopharynx&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and staging'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110769\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110769 \">table 6</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The larynx&quot;, section on 'Staging and anatomy'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110768 \">table 7</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the nasal vestibule&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paranasal-sinus-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paranasal sinus cancer&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and staging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumors of the nasal cavity&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salivary glands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110657%7EONC%2F110617\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110657 graphicRef110617 \">table 8A-B</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salivary-gland-tumors-epidemiology-diagnosis-evaluation-and-staging#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salivary gland tumors: Epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and staging&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6093579\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial assessment of the primary tumor is based upon a thorough history and combination of inspection, palpation, indirect mirror examination, or direct flexible laryngoscopy. Physical examination should include careful assessment of the nasal cavity and oral cavity with visual examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palpation of mucous membranes, the floor of the mouth, the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, tonsillar fossae and tongue base (best seen on mirror examination or flexible laryngoscopy), palate, buccal and gingival mucosa, and posterior pharyngeal wall. </p><p>External auditory canal examination and anterior rhinoscopy should be undertaken.</p><p>For patients with non-laryngeal lesions but a strong alcohol or smoking history, flexible laryngoscopy is commonly undertaken to visualize potential other lesions and to document vocal cord mobility.</p><p>A metastatic work-up with appropriate imaging is recommended for all newly-diagnosed head and neck cancer patients, with particular attention to regional lymph node spread. For those with locoregionally advanced tumors, distant metastatic imaging, with attention to the lungs, is often performed. Patients with severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ who have a strong smoking, alcohol, or family history of cancer may also benefit from a more extensive work-up for metastases or a second primary including a screening chest computed tomography (CT). Use of clinical judgement is important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Visualization of lesions outside the mouth is best accomplished by mirror examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of a flexible fiberoptic endoscope with the goal of examining all of the mucosa in the nasopharynx oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Aside from mucosal irregularities, other abnormalities that should be specifically searched for are impairment of vocal cord mobility, pooling of secretions, anatomic asymmetries, and bleeding. The appropriate nodal drainage areas are examined by careful palpation of the neck. Examination of the neck for pathologic adenopathy or other masses is best done according to neck levels. The parotid glands are also palpated for abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>An examination under anesthesia often is performed to best characterize the extent of the tumor, to look for synchronous second primary tumors, and to take biopsies for a tissue diagnosis. This exam is particularly useful for patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal malignancies. Symptom-directed panendoscopy (laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy) reveals a 2.4 to 4.5 percent incidence of second primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract, but not of the lower airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Other authors have found that screening panendoscopy revealed second primary cancers only in patients with a current or past smoking history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There is evidence that positron emission tomography (PET) may complement or replace panendoscopy in detecting synchronous primary cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], although some studies have shown there is still a risk of false negatives (9 in 589 patients in one study). In general, patients with a history of heavy alcohol or tobacco use should undergo a work-up for second primary tumors with PET or panendoscopy as part of their operative staging for characterization of the primary tumor or to look for distant disease in early stage disease. Operative staging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> panendoscopy may find synchronous primaries that are too small to be identified with PET, while PET may identify lower aerodigestive tract tumors not seen with panendoscopy. Although the incidence of second or synchronous primary tumor is low, the impact on treatment for the individual patient is significant. Those with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive tumors without other known risk factors are not as likely to benefit from panendoscopy.</p><p>Imaging studies may augment the physical exam and evaluation of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, particularly for assessing the degree of local invasion, involvement of regional lymph nodes, and presence of distant metastases or second primary malignancies. The most common metastatic sites are the lungs, liver, and bone, while the most common sites of second primary malignancies are the head and neck, followed by the lungs and esophagus. Ideally, imaging should take place prior to biopsy, which may distort anatomy and create a false positive finding on PET scanning. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for distant metastases'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fine needle aspiration biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is frequently used to make an initial tissue diagnosis of a head and neck cancer when a patient presents with a neck mass (metastatic cervical lymph node) without an obvious primary <span class=\"nowrap\">mucosal/upper</span> aerodigestive tract site. This technique has high sensitivity and specificity and a diagnostic accuracy that ranges from 89 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Nondiagnostic aspirations occur in 5 to 16 percent of cases, most commonly in cystic neck masses, as is common in the presentation of patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancers. If an initial FNA is negative from a suspicious neck node, repeat FNA may be considered before doing an excisional biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary&quot;</a>.) </p><p>FNA biopsy of a suspected involved lymph node in the setting of an established primary tumor may provide relevant information when clinical and imaging evaluation of neck lymph nodes is equivocal and a positive or negative finding would change the clinical treatment approach (eg, radiation therapy field or dose, or the use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiation therapy alone). Several studies have compared ultrasound plus ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy with neck CT; the procedures were comparable in terms of overall accuracy (88 and 85 percent in one series compared with 69 percent by palpation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], while others noted better results with FNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In one report of 86 patients with clinically node-negative (N0) necks, ultrasound with FNA-detected malignancy in five who did not fulfill radiologic criteria for malignancy by CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Conversely, several enlarged nodes on CT scan were negative by cytology (ie, they potentially represented a false-positive finding). PET may also have a role in the evaluation of cervical lymph nodes, although PET scan will not identify <span class=\"nowrap\">occult/microscopic</span> disease. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'PET and integrated PET/CT'</a> below.)</p><p>Another promising strategy for increasing the accuracy of overall staging is sentinel lymph node biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. This procedure is usually performed at the same time as surgical resection of tumor. Like cutaneous melanoma, this technique utilizes preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative blue dye, and handheld gamma probe. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a reliable and reproducible method for staging the clinically and radiologically N0 neck in patients with early stage head and neck cancer. It also may have use in determining the best treatment for contralateral N0 neck in patients with midline malignancies and node positive ipsilateral disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is technically feasible, reliable (high sensitivity if the three highest intensity nodes are sampled), oncologically safe, and associated with less morbidity than elective neck dissection. This technique is becoming more widely used clinically in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies (CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], PET, and integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT)</span> are important for assessing the degree of local infiltration, involvement of regional lymph nodes, and presence of distant metastases or second primary tumors. </p><p>There is increased awareness of patient exposure to radiation dose during medical imaging. Although the overall risk of radiation-induced malignancy is small, it is non-negligible when population-based screening is considered. Previous literature estimates that approximately 1.5 to 2 percent of all cancers in the United States may be attributable to radiation from CT studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The risk estimation of CT radiation to individual patients is a difficult subject, as evolving CT technology continues to help reduce radiation dose and the risk of induced cancer decreases with patient age. The potential risk versus the anticipated benefits of CT scans must be taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT can identify tumors of the head and neck based upon either anatomic distortion or specific tumor enhancement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91084\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91084 \">image 1</a>). In general, tumors enhance more than normal head and neck structures except for mucosa, extraocular muscles, and blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Compared with MRI, CT provides greater spatial resolution, and can be performed with faster acquisition times, thereby virtually eliminating motion artifact, and it is better for the evaluation of bone destruction. </p><p>Modern multidetector CT technology allows scanning to be performed with slice thickness less than 1 mm. Slice thickness of 3 mm is generally optimal, while slice thickness greater than 5 mm does not offer sufficient spatial resolution. Images should be reconstructed and viewed in both soft tissue and bone windows. Dental amalgam can create severe beam hardening image artifacts that obscure image details in the scan plane. This problem can be remedied by rescanning the obscured area with angulated gantry.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary site</strong> &mdash; For cancers of the oral cavity, contrast-enhanced CT can help determine the extent of tumor infiltration into deep tongue musculature and whether or not the mandible is involved. The &quot;puffed cheek&quot; technique improves evaluation of lesions of the oral cavity. This technique requires patients to self-insufflate their oral cavity with air by puffing out their cheek [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For other head and neck cancers, CT is particularly useful in upstaging cancers that have deeper local invasion or infiltration into adjacent structures that is difficult to detect on physical examination. CT can provide information on invasion of the preepiglottic space, laryngeal cartilage, paraglottic space and subglottic extension, and can evaluate retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, upper mediastinal, and paratracheal nodes. In addition, bone and cartilage invasion, a criterion for stage T4 disease, can be more readily detected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Distinction of cartilage invasion from non-ossified cartilage can be a difficult task for conventional CT. The new technology of dual energy and multispectral CT has demonstrated improved accuracy for assessing cartilage invasion compared with conventional CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Preliminary results have demonstrated an increase of specificity for evaluation of thyroid cartilage invasion from 70 to 96 percent, with no compromise of sensitivity (86 versus 86 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In general, the advantage of improved tissue characterization offered by dual-energy and spectral CT may enhance the accuracy of CT for evaluation of tumor extent and staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one review of 81 patients with head and neck cancer, CT resulted in a change in assigned clinical stage in 54 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This was most likely to occur with hypopharyngeal tumors and least likely with glottic laryngeal tumors (90 and 16 percent, respectively). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Regional nodes</strong> &mdash; Imaging by CT or MRI is complementary to the clinical examination for the staging of the neck lymph nodes. CT evaluation of regional lymph nodes primarily relies upon size criteria as well as the appearance of lymph nodes to differentiate involved from uninvolved lymph nodes. The use of size criteria alone results in frequent false positive and false negative assessment of regional nodes. CT is also highly sensitive for detection of extracapsular spread of tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pathologic lymphadenopathy is usually defined radiologically as a node greater than 10 to 11 mm in minimal axial diameter or one that contains central necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The choice of how a lymph node is measured is often controversial and reflects a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. In general, size criteria based on measurement of minimal axial diameter are considered the most accurate and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], and probably the most reproducible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other features that suggest pathological lymph nodes include rounded shape, loss of normal fatty hilum, increased or heterogeneous contrast enhancement, lymph node clustering, and sentinel lymph node location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In one study, data from 47 consecutive patients with head and neck cancer (total of 53 neck dissections) were combined with findings from a 15-year MEDLINE review of the English-language literature to compare physical examination with CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. CT was superior to physical examination in terms of sensitivity (83 versus 74 percent), specificity (83 versus 81 percent), accuracy (83 versus 77 percent), and detection of pathologic cervical adenopathy (91 versus 75 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although CT is superior to physical examination, the use of size criteria and the presence of central necrosis are limitations that prevent detection of borderline-sized nodes, nonnecrotic nodes, or extracapsular spread confined within the radiologically-defined margin of nodes. These cannot be differentiated by CT from reactive or normal nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This is an important issue since microscopic or occult nodal adenopathy is not unusual in head and neck cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one series of 957 lymph nodes from patients with head and neck cancer, 102 (11 percent) harbored malignant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The following findings were noted in terms of nodes that would not be called malignant by CT:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sixty-seven percent of tumor-containing nodes were 10 mm or smaller.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Twenty percent of malignant nodes had extracapsular spread; almost one-third of these nodes were 10 mm or smaller and some were less than 5 mm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Central necrosis was found primarily in nodes larger than 20 mm, suggesting that it is a late event in metastatic adenopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extracapsular spread of nodal metastasis is an important prognostic factor that should be assessed on imaging. Imaging findings that suggest extracapsular spread of nodal metastasis include irregular border of the lymph node, infiltration of adjacent fat planes, and loss of cleavage plane with adjacent anatomical structures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI provides superior soft tissue definition compared with CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and can often provide information that is complementary to CT. For example, MRI can provide more accurate definition of tumors of the tongue and is more sensitive for superficial tumors. MRI is also better than CT for discriminating tumor from mucus and in detecting bone marrow invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. For this reason, MRI can be useful for evaluation of cartilage invasion, particularly for non-ossified cartilage that can pose difficulty for CT. On the other hand, CT scanning is better than MRI for detection of bone cortex invasion since MRI shows no bony detail. The availability of dual energy and multispectral CT, however, may decrease the advantage of MRI in cartilage evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], although a direct comparison between MRI and dual energy CT has not been reported.</p><p>MRI is superior to CT for evaluation of perineural spread, skull base invasion, and intracranial extension of head and neck cancer. MRI may also provide additional benefits compared with CT in the evaluation of the base of tongue and parotid glands. MRI scan is the imaging modality recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to evaluate skull base erosion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The most important imaging sequences for head and neck imaging include noncontrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression, and fat-suppressed fluid-sensitive sequences, such as T2-weighted images with fat suppression or short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) images. Images in axial and coronal plane are the most useful. For general purpose, slice thickness should be no more than 5 mm. Some applications, such as evaluation of skull base and perineural spread, may require thinner slice thickness, typically around 3 mm.</p><p>In most studies, CT scanning outperforms MRI for the detection of pathologic nodal metastases. The reported sensitivity of MRI is as low as 57 to 67 percent. However, neither test reliably detects clinically occult regional node involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">PET and integrated PET/CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With PET, injected positron-emitting radionuclides, such as fluorine-18, are taken up by metabolically or functionally active tissues. PET images are created by detecting these emissions by an array of detectors and then using reconstruction techniques to create a three dimensional image. The most commonly used agent is fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), which is taken up into cells in different concentrations depending on the relative metabolism of different tissues. It is fairly specific for tumors because metabolic rates are very high in many tumors.</p><p>Imaging of the primary tumor site and regional lymph nodes with PET is limited by its poor spatial resolution, which can make it difficult to localize the anatomic location of the FDG uptake. These issues can be at least partially addressed with integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging, in which PET and CT are performed sequentially during a single visit on a hybrid <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanner. The images are then coregistered using fusion software, enabling the physiologic data obtained on PET to be localized according to the anatomic CT images. </p><p>Historically, CT images obtained from integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanners had lower spatial resolution compared with dedicated CT scanners. This problem is now being overcome by new generation of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanners that offer volumetric CT capability</p><p>PET appears to be at least as sensitive and specific as CT and MRI in detecting primary head and neck tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. More importantly, PET is superior to both CT and MRI for detecting regional nodal metastases, as well as distant metastases and second primary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p>Despite these data, the value of PET is uncertain for patients with a clinically negative (N0) neck, a reflection of its limitations in detecting occult nodal metastases less than 5 mm. The sensitivity of PET is lower in this setting (25 to 51 percent in four separate studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]), although at least one series reports better results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Panendoscopy may not be needed if PET scan is performed, particularly when the PET scan is negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/8,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,83</a>]. For restaging of head and neck cancer after initial therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may provide additional benefits.
