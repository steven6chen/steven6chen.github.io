In the presence of severe underlying airflow obstruction, an exacerbation can cause respiratory failure and death.</p><p>Most exacerbations of COPD are due to respiratory infection. The role of antibiotic therapy in exacerbations of COPD will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, microbiology, and evaluation for infection in exacerbations of COPD are presented separately.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, which are broader than the original Anthonisen criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], recommend antibiotic therapy for patients who have the following features: a severe exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation (noninvasive or invasive) or an exacerbation with increased sputum purulence plus either increased dyspnea or increased sputum volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>We vary slightly from the GOLD guidelines in our clinical practices:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antibiotics in patients with a moderate to severe COPD exacerbation, which is defined as having at least two of these three symptoms (increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, or increased sputum purulence) or requiring hospitalization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do <strong>not</strong> initiate antibiotic therapy in patients whose exacerbation is mild, which we define as having only one of these three symptoms and not requiring hospitalization or ventilatory assistance (either invasive or noninvasive).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3490031468\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of antibiotic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal antibiotic regimen for the treatment of exacerbations of COPD has not been determined. We use a &quot;risk stratification&quot; approach when selecting initial antibiotic therapy. Specifically, we prescribe a broader antibiotic regimen for patients who have risk factors for a poor outcome. Risk factors include older age (&gt;65 years), comorbid conditions (especially cardiac disease), severe underlying COPD (defined as forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] &lt;50 percent), frequent exacerbations (two or more per year), and antimicrobial therapy within the past three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. This approach is illustrated in separate algorithms for selection of antibiotics in outpatients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66357\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66357 \">algorithm 1</a>) and inpatients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53537\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53537 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>The risk stratification scheme recognizes that some treatment failures are probably related to ineffective antibiotic treatment and that some patients with moderate or severe COPD cannot afford to experience treatment failure.</p><p>The same approach has been advocated for other community-acquired infections (eg, pneumonia, acute sinusitis) because it addresses concerns about disease heterogeneity, antibiotic resistance, and judicious antibiotic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. However, this approach has not been shown in prospective controlled trials to improve clinical outcomes.</p><p>The initial antibiotic regimen should target likely bacterial pathogens (<em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>) and take into account local patterns of antibiotic resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and Enterobacteriaceae can occur in patients with advanced COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. Additional risk factors for <em>Pseudomonas </em>infection include previous isolation of <em>P. aeruginosa </em>from sputum, concomitant bronchiectasis on computed tomography, frequent administration of antibiotics, frequent hospital admissions, and systemic glucocorticoid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients with COPD exacerbations are treated as outpatients. Among uncomplicated patients, who are unlikely to be hospitalized for an exacerbation, an advanced macrolide with anti-<em>Haemophilus</em> activity, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, or a cephalosporin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefpodoxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefpodoxime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefprozil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefprozil</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a>) are recommended antibiotic choices for COPD exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amoxicillin</a>, which was favored in the past, is no longer a recommended agent because it is inactivated by many nontypeable <em>H. influenzae</em> and most strains of <em>M. catarrhalis</em>. Among these agents, choice is based on previous patient antibiotic experience, adverse event profile, drug interactions, and sputum culture results (if available). If the patient has responded well and tolerated a certain antibiotic and that antibiotic use was more than three months prior, then the same agent (or same class) is a good choice. However, if the antibiotic exposure (for exacerbation or another indication) was within the past three months, then an agent of a different class should be used. Antibiotic exposure in the previous three months is one of the best predictors of resistant pathogens to that drug class in an individual patient.</p><p>In complicated outpatients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>) are recommended agents. Factors determining specific choice among these agents are similar to those above for uncomplicated patients. In addition, for patients with complicated COPD and risk factors for <em>Pseudomonas</em> who do not have indications for hospitalization, we generally use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> as it has better in vitro activity against <em>Pseudomonas</em> than levofloxacin or moxifloxacin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66357\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66357 \">algorithm 1</a>). In patients who are at risk for <em>Pseudomonas</em> who do not have microbiologic evidence of <em>Pseudomonas</em> infection, levofloxacin is a reasonable alternative. The rationale for using levofloxacin in this setting is that it has activity against <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and <em>M. catarrhalis</em> in addition to <em>Pseudomonas</em>.</p><p>For patients requiring hospitalization, there is a separate treatment algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53537\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53537 \">algorithm 2</a>). The antibiotic choice for such patients depends upon the risk of <em>Pseudomonas</em>. For hospitalized patients with risk factors for <em>Pseudomonas</em>, antibiotic choices include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>. Hospitalized patients without risk factors for <em>Pseudomonas</em> can be treated with a third-generation cephalosporin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>).</p><p>If a fluoroquinolone is used, clinicians must consider that fluoroquinolone use increases the risk of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection and may select for resistant bacteria, which could result in additional infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology#H402660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic use'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoroquinolones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fluoroquinolones&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both the macrolides and fluoroquinolones can cause a prolonged QT interval, which can result in torsades de pointes and death. Patients at particular risk for adverse effects of drug-induced QT prolongation include those with existing QT interval prolongation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, significant bradycardia, bradyarrhythmias, uncompensated heart failure, and those receiving certain antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>). Older adult patients may also be more susceptible to drug-associated QT interval prolongation. The decision of whether a macrolide or fluoroquinolone can be used safely should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risks for QT prolongation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 1</a>) and the need for an antibiotic with anti-<em>Pseudomonas</em> activity. For outpatients who have preexisting QT prolongation and do not require an agent with activity against <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> can be used since it has not been associated with QT interval prolongation. The beta-lactams outlined above can be used for inpatients.

On the basis of these studies, most clinical practice guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment of moderate to severe exacerbations. There is insufficient evidence to support antibiotic treatment of mild exacerbations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258310400\"><span class=\"h3\">Hospitalized patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a randomized trial of 93 patients with severe exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>) significantly decreased mortality (4 versus 22 percent with placebo) and significantly reduced the need for additional courses of antibiotics, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the duration of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a 2012 meta-analysis of 16 placebo-controlled trials, the beneficial effect of antibiotics was clearly demonstrated for severe exacerbations in terms of treatment failure and length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. High-quality evidence from only the single trial described above showed a mortality benefit in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Diarrhea was the most common adverse effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In the multivariate analysis of a retrospective cohort study that included 84,621 patients who were hospitalized patients with exacerbations of COPD, the risk of treatment failure was lower in those who received antibiotics during the first two hospital days compared with those who were treated later or not at all (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.92); treatment failure was a composite endpoint defined as the initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for exacerbations of COPD within 30 days of discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the multivariate analysis of another large retrospective cohort study, receipt of antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50-0.73) as well as a substantial reduction in the risk of 30-day readmission for COPD (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Another study examined whether there is additive benefit of antibiotics over that provided by systemic glucocorticoids in the treatment of moderate to severe exacerbations in hospitalized patients not requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this randomized trial of 265 exacerbations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> provided a significantly greater clinical success rate than placebo at 10 days (80 versus 69 percent). However, this difference was no longer statistically significant at 30 days (61 versus 53 percent). Doxycycline demonstrated limited microbiologic efficacy with only a 67 percent rate of bacteriologic eradication from expectorated sputum, although this was greater than the 37 percent rate seen with placebo. This may explain the substantial clinical failure rate of 39 percent at 30 days, even when patients received both antibiotics and glucocorticoids. Additional trials to address these issues are required.</p><p>A nonrandomized prospective study was conducted in 73 patients with COPD exacerbations admitted to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If patients had purulent sputum, they received antibiotics; otherwise, antibiotics were withheld. Clinical outcomes were similar in the two groups. However, the two groups were not matched, since those receiving antibiotics were more ill. Whether antibiotics can be safely withheld from patients with exacerbations of COPD admitted to the hospital who do not have purulent sputum is an important question that needs to be addressed in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258310507\"><span class=\"h3\">Outpatients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations is less well-established for outpatients than for inpatients. In the 2012 meta-analysis described above, in outpatients (with mild to moderate exacerbations), there was low-quality evidence that antibiotics significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (risk ratio [RR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.94), but antibiotics did not significantly reduce the risk when the meta-analysis was restricted to currently available drugs (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63-1.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>One of the largest and most rigorous trials was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 173 patients with 362 exacerbations over a three and one-half&ndash;year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Antibiotic therapy increased the likelihood of clinical improvement, defined as resolution of symptoms without additional intervention (68 versus 55 percent with placebo). Improvement was most frequent in patients with a severe exacerbation (63 versus 43 percent with placebo) and was not seen with a mild exacerbation.</p><p>A randomized trial showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> administration for COPD exacerbations demonstrated both short- and long-term benefits in outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When amoxicillin-clavulanate was administered rather than placebo, clinical success at day 10 increased from 81 to 91 percent, whereas clinical cure at day 10 increased from 60 to 74 percent. Median time to the next exacerbation was 233 days with amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 166 days with placebo.</p><p>A population-based cohort study evaluated the risk of subsequent COPD exacerbations among nearly 19,000 outpatients treated for an exacerbation with oral glucocorticoids with or without antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Median time to the second exacerbation was significantly longer among patients who received antibiotics plus oral glucocorticoids compared with those who received oral glucocorticoids alone (418 versus 321 days); median time between the second and third exacerbations was also longer (240 versus 127 days). Mortality during follow-up was also lower in patients who received antibiotics (hazard ratio 0.82, 99% CI 0.66-0.98).</p><p>A large trial compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> in exacerbations of COPD among outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The study population was carefully selected to meet the complicated COPD patient criteria; randomization was stratified by systemic glucocorticoid use, patients were followed for eight weeks, and the primary endpoint was clinical failure within an eight-week period. Clinical failure rates with moxifloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate were similar (21 versus 22 percent, respectively), demonstrating that both antibiotics are good choices in outpatients with COPD exacerbations. Failure of bacterial eradication at end of the antibiotic course was associated with clinical failure at eight weeks, demonstrating that bacterial eradication from the airways is associated with clinical benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparisons of antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trials that compared different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of COPD exacerbations are difficult to interpret without microbiologic data, which were often absent.

The macrolides included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, while the fluoroquinolones included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemifloxacin</a>. Antibiotic selection did not affect short-term treatment success, defined as resolution or improvement of symptoms. However, fluoroquinolones were associated with a higher rate of microbiologic success and, in the 26 weeks following therapy, a lower rate of recurrence. Amoxicillin-clavulanate was associated with more adverse effects (mostly diarrhea) than the other drug classes.</p><p>In a randomized trial that included 170 patients with exacerbations of COPD requiring mechanical ventilation, patients received a 10-day course of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Hospital mortality and the need for additional antibiotic prescriptions were similar in both groups, indicating that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was noninferior to ciprofloxacin. An important limitation of this study is that neither agent has optimal activity against bacteria that are commonly implicated in COPD exacerbations. For example, ciprofloxacin has inadequate activity against <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, whereas an appreciable percentage of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> isolates are resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Furthermore, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole does not have activity against <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. For these reasons, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend either regimen for patients with severe COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H619349333\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIVIRAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients whose COPD exacerbation was triggered by influenza virus should be treated with antiviral therapy according to current recommendations and based on the predicted susceptibility patterns of the circulating strains.

However, the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis must be weighed against concerns about promoting antibiotic resistance and possible adverse effects. For most patients with COPD, we suggest not administering antibiotic prophylaxis. Only carefully selected patients, such as those who continue to have frequent exacerbations in spite of optimal therapy for their COPD with bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents, should be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis. In such patients, we suggest prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>. Azithromycin can be given as 250 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] or at a lower dose of 250 to 500 mg three times per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. We often use 250 mg three times per week to reduce adverse effects, although this dose is less well studied. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> has demonstrated efficacy for the prevention of COPD exacerbations, we generally reserve it for the treatment of serious pulmonary infections in order to reduce the risk of selecting fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria and causing <em>C. difficile</em> infection.</p><p>When prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed, careful attention should be paid to contraindications, and patients should be closely monitored for adverse effects. Suspected bacterial exacerbations in patients on antibiotic prophylaxis should be treated with antibiotics that are from a different class than the prophylactic agent. Even if the regimen is successful in reducing exacerbations, interrupting treatment after 48 to 52 weeks should be considered. Interventions to prevent exacerbations of COPD that are unrelated to infection are discussed separately.

Specifically, cough increases in frequency and severity, sputum production increases in volume or changes character, and dyspnea increases. Most exacerbations of COPD are due to respiratory infection. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic therapy increases the likelihood of clinical improvement in patients with a moderate to severe exacerbation of COPD but have not been demonstrated to be of benefit for mild exacerbations. Among patients requiring mechanical ventilation, antibiotic therapy may provide a mortality benefit. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients whose exacerbation of COPD is mild (defined as not requiring hospitalization or mechanical ventilation and having only one of the three cardinal symptoms of increased dyspnea, sputum purulence, or sputum production), we suggest that antibiotics <strong>not</strong> be prescribed (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1682084685\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients whose exacerbation of COPD is moderate to severe (defined as requiring hospitalization or having at least two of the three cardinal symptoms), we recommend antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

We use a &quot;risk stratification&quot; approach when selecting initial antibiotic therapy. The initial antibiotic regimen should target likely bacterial pathogens and take into account local patterns of antibiotic resistance. This approach is illustrated in separate algorithms for selection of antibiotics in outpatients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66357\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66357 \">algorithm 1</a>) and inpatients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53537\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53537 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3490031468\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antibiotic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The usual duration of antibiotic therapy is three to seven days, depending upon the choice of agent and response to therapy. Given its long half-life, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> can be given for as few as three days when administered at a dose of 500 mg orally daily.
