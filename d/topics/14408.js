These reactions can be associated with endogenous or exogenous sources of progesterone. This topic will discuss the different types of reactions that have been attributed to progesterone hypersensitivity, what is known about pathogenesis, approaches to diagnosis, and interventions to alleviate symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1546099256\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progesterone is a steroid hormone derived from cholesterol and is the main progestogen in the human body. The term &quot;progestogen&quot; refers to any natural or synthetic form of progesterone. The term &quot;progestin&quot; is specific for synthetic progestogens. Progestins are functionally similar but structurally different from natural progesterone.</p><p>A variety of terms have been used in the medical literature to describe hypersensitivity reactions to progestogens, including &quot;autoimmune progesterone dermatitis,&quot; &quot;progesterone allergy,&quot; and &quot;progesterone hypersensitivity.&quot; The most commonly used term is &quot;autoimmune progesterone dermatitis,&quot; which was introduced in 1964 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, dermatitis is just one component in the range of reactions that have been reported, and progestogen hypersensitivity (PH) is not associated with other autoimmune diseases. Thus, the term &quot;progestogen hypersensitivity&quot; was subsequently proposed as a more accurate description of the multiple and varied reactions attributed to various forms of progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1011031665\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PH predominantly affects women of reproductive age, with an average age of onset in the late 20s among cases described in the literature. There is a single reported case of hypersensitivity in a male patient receiving the progestin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. PH appears to be rare, with fewer than 200 reported cases, although it may be under-recognized, and there are no published estimates of incidence or prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. PH has <strong>not</strong> been reported to develop in postmenopausal women treated with progestins as part of hormone replacement therapy (HRT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726724885\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGESTERONE BIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progesterone has multiple metabolic and physiologic effects related to the menstrual cycle, embryogenesis, pregnancy, and lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition to its role in reproduction, progesterone has anti-inflammatory properties and regulates T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In the normal menstrual cycle, progesterone is released from the corpus luteum during the luteal phase and contributes to changes in the endometrium that prepare the uterus for implantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62189 \">figure 1</a>). Progesterone levels begin to rise 24 to 48 hours prior to ovulation and reach maximum levels on day 20 to 21 of a 28-day cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels decrease, resulting in menstruation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If implantation occurs, progesterone remains elevated and suppresses the maternal immune response to facilitate pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Increased progesterone during gestation may also contribute to relaxation of uterine smooth muscle contractility and inhibition of lactation. Decreasing progesterone levels are believed to precipitate labor and lactation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3916949075\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of PH include both cutaneous and noncutaneous signs and symptoms.

The OC was discontinued and restarted two weeks later, resulting in a similar reaction, followed by three additional episodes of anaphylaxis of increasing severity while she remained on the OC.

Signs and symptoms appear during the peak progesterone levels of the luteal phase, most commonly 3 to 10 days before the onset of menses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62189 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].

It has been proposed that improvement during pregnancy may be due to either autodesensitization to progesterone as levels gradually rise during pregnancy or an attenuation of maternal immune responses during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The high-dose progesterone used during in vitro fertilization (IVF) is also associated with PH, and the resulting symptoms can limit the patient's ability to tolerate ongoing fertility treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Classic mast cell-mediated symptoms include urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. In this model, progestogen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies are formed, usually following exposure to exogenous progesterone or synthetic progestins used for contraception or hormonal supplementation. Most synthetic progestins are derived from adding or modifying the side chains of 19-nortestosterone, 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, or acetoxyprogestin, so it is plausible that these compounds are sufficiently different from natural progesterone as to be recognized as foreign by the immune system. When subsequent exposure to a progestogen occurs, patients react due to cross-linking of these IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cell <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basophils and activation of these cells. This mechanism is consistent with the observation that many cases of PH develop following exposure to the high doses of progesterone used in fertility treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/2,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence that immediate hypersensitivity plays a role in some cases of PH is supported by the presence of positive skin testing results to progesterone in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/14,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1455448517\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence of basophil and mast cell activation using functional assays also supports an IgE-mediated immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/1,10,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,43</a>]. In patients with immediate-type symptoms suggestive of PH but with negative skin prick testing to progesterone, it has been proposed that progesterone may modulate mast cell <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basophil reactivity, causing direct hormone-induced mast cell activation and release of bioactive mediators. However, studies evaluating the effect of estrogen and progesterone on basophil histamine release found that neither hormone influenced basophil histamine release. Mast cells have been shown to express receptors for both estradiol and progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. However, the effect of hormones on mast cells has not been studied directly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some forms of PH may result from delayed, cell-mediated (type IV) reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>). Some cases were supported by delayed reactions to skin prick or intracutaneous testing with progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/34,41,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,41,47</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1455448517\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patch testing is a form of testing that can provide information about contact allergies. In a study of 19 patients with contact dermatitis to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>, 5 of the 19 patients had positive patch testing to 17-alpha-progesterone. The authors posited that cross-sensitization to progesterone resulted from primary sensitization to corticosteroids with similar structures. However, only two of the five patch test-positive patients in this study had symptoms consistent with PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Furthermore, sensitivity to topical or oral corticosteroids does not seem to be a common finding among patients with PH, and these medications are sometimes used in the treatment of PH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe reactions consistent with cyclical Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which have been attributed to PH, are also considered a form of cell-mediated reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Testing is generally not performed for SJS reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The formation of progesterone-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, with immune complex formation and tissue deposition (a type III immunologic reaction), has also been implicated in PH.

There are several reports of rapid-dose escalation (&quot;desensitization&quot;) to high-dose progesterone that was required for IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. Varied protocols that require several hours to complete have been designed using oral, intravaginal, or intramuscular progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/2,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,15</a>]. Desensitization is timed to coordinate with fertility treatment, such as immediately prior to embryo transfer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F116118\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116118 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F115603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115603 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/2,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,15</a>]. Close coordination with the fertility specialist is essential. It is noteworthy that some of the reported cases of &quot;desensitization&quot; included premedication with steroids and other drugs, and no patients have been re-skin tested after tolerance to demonstrate cellular desensitization, so the mechanism underlying this clinical tolerance is not proven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24533078\"><span class=\"h3\">Women who have completed childbearing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who have completed childbearing, treatment options include rapid-dose escalation (&quot;desensitization&quot;) to and continuous use of an estrogen- and progesterone-containing OC until menopause. Alternatively, there are other options with significant drawbacks, including GnRH agonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, and oophorectomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GnRH agonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate, have been used to treat PH in patients with severe symptoms refractory to other medical therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/16,31,32,37,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,31,32,37,74,75</a>]. At doses used to suppress ovulation, GnRH agonists inhibit pituitary gonadotropin release, thus inhibiting ovulation and suppressing luteal progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In a double-blind crossover study in four women with history of recurrent anaphylaxis corresponding to the luteal phase, all received either GnRH agonists or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Two of the four patients improved on the GnRH agonist, while the other two had no response. The two who improved had positive skin tests to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> and anaphylaxis to intravenous challenge with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, consistent with PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. One of the authors (JB) has successfully used an intranasal GnRH agonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafarelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafarelin</a>) to control symptoms (unpublished). GnRH agonists have significant adverse effects, including hot flashes, amenorrhea, urogenital atrophy, and bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progestogen-hypersensitivity/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>].

In premenopausal women, tamoxifen induces ovulation, but if given daily over time, women can become oligo- or amenorrheic.

It can present with a spectrum of cutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic allergic signs and symptoms, correlating temporally with relative peaks in serum progesterone levels. (See <a href=\"#H1546099256\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1011031665\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the normal menstrual cycle, progesterone is released from the corpus luteum during the luteal phase (ie, days 14 to 28 of a 28-day cycle) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62189 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H726724885\" class=\"local\">'Progesterone biology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH may present with a broad array of cutaneous and systemic signs and symptoms. Most patients either have cutaneous presentations (dermatitis, urticaria, papular or vesicular eruptions) or <span class=\"nowrap\">asthma/anaphylaxis</span>. For women reacting to endogenous progesterone, the cyclical nature of the reactions relative to the menstrual cycle is a key diagnostic clue. Symptoms typically begin 3 to 10 days before the onset of menses and resolve after the first few days of menstruation. For women reacting to exogenous progestogens, the symptoms follow exposure. During pregnancy, PH can begin intrapartum and may or may not resolve following childbirth. (See <a href=\"#H3916949075\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heterogeneity of clinical presentations suggests that multiple mechanisms may be involved and that mechanisms may differ among patients. Types I, III, and IV reactions have all been implicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>). Women may have a history of exposure to exogenous progestogens, particularly during fertility treatment, but some patients have no such history, and risk factors have not been identified. (See <a href=\"#H3673050615\" class=\"local\">'Theories of pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation includes progesterone skin testing, if available. Positive skin testing results in the context of an appropriate clinical syndrome support the diagnosis, but negative results do not conclusively exclude it. Progesterone challenge has also been used but is infrequently performed. The minimal criteria for diagnosis of PH are suggestive signs and symptoms that appear during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or symptoms that correlate with exposure to exogenous progestogens. (See <a href=\"#H3351964366\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1406336750\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) taken in the perimenstrual period, chronic idiopathic (or spontaneous) urticaria (CIU), premenstrual exacerbations of other skin disorders, and several other rare conditions. (See <a href=\"#H1866172147\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management options include suppression of symptoms with antiallergy medications, progesterone desensitization, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>, therapies to suppress ovulation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate), use of a selective estrogen receptor modulator like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, and oophorectomy. Different approaches are used for women wishing to suppress symptoms but preserve future fertility, those actively undergoing fertility treatments, and those who have completed childbearing.
