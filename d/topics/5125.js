The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy increases with duration of diabetes. Additional risk factors include the level of glycemic control, the type of diabetes (historically, type 1 more than type 2), and the presence or absence of associated conditions such as hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, nephropathy, and pregnancy.</p><p>Several preventive and therapeutic interventions have been evaluated in an attempt to minimize the morbidity associated with diabetic retinopathy. Treatment of diabetic retinopathy is directed both at prevention (primarily by good glycemic control) and at treatment of established disease.</p><p>Strict glycemic control early in the course of diabetes and photocoagulation for vision-threatening disease are of primary importance. Vitrectomy can also be used to preserve vision in advanced cases and certain circumstances. Intravitreal pharmacologic therapies are important new modalities for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>Prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy will be reviewed here. The screening, pathogenesis, and clinical features of diabetic retinopathy are discussed elsewhere.

Additional risk factors include a lesser degree of glycemic control, the type of diabetes (historically, type 1 more than 2), and the presence of associated conditions such as hypertension, smoking, nephropathy, dyslipidemia, and pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In some populations, such as minority youth with type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is higher in patients with type 2 than type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although these risk factors are strongly predictive of the development and severity of retinopathy in populations, and controlling some of these risk factors is important for the prevention of retinopathy, it is difficult to predict the development of retinopathy in a particular individual. As an example, many patients are under the impression that they will not develop retinopathy if they maintain good glycemic control. While lower glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels are associated with a decreased risk of retinopathy development and progression, good glycemic control does not guarantee that retinopathy will not develop or preclude regular screening for diabetic retinopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61833 \">table 1</a>).

Most patients with type 2 diabetes will require treatment with statins to control hyperlipidemia; however, we do not specifically suggest lipid lowering therapy for the treatment or prevention of retinopathy. A reasonable glycemic goal for most patients is a glycated hemoglobin (A1C) &le;7 percent. However, this goal is not appropriate for all patients, especially older adults and those with comorbid conditions or limited life expectancy. A reasonable goal blood pressure is less than <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H15054361\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Monitoring and target A1C'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Blood pressure control'</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review of trials for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy showed that strict glycemic and blood pressure control were beneficial for the prevention and progression of retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast, the benefit of lipid lowering therapy to reduce the risk of retinopathy was less certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Lipid lowering therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In a subsequent study not included in the systematic review, the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Eye Study, the effect of intensive glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control on progression of diabetic retinopathy was evaluated in a subset of 2856 adults participating in the ACCORD trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Progression of diabetic retinopathy was defined by a three or more step progression on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Severity Scale or the development of proliferative retinopathy requiring photocoagulation or vitrectomy. At four years, progression of retinopathy occurred in 253 patients (8.9 percent). Among these patients, a three or more step progression on the ETDRS scale occurred in 69 percent, but only 12 percent of these patients required laser photocoagulation and 4 percent required vitrectomy. There was a reduction in the proportion of patients with progression of retinopathy in the intensive glycemic therapy group and the fenofibrate group but not in the intensive blood pressure control group. No benefits of any intervention were seen for moderate loss of vision. Additional details are provided below and elsewhere.

There are two issues related to the use of antihypertensive therapy in patients with diabetic retinopathy: &quot;What is the goal blood pressure?&quot; and &quot;Does angiotensin inhibition provide additional benefit as it does in diabetic nephropathy?&quot; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>). Although the trials described below suggest that good blood pressure control <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;140/90</span> mmHg) is important for prevention and for slowing progression of diabetic retinopathy, there are insufficient data to recommend a specific antihypertensive agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Goal blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More rigorous control of hypertension slows the rate of progression of diabetic retinopathy. This was illustrated in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), in which 1148 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to a goal blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150/85</span> mmHg or <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;180/105</span> mmHg with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> as primary therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The mean blood pressure at study entry was <span class=\"nowrap\">160/94</span> mmHg and the achieved mean blood pressures in the two groups were <span class=\"nowrap\">144/82</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">154/87</span> mmHg.</p><p>At eight to nine years, patients in the lower blood pressure group had a 24 percent reduction in diabetes-related end points and a 34 and 47 percent reduction in significant deterioration in retinopathy and visual acuity, respectively. Diastolic blood pressure may be a better predictor of progression of retinopathy than systolic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The attained blood pressures in UKPDS were higher than the currently recommended goal blood pressure in patients with diabetes. In subsequent trials, such as Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) and ACCORD, attained blood pressures were lower (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;140/80</span> in both the active intervention and control groups), and these trials did not show an effect on retinopathy outcomes. As an example, in the ACCORD Eye Study, baseline median systolic blood pressure was 137 mmHg, with achieved systolic blood pressures of 117 and 133 mmHg in the intensive and standard therapy groups, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There was no difference in progression of retinopathy between the two groups (10.4 versus 8.8, odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% CI 0.84-1.79), probably due to the relatively good blood pressure control in both groups. With the blood pressure levels achieved in the ACCORD Eye Study and in ADVANCE, longer-term follow-up may be necessary to show a protective effect of more aggressive blood pressure lowering. These trials are reviewed in detail separately.

There are insufficient data to recommend a specific antihypertensive agent.</p><p>The effect of angiotensin inhibition on prevention of diabetic retinopathy, independent of the benefits of blood pressure control, is unclear. Comparative trials have not found angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to be superior to a beta blocker or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nisoldipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nisoldipine</a> in hypertensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] or normotensive <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;140/90</span> mmHg) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Placebo-controlled trials have provided some evidence of benefit, but it was not possible to separate the effects of angiotensin inhibition from those due to blood pressure lowering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The best data come from the Diabetic Retinopathy <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Candesartan</a> Trials (DIRECT) Programme, which investigated the effects of candesartan on the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 diabetes and on progression in type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this multicenter international trial, normoalbuminuric normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes with (1905 subjects) or without (1421 subjects) baseline nonproliferative retinopathy and 1905 normoalbuminuric normotensive or treated hypertensive subjects with type 2 diabetes and nonproliferative retinopathy were randomly assigned to candesartan (32 mg daily) or placebo.</p><p>The following findings were noted in patients with type 1 diabetes (DIRECT-1) at a median follow-up of approximately 4.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients without retinopathy at baseline, new retinopathy (change in two or more ETDRS levels) was significantly less likely in patients assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a> (25 versus 31 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.67-1.00).

In a subgroup analysis, the chance of regression was significant only in those with mild retinopathy at baseline.</p><p/><p>The results from DIRECT-2 differ from earlier trials in that the decrease in blood pressure in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a> group was not associated with a reduction in progression of retinopathy. This may be due, at least in part, to the more stringent definition of progression of retinopathy in DIRECT-2 (increase in three or more ETDRS levels compared with one or two or more in earlier trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>In addition, the difference in mean blood pressure between the intervention and control groups was smaller and blood pressure control at baseline was similar or better in DIRECT-2 than in other trials in patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. The better blood pressure control in DIRECT-2 was associated with fewer retinopathy events, making it more difficult to show benefit from blood pressure reduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipid lowering therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with type 2 diabetes will require treatment with statins to control hyperlipidemia; however, we do not specifically suggest lipid lowering therapy for the treatment or prevention of retinopathy. The benefit of lipid lowering therapy for the prevention of diabetic retinopathy has not been well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>In large randomized trials of cholesterol lowering therapy for the prevention of heart disease, the effect of therapy on retinopathy progression has been included as a tertiary endpoint. As an example, in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial, 9795 patients ages 50 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive micronized fenofibrate 200 mg daily or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].The patients treated with fenofibrate were less likely than controls to require laser treatment and to experience progression of retinopathy. However, the study was limited by incomplete reporting of the severity of retinopathy and indications for laser therapy. In addition, there was a nonsignificant increase in coronary and all-cause mortality. The details of the primary cardiac outcomes of the FIELD trial are reviewed in detail elsewhere.</p><p>There are few lipid intervention trials that have assessed the development or progression of retinopathy as a primary outcome. In one such trial, 50 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and retinopathy (without clinically significant macular edema [ME]) were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> (20 mg daily) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. After six months, visual acuity and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography findings worsened in more patients in the placebo than simvastatin group (seven versus zero). These findings suggest that simvastatin may slow the progression of retinopathy.</p><p>In the ACCORD Eye Study described above, there was a reduction in the proportion of patients with progression of retinopathy in the fenofibrate group (6.5 versus 10.2 percent, OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Fenofibrate decreased triglyceride levels compared with placebo (120 versus 147 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.4 versus 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. A retrospective cohort study similarly showed a reduction in progression of retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with fibrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Further evaluation of fenofibrate for primary prevention or secondary intervention of diabetic retinopathy is warranted.</p><p>Because lipid abnormalities are common in patients with diabetes mellitus, and especially in type 2 diabetes, many patients with type 2 diabetes will require hypolipidemic therapy (a statin) to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The details of the protocol and overall results of this study are discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Carbonic anhydrase'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, calcium dobesilate, a drug that decreases capillary permeability, platelet aggregation, and blood viscosity, and that is used in some countries to treat chronic venous insufficiency and diabetic retinopathy, was not shown to prevent the occurrence of clinically significant ME in subjects with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13808748\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visual loss in nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy is primarily through the development of macular edema (ME) or macular ischemia.

The risk of rapid progression is often determined by funduscopic or angiographic findings.

Indications for panretinal photocoagulation treatment include high risk proliferative characteristics, rubeosis of the iris with or without neovascular glaucoma, moderate to severe neovascularization not involving the optic disc (especially in type 1 diabetic patients), and widespread retinal ischemia. Panretinal photocoagulation may also be considered if proliferative diabetic retinopathy is developing during a pregnancy or if preproliferative retinopathy is developing in the second eye of a type 1 diabetic with severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the other eye. Treatment considerations include individual response of the patient to previous laser treatment, any complications of the procedure (such as a decrease in visual fields), and other possibilities for additional therapy.</p><p>Laser photocoagulation makes use of wavelengths that pass through the ocular media but are absorbed by pigment in the retinal pigment epithelium, which underlies the transparent retina. Typical treatment includes 600 to 1600 burns, 500 micrometers in size, placed on the retina in a grid pattern that includes confluent coverage of neovascularization not involving the optic disc (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77583\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77583 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The efficacy of panretinal photocoagulation has been demonstrated in several randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>] and summarized in a 2007 systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the Diabetic Retinopathy Study, where 1758 diabetic patients with advanced retinopathy were assigned to panretinal photocoagulation in one eye (with the other eye being the control), the cumulative risk of developing severe visual loss at six years was reduced by more than 50 percent in the treated eyes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72517\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72517 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A similar magnitude of benefit was noted in the systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In a systematic review of the adverse visual effects of panretinal photocoagulation in patients with diabetic retinopathy, initial moderate visual loss occurred in a greater proportion of eyes treated with panretinal photocoagulation, particularly in the presence of pre-existing ME and less severe retinopathy (at four months, 9.7 versus 3.8 percent of eyes in the deferral group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In eyes with ME and more severe retinopathy, moderate visual loss (at six weeks) occurred in 7.7 percent of eyes treated with panretinal photocoagulation compared with 1.7 percent in the deferral group. However, panretinal photocoagulation decreased the five-year risk of severe visual loss in patients with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Panretinal photocoagulation'</a> above). In the same review, visual fields deteriorated in up to 50 percent of treated patients.</p><p>Pain during laser treatment is highly variable and depends in part upon the duration of the laser burns, pigmentation of the fundus, previous laser treatment, and patient anxiety. Similarly, the degree of visual field loss correlates with the percentage of retina ablated, the number of laser burns, the location and intensity of laser burns, and the patient's visual fields prior to laser treatment. Some impairment in dark adaptation is seen in approximately 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The functional significance of visual field loss and impairment in dark adaptation is highly variable, depending on the total area of retina treated, the level of retinopathy present, and other ocular comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for vitrectomy include vitreous hemorrhage that is nonclearing or prevents photocoagulation, traction retinal detachment involving the fovea, tangential traction of the macula resulting in visual loss, combined traction-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, rubeosis precluding panretinal photocoagulation, visual loss due to an epiretinal membrane or an opacified posterior vitreous face, and progressive neovascularization that is unresponsive to photocoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In such patients, we recommend early rather than delayed vitrectomy.</p><p>Failure of laser therapy (panretinal photocoagulation) to halt new vessel proliferation can result in severe visual impairment due to extensive vitreous hemorrhage. In addition to bleeding from fragile new vessels, vitreous hemorrhage can result from contraction of the vitreous or fibrovascular proliferation that leads to avulsion of a retinal vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74536\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74536 \">picture 2</a>). Blood behind the detached posterior vitreous face remains red and is absorbed over weeks to months. In contrast, blood in the formed vitreous can turn white over time and is absorbed more slowly. Removal of the opaque vitreous humor followed by photocoagulation to the retina can restore vision to the level that the retinal integrity permits.</p><p>Tractional retinal detachments can also occur as a result of vitreal contraction and fibrovascular proliferation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71858 \">picture 3</a>).

In these cases, the major goals of vitrectomy are to remove media opacities (such as vitreous hemorrhage or cataract), to relieve vitreous traction, and to provide adequate retinal ablation by means of effective endophotocoagulation. Postoperative complications can include corneal defects, cataract formation, hemorrhage, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, iris and angle neovascularization, and anterior hyaloidal fibrovascular proliferation.</p><p>Observational studies have shown that 66 to 78 percent of patients with vitreous hemorrhage alone will have improved vision six months postvitrectomy, as will 57 to 75 percent of patients with traction retinal detachment involving the fovea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/36-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-42</a>].</p><p>The timing of vitrectomy is important. The Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study trials have shown a benefit of early vitrectomy in some patients with advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy, as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of early vitrectomy versus conventional management in 370 eyes with advanced retinal changes and visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">10/200</span> or better, a greater proportion of eyes in the early vitrectomy group (44 versus 28 percent) had a visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">10/20</span> or better after four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

However, what follows are broad guidelines for the prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with diabetes, we recommend maintaining good glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [A1C] &le;7 percent) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Improved glycemic control reduces the risk and progression of retinopathy with no threshold effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycemic targets'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycemic targets'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We are aware that this goal is not appropriate for all patients, especially older adults and those with comorbid conditions or limited life expectancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>). In addition, the goal is not practical for all patients due to patient preferences regarding combination therapy, particularly insulin therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining good blood pressure is important for reducing the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Antihypertensive therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefit of lipid lowering therapy for the prevention of diabetic retinopathy has not been well established. Lipid abnormalities are common in patients with diabetes mellitus, and the optimal therapy of dyslipidemia to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease is discussed in detail separately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">severe/very</span> severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50486\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50486 \">table 2</a>) who are at risk for rapid progression, we suggest panretinal photocoagulation rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with mild and moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy are generally not treated, unless accompanied by clinically significant macular edema (ME). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Diabetic macular edema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with high-risk and severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50486\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50486 \">table 2</a>), we generally recommend panretinal photocoagulation rather than medical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Panretinal photocoagulation may also be considered for some patients with early proliferative diabetic retinopathy, including individuals at risk for rapid progression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62206 \">table 3</a>). Intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors may be used as initial treatment in compliant patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, with close follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Proliferative diabetic retinopathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Panretinal photocoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy with vitreous hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> traction involving the macula, we recommend early rather than delayed vitrectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Vitrectomy can also be considered in type 1 and type 2 patients with severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy unresponsive to panretinal photocoagulation, and as an adjunct to remove media opacity and permit adequate retinal laser ablation. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Vitrectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For initial therapy in most patients with clinically significant ME (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50486\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50486 \">table 2</a>), we recommend intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy rather than focal laser photocoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The choice of anti-VEGF agent by a retina specialist for an individual patient is based upon several factors, including baseline visual acuity, anatomic characteristics, ophthalmic history, planned future treatments for other aspects of diabetic retinopathy, and cost of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'VEGF inhibitors for ME'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Focal laser photocoagulation is an option for initial therapy in poorly compliant patients with clinically significant ME, who may not return for follow-up appointments. Such treatments are also an option for patients with severe or very severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and ME and in those with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and ME (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62206 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Diabetic macular edema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'VEGF inhibitors for ME'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The precise role for anti-VEGF therapy in combination with focal photocoagulation is unclear, and such treatment decisions should be made on an individual basis. The addition of focal laser photocoagulation to anti-VEGF therapy may be beneficial in eyes that do not respond to or have an incomplete response to anti-VEGF therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with clinically significant ME refractory to intravitreal anti-VEGF pharmacotherapy and photocoagulation and with evidence of vitreomacular traction, we suggest vitrectomy rather than continued medical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H6681989\" class=\"local\">'Vitrectomy for clinically significant ME'</a> above). In the absence of vitreomacular traction, some experts will still perform vitrectomy as a therapy of last resort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> may have some benefit in patients with refractory ME. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by an often transient response and an increased risk of side effects, including glaucoma and cataract. (See <a href=\"#H3693387\" class=\"local\">'Intravitreal glucocorticoids for ME'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiplatelet agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) can often be continued safely in patients undergoing ocular surgery. The decision to withhold <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiplatelet agents prior to surgery should be made on an individual basis, depending upon the indication for the anticoagulation. Other factors to consider include whether the patient is monocular or binocular or has risk factors for ocular hemorrhage, such as prior hemorrhage in the fellow eye. (See <a href=\"#H16508764\" class=\"local\">'Patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents may continue anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents safely.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Standards of medical care in diabetes--2015: summary of revisions.
