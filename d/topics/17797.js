Hypernatremia due to water loss is called <strong>dehydration</strong>. This is different from <strong>hypovolemia</strong>, in which both salt and water are lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Thus, in patients who have access to water, hypernatremia primarily occurs in those who are unable to sense thirst or respond to thirst normally. This is most commonly seen in infants and in adults with impaired mental status, particularly older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Older adult patients may also have a diminished thirst response to osmotic stimulation via an unknown mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Less commonly, hypernatremia results from the administration of salt in excess of water, as can occur with hypertonic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> therapy during a cardiac arrest, inadvertent intravenous administration of hypertonic saline during therapeutic abortion, or salt ingestion. Hypernatremia is particularly common in critical care units when patients are administered large amounts of fluid, which may be hypertonic to their ongoing fluid losses, to correct hypovolemia or hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H412163\" class=\"local\">'Risk of hyperglycemia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The foregoing regimens for chronic and acute hypernatremia are based upon the stepwise methods used to calculate the water deficit (presented in detail below). In general, a net positive balance of 3 mL of electrolyte-free water per kilogram of lean body weight will lower the serum sodium by approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1005225\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for our therapeutic approach'</a> below.)</p><p>The equation for chronic hypernatremia is designed to lower the serum sodium by 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in 24 hours. (12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in 24 hours is considered the maximum safe limit, and we have chosen 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in 24 hours to increase safety.) It is likely that this initial regimen will lower the serum sodium by less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in 24 hours as many patients have ongoing free water losses (eg, osmotic diuresis, diarrhea, nasogastric suction) that will reduce the net positive electrolyte-free water balance, thereby slowing the rate of correction. The rationale for this recommended rate of correction in chronic hypernatremia is provided below. (See <a href=\"#H12509322\" class=\"local\">'Rate of correction in chronic hypernatremia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3725314473\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with hypernatremia due to correction of hyperglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As hyperglycemia and hypovolemia are corrected in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, the serum sodium concentration will rise because of an osmotic shift of water from extracellular fluid into cells and because of loss of electrolyte-free water in the urine as excess glucose is excreted. In patients with severe hyperglycemia whose serum sodium concentration is normal or high on presentation, severe hypernatremia may emerge during the course of therapy.</p><p>There is no consensus on how this should be managed, and the rationale for our approach is presented below (see <a href=\"#H2427992036\" class=\"local\">'Rate of correction in hypernatremia associated with severe hyperglycemia'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral edema has been described in children and very young adults (ie, age less than 20 years) who have rapid correction of hyperglycemia and, therefore, hypertonicity. Accordingly, if hypernatremia develops as a consequence of correcting the hyperglycemia in young individuals, our goal is slow correction using the water repletion regimen described for patients with chronic hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"#H2255537440\" class=\"local\">'Patients with chronic hypernatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, cerebral edema has not been described in older individuals during rapid correction of hyperglycemia. Conversely, the relatively sudden onset of hypertonicity in older individuals caused either by severe hyperglycemia (due, for example, to hyperosmolar hyperglycemia) or by acute hypernatremia (due, for example, to salt poisoning) has been associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome. Accordingly, if hypernatremia develops as a consequence of correcting the hyperglycemia in older individuals, our goal is rapid correction at the rate described above for patients with acute hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"#H2925370327\" class=\"local\">'Patients with acute hypernatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because most of these patients are hypovolemic and hyperglycemic, with ongoing losses of sodium and water due to glycosuria, free water is usually administered as 0.45 percent saline rather than 5 percent dextrose in water; infusion of 0.45 percent saline at 6 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour will provide the same amount of electrolyte-free water as 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour of 5 percent dextrose in water.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459117431\"><span class=\"h2\">Remeasure the sodium and modify the regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The regimen for acute hypernatremia is designed to rapidly lower the serum sodium to normal (ie, 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> in less than 24 hours. During the rapid infusion of 5 percent dextrose in water (or 0.45 percent saline), repeated laboratory measurements are necessary every one to two hours to ensure that serum sodium concentration is falling at the desired rate, to avoid overshooting the desired endpoint, and to watch for hyperglycemia. In chronic hypernatremia, rapid infusion of free water is not necessary, and, with a slower rate of infusion, the need for frequent monitoring is much less. However, in all cases of hypernatremia, the fluid repletion regimen should be modified, if necessary, based upon the sequential measurements of serum sodium.</p><p>For the most commonly encountered patients with <strong>chronic hypernatremia</strong>, we suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remeasure the serum sodium four to six hours after the initial fluid repletion regimen is started.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the repeat serum sodium indicates that the target rate of correction has been attained, then the frequency of measurement can be reduced in most patients to every 12 to 24 hours. However, in patients who have large, ongoing water losses due, for example, to hyperglycemia and glucosuria or severe nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the serum sodium should be measured approximately every four hours during the first day of therapy to ensure that the fluid repletion regimen is adequate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the target rate of correction has not been attained (the rate of correction is either too fast or too slow), then the infusion rate should be modified and the serum sodium should be remeasured four to six hours after the modification has taken place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most commonly, the rate of correction is too slow (ie, the rate of reduction in serum sodium is less than 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This usually results from ongoing free water losses due to an osmotic diuresis (eg, hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, urea in patients recovering from azotemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]), diarrhea, vomiting, or nasogastric suction, although a higher-than-estimated total body water (TBW) could also contribute. In such cases, the volume of ongoing free water loss should be estimated, and this quantity should be added to the fluid repletion regimen. Estimation of ongoing free water losses is presented below. (See <a href=\"#H21881403\" class=\"local\">'Replacing both ongoing water losses and the water deficit'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Less commonly, the rate of correction is too fast. In such cases, the infusion can be stopped or slowed (and the infusion rate recalculated using the updated information). Excessively rapid correction of chronic hypernatremia is of greatest concern in infants because rapid correction is common in patients with very small body size and because hypernatremic infants often develop cerebral edema and seizures during overaggressive rehydration. In these patients, it may become necessary to therapeutically increase the serum sodium concentration again to ameliorate iatrogenic brain swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Rapid correction of hypernatremia is much less likely to occur in adults than in infants; in adults, cerebral edema as a complication of overaggressive therapy is mostly a theoretical concern, and there is an association between slow correction rates and increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. We do not recommend re-raising the serum sodium in adults if the desired maximal correction rate has been exceeded.</p><p/><p>Formulas designed to predict the change in serum sodium according to a given fluid regimen do <strong>not</strong> eliminate the need for careful monitoring of the serum sodium during therapy. These formulas often fail because they do not include insensible losses or urinary or gastrointestinal losses of electrolytes and water. Even formulas that include such variables are insufficiently accurate for clinical use because they cannot account for the following factors that impact the serum sodium concentration: rapid changes in fluid and electrolyte losses during therapy, internal exchanges between soluble and bound sodium stores, and shifts of water into and out of cells due to changes in intracellular osmolytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. We discourage the use of these formulas as the sole guide to therapy. They can, however, be useful in providing a rough estimate of the amount of electrolyte-free water that will be needed, and they can help identify unsuspected fluid losses when the actual change in serum sodium concentration deviates markedly from what is predicted.</p><p>The regimens presented above and the water deficit formula presented below are based upon an estimate of the TBW, which cannot be measured directly in the clinical setting. As a result, <strong>these equations only provide a guide</strong> to initial therapy, and <strong>serial measurements</strong> of the serum sodium are essential to determine the response to therapy. Limitations to the estimating equations are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1004884\" class=\"local\">'Initial fluid repletion regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Estimating the water deficit'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1005108\"><span class=\"h2\">Treating patients who also have hypovolemia or hypokalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many hypernatremic patients have concurrent extracellular fluid volume depletion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypokalemia (due, for example, to diarrhea or vomiting). Sodium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potassium can be added to the intravenous fluid as necessary to simultaneously correct the water and electrolyte deficits. However, the addition of sodium or potassium to the replacement fluid decreases the amount of free water that is being given.</p><p>If, for example, one-quarter isotonic saline (sodium concentration 39 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> is given, then only three-quarters of the solution is free water. In that case, the equation to calculate the initial fluid repletion regimen in a patient with chronic hypernatremia becomes: one-quarter isotonic saline at a rate of (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> x patient's weight in kg). If 40 mEq of potassium is also added because the patient is hypokalemic, then only approximately one-half of the solution is free water. In this setting, the equation to calculate the initial fluid repletion regimen becomes: one-quarter isotonic saline plus 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of potassium at a rate of (2.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> x patient's weight in kg).</p><p>An alternative to combining water and sodium (with or without potassium) into one solution is to use two intravenous solutions, one for free water and the other for sodium with or without potassium as an isosmotic solution. The major setting in which this might be important is in a patient with severe hypernatremia who also has clinical signs of marked hypovolemia. In this setting, there is a need for more rapid expansion of the extracellular fluid volume with isotonic saline, but the desired rate of correction of the hypernatremia has not changed. (See <a href=\"#H1840923\" class=\"local\">'Application to hypernatremia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412163\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of hyperglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential complication of the administration of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids at a rapid rate is the development of hyperglycemia. This is more likely to occur in patients who have diabetes mellitus or who are physiologically stressed, leading to the secretion of hormones that can raise the plasma glucose concentration (eg, epinephrine and cortisol). Hyperglycemia can lead to an osmotic diuresis, which creates electrolyte-free water losses that will limit the reduction in serum sodium. (See <a href=\"#H21881403\" class=\"local\">'Replacing both ongoing water losses and the water deficit'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Dextrose-induced hyperglycemia'</a>.)</p><p>Normal individuals (ie, no diabetes, not stressed) generally develop hyperglycemia when 5 percent glucose in water is infused at rates higher than 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a patient with a lean body weight of 70 kg, this threshold would be attained by the administration of 5 percent dextrose in water at an infusion rate of 250 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. The threshold would be lower in sick patients with high counterregulatory hormone levels and insulin resistance.</p><p>A 2.5 percent dextrose in water solution can be used in patients who develop hyperglycemia. However, this solution is not available in many hospitals. One option is to dilute 5 percent dextrose in water with an equal volume of distilled water. An alternative is to simultaneously infuse 5 percent dextrose in water and one-half isotonic saline in a 1:1 ratio through a single intravenous line using a Y-site connector, which will create an infusion that is 2.5 percent dextrose in one-quarter isotonic saline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1005225\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR OUR THERAPEUTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to therapy, presented above, is based upon a four-step determination of the water prescription for a patient with hypernatremia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimate the magnitude of the water deficit.

The vast majority of fatal or life-threatening cases of cerebral edema associated with DKA have been reported in patients under the age of 20 years, but there have been a few cases in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].

In patients with severe hyperglycemia whose serum sodium concentration is normal or high on presentation, severe hypernatremia is likely to emerge during the course of therapy. There is no consensus on how to manage such an increase in serum sodium in adults with nonketotic hyperglycemia. In contrast to the experience in children and young adults with DKA, life-threatening cerebral edema has not been reported after treatment of nonketotic hyperglycemia. However, hyperosmolar hyperglycemia has been associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome, which is thought to result from hypertonic injury to astrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Osmotic demyelination syndrome usually occurs in patients who have overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia (ie, a rapid increase in tonicity in hypotonic patients).

Similarly, it could be argued that the serum sodium concentration should be rapidly relowered with hypotonic fluid as it rises acutely during correction of hyperglycemia. We use this approach in adults with nonketotic hyperglycemia.

However, the sodium plus potassium concentration in most forms of diarrhea is between 40 and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> with organic solutes, which do not affect the plasma sodium concentration, making up the remaining osmoles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Unreplaced losses of this fluid will tend to raise the plasma sodium concentration since water is lost in excess of sodium plus potassium. As an example, this commonly occurs in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. By contrast, the sodium plus potassium concentration in secretory diarrheas (eg, cholera, VIPoma) is higher and may be similar to that in the plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Loss of these fluids will have no direct effect on the plasma sodium concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal losses'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sodium plus potassium concentration in vomitus and sweat is usually much lower than 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. In one study, for example, the sodium plus potassium concentration in gastric fluid was well below that in the plasma, averaging approximately 50 to 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypernatremia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, loss of this fluid will tend to raise the plasma sodium even though the fluid is isosmotic to plasma. Hydrochloric acid accounts for most of the gap between the osmolality of gastric fluid and the contribution of sodium and potassium.</p><p/><p>As described above, treatment of hypernatremia consists of correcting the free water deficit. Dextrose in water, which is isosmotic to plasma but electrolyte free, is most effective. In patients without diabetes mellitus, the glucose will usually be metabolized to carbon dioxide and water or stored as glycogen, neither of which contribute to osmolality. Thus, the osmotic effect is similar to the intake of free water.</p><p>However, many patients with hypernatremia have a reduced extracellular fluid volume, and some are also potassium depleted (due, for example, to vomiting or diarrhea). The administration of one-quarter or one-half isotonic saline at the same volume will produce a smaller reduction in plasma sodium than dextrose in water. The reduction in plasma sodium will be even less if potassium is added to the saline solution. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Designing the fluid repletion regimen'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, when considering either the etiology or treatment of hypernatremia, it is the <strong>sodium plus potassium</strong> concentration in the fluid lost or the fluid given, <strong>not the osmolality</strong>, that determines the effect on the plasma sodium concentration. In patients who are both hypernatremic and hypokalemic, the addition of potassium to the administered fluid will diminish the amount of electrolyte-free water that is given, thereby limiting the reduction in plasma sodium.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who present with hypernatremia usually have a serious underlying condition that impairs either their ability to respond to thirst or to experience thirst. As a result, such patients usually require hospitalization to correct the hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"#H447897394\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The therapeutic approach in patients with hypernatremia depends upon the rapidity by which the disorder developed and whether or not it was caused by correction of severe hyperglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F115660\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115660 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H1004884\" class=\"local\">'Initial fluid repletion regimen'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic hypernatremia &ndash; Hypernatremia is chronic if it has been present for longer than 48 hours. Nearly all patients with hypernatremia will have chronic hypernatremia, even those who present with acute changes in mentation who are discovered to have hypernatremia. The initial regimen in such patients is (see <a href=\"#H2255537440\" class=\"local\">'Patients with chronic hypernatremia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Five percent dextrose in water, intravenously, at a rate of (approximately 1.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> x patient's weight in kg) or approximately 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> in a 50 kg patient and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> in a 70 kg patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The goal of this regimen is to lower the serum sodium by a maximum of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a 24-hour period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients frequently have ongoing urinary or gastrointestinal water losses and also have obligatory losses from the skin and stool. When ongoing losses are present, an infusion rate based solely upon the water deficit will likely produce a rate of correction substantially less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per day. Thus, to achieve the target rate of correction, the fluid repletion regimen must also take into account replacement of ongoing free water losses. (See <a href=\"#H21881403\" class=\"local\">'Replacing both ongoing water losses and the water deficit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute hypernatremia &ndash; Hypernatremia is acute if it has been present for 48 hours or less. Acute hypernatremia is uncommon, occurring in patients with salt poisoning; in patients with diabetes insipidus who acutely lose the ability to replace their water losses (eg, a patient with diabetes insipidus who undergoes surgery and does not receive adequate intravenous water); and in patients being treated for severe hyperglycemia, whose water losses from glycosuria are not adequately replaced. The initial regimen in patients with acute salt poisoning or diabetes insipidus is (see <a href=\"#H2925370327\" class=\"local\">'Patients with acute hypernatremia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Five percent dextrose in water, intravenously, at a rate of 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The serum sodium and blood glucose should be monitored every one to two hours until the serum sodium is lowered below 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Once the serum sodium concentration has reached 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> the rate of infusion is reduced to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour and continued until normonatremia (140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> is restored.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The goal of this regimen is to lower the serum sodium by 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour and to restore normonatremia in less than 24 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with diabetes insipidus will also require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> therapy, which is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Hyperglycemia may develop with rapid infusions of 5 percent dextrose; to avoid increased water losses from glycosuria, a slower rate of infusion or a change to 2.5 percent dextrose in water may be required after several hours. (See <a href=\"#H412163\" class=\"local\">'Risk of hyperglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypernatremia due to correction of severe hyperglycemia &ndash; As hyperglycemia and hypovolemia are corrected in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, the serum sodium concentration will rise because of an osmotic shift of water from extracellular fluid into cells and because of loss of electrolyte-free water in the urine as excess glucose is excreted. There is no consensus on how this should be managed; our approach is (see <a href=\"#H3725314473\" class=\"local\">'Patients with hypernatremia due to correction of hyperglycemia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If hypernatremia develops as a consequence of correcting the hyperglycemia in young individuals, our goal is slow correction using the water repletion regimen described above for patients with chronic hypernatremia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If hypernatremia develops as a consequence of correcting the hyperglycemia in older individuals, our goal is rapid correction at the rate described above for patients with acute hypernatremia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Because most of these patients are hypovolemic and hyperglycemic, with ongoing losses of sodium and water due to glycosuria, free water is usually administered as 0.45 percent saline rather than 5 percent dextrose in water; infusion of 0.45 percent saline at 6 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour will provide the same amount of electrolyte-free water as 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour of 5 percent dextrose in water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During treatment of acute hypernatremia, repeated laboratory measurements are necessary every one to two hours to ensure that serum sodium concentration is falling at the desired rate, to avoid overshooting the desired endpoint, and to observe for hyperglycemia. During treatment of chronic hypernatremia, the serum sodium should be monitored every four to six hours after the fluid repletion regimen is initiated. If the repeat serum sodium indicates that the target rate of correction has been attained, then the frequency of measurement can be reduced in most patients to every 12 to 24 hours. However, in patients who have large, ongoing water losses due, for example, to hyperglycemia and glucosuria or severe nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the serum sodium should be measured approximately every four hours during the first day of therapy to ensure that the fluid repletion regimen is adequate. The fluid repletion regimen should be modified, if necessary, based upon the sequential measurements of serum sodium. (See <a href=\"#H459117431\" class=\"local\">'Remeasure the sodium and modify the regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The above fluid regimens can be altered to accommodate treatment of patients who have concurrent hypovolemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypokalemia or in those who develop hyperglycemia as a complication of the initial fluid regimen. (See <a href=\"#H1005108\" class=\"local\">'Treating patients who also have hypovolemia or hypokalemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H412163\" class=\"local\">'Risk of hyperglycemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21881413\" class=\"local\">'If concurrent electrolyte replacement is necessary'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Rose BD, Post TW.
