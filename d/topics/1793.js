Infection usually involves cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues but can occasionally occur in other sites, primarily in immunocompromised patients. Activities associated with the development of sporotrichosis include landscaping, rose gardening, and other activities that involve inoculation of soil through the skin.</p><p>The basic biology of <em>S. schenckii</em> and the epidemiology of sporotrichosis will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of this infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of sporotrichosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of sporotrichosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MYCOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>S. schenckii</em> is the primary pathogen in the genus <em>Sporothrix</em>, and most laboratories still identify isolates as <em>S. schenckii</em>. However, molecular studies have found that this species is actually made up of a complex of at least six phylogenetically different species that cluster in different geographic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. <em>S. schenckii sensu stricto</em> occurs worldwide and remains the most common human pathogen, but <em>Sporothrix</em> <em>brasiliensis</em> appears to be equally virulent and causes most infections in Brazil, including the large zoonotic outbreak related to cats in Rio de Janeiro. <em>Sporothrix globosa </em>is found worldwide but causes fewer infections than <em>S. schenckii</em> and <em>S. brasiliensis </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <em>Sporothrix mexicana</em>, present in Mexico and other Latin American countries, <em>Sporothrix luriei</em>, and <em>Sporothrix pallida</em> are less common causes of infection in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dimorphism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>S. schenckii</em> exhibits thermal dimorphism. It produces hyphae in the environment at temperatures that are lower than normal human body temperatures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81999\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81999 \">picture 1</a>) and exists as a yeast form at 37&ordm;C in vitro and in human tissues. Some strains are less thermotolerant than others, growing poorly at temperatures above 35&ordm;C; these strains tend to be found in fixed dermal lesions and do not have the propensity to spread along lymphatics into subcutaneous tissues as do most strains of <em>S. schenckii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth in vitro</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At 25 to 27&ordm;C, the filamentous form of <em>S. schenckii</em> grows readily on standard media, such as Sabouraud agar. Within one to two weeks, growth begins as a white- to cream-colored mold and then assumes a brown, gray, or black color with further incubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64948\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64948 \">picture 2</a>). With age, the colonies become wrinkled and, with repeated subculturing, may lose their dark color and turn off-white. The conidia may be dark colored or hyaline and arrange themselves along the hyphae in &quot;bouquet-like&quot; arrangements. The hyphae are thin, septate, and branched.</p><p>Growth of the yeast phase in vitro requires incubation at 37&ordm;C on enriched media, such as brain heart infusion agar. During yeast phase growth, the colonies are usually off-white and wrinkled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth in vivo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In human or animal tissues at 37&ordm;C, <em>S. schenckii</em> assumes a yeast-like form and reproduces by budding. The yeasts are usually 4 to 6 microns in diameter and variable in their shape; cigar-shaped yeast cells are classically described, but round and oval shaped yeast cells are also common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigenic structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cell wall of <em>S. schenckii</em>, as with most other pathogenic fungi, contains chitin, glucans, and mannans. However, unique to <em>S. schenckii</em> is the presence of L-rhamnose, in addition to mannose and glucose, as a major constituent of the glycopeptides in the cell wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">VIRULENCE AND IMMUNE RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>S. schenckii</em> is generally not considered a highly virulent fungus. Disease in humans is usually localized to cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues and has a subacute to chronic course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Experimental animal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory rodents, including rats, mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs, can be infected with <em>S. schenckii</em>. Experimental infection mimics natural infection, usually causing localized infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Those organisms that are isolated from fixed cutaneous lesions and that grow poorly at 37&ordm;C will multiply in colder areas, such as the testes, but rarely cause disseminated infection. Those strains that grow well at 37&ordm;C and have caused either extracutaneous or cutaneous lesions in humans spread and multiply in multiple internal organs as well as the testes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In a small study that involved the inoculation of mice with <em>S. schenckii</em> isolates from patients who had either disseminated or lymphocutaneous infection, differences in virulence depended on the type of infection in humans; only the isolates causing disseminated infection in humans were able to cause systemic infection and death in the mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of sporotrichosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Virulence factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The virulence factors of <em>S. schenckii</em> are not well understood. Components of the cell wall of <em>S. schenckii</em>, especially a 70 kDa glycoprotein (GP70), mediate adhesion to extracellular matrix and endothelial cell surface proteins, initiating invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Several extracellular proteinases are capable of hydrolyzing collagen and elastin and might be important for pathogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Melanin, found in <em>Sporothrix</em> species, is a likely virulence factor for this organism as well as many other fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immune response to <em>S. schenckii</em> is not completely understood. However, it appears that both antibody and cell-mediated immunity play a role, and the innate immune system is important in phagocytosis and killing of the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages are capable of ingesting and killing the yeast phase of <em>S. schenckii</em> in the presence of nonimmune human serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>]. </p><p>A role for T cells in containing infection is suggested by the observations that sporotrichosis is more severe in nude mice and that protection can be transferred by CD4 lymphocytes from immune mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, the infection tends to disseminate widely in patients with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], a characteristic seen rarely in normal hosts. Disseminated disease has also been reported in patients with hairy cell leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A role for cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon-gamma, has been noted in an experimental murine model of sporotrichosis and in one patient whose immunosuppressive therapy included the TNF-alpha antagonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>S. schenckii</em> is found worldwide in climates ranging from temperate to tropical.

Thus, infection is most frequent in persons whose vocation or avocation brings them into contact with the environment.</p><p>Activities associated with the development of sporotrichosis include landscaping, Christmas tree farming, rose gardening, topiary production, baling and using hay for packing materials or displays, and motor vehicle accidents that involve inoculation of soil into wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/10,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21-23</a>].

Most cases of transmission from animals to humans have been associated with cats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/20,24,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,26,27</a>], and sporotrichosis is an occupational hazard for veterinarians treating infected cats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In the highly endemic area in Peru, risk factors for infection among children were playing in fields, living in houses with dirt floors, and owning a cat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In Uruguay, a common history is that of a patient who describes hunting armadillos, receives scratches from the animal, and later develops skin lesions. In these cases, the armadillo is not infected but inoculates <em>S. schenckii</em>, which is present in nesting materials and the soil, into the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other cases have been ascribed to inoculation of the organism by insect stings, bird pecks, rodent bites, and by handling fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/24,26,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Outbreaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large outbreak of sporotrichosis involved contaminated timber in gold mines in Witwatersrand, South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Over a three-year period, nearly 3000 workers developed sporotrichosis, presumably after direct inoculation of the organism from wood splinters. In the United States, an outbreak involving 84 patients in 15 states was traced back to conifer seedlings that had been packed in sphagnum moss obtained from Wisconsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].
