Liquid-based, thin-layer preparation of cervical cytology specimens was a subsequent modification in technique. Terminology for reporting cervical cytology was standardized by the Bethesda System in 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The results of cervical cytology cannot be used to make a definitive diagnosis or initiate treatment, with the exception of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Rather, the test functions to screen for cellular abnormalities that are associated with an increased risk for the development of cervical cancer. The results are used to guide further evaluation, such as colposcopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cervical biopsy. Treatment decisions are then made based upon diagnostic results from histologic examination, usually from colposcopically directed biopsies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY FOR SQUAMOUS CELL ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been frequent modifications in the nomenclature used for classifying cytologic and histologic cervical changes associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and precancerous lesions. The major shifts in terminology apply to squamous cell abnormalities. The current classification system for cervical cytology was introduced with the Bethesda 1988 System [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This system has been updated several times as Bethesda 1991, Bethesda 2001, and Bethesda 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The corresponding terms across the current and previous terminology systems for squamous cell abnormalities are shown here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60116 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Squamous cervical cytologic abnormalities (those detected with Pap tests) are reported using the term cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (CSIL). Specifying &quot;cervical&quot; differentiates these lesions from anal squamous intraepithelial lesions, which use similar terminology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions: Diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CSIL is stratified into two categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL)</p><p/><p>The shift in terminology to LSIL and HSIL was made in the Bethesda 1988 system in recognition of the differing clinical course of these two levels of cellular change. LSIL, especially in young women, is generally a transient HPV infection, whereas HSIL is more likely to be associated with persistent HPV infection and a higher risk of progression to cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p>Cytologic abnormalities must be further evaluated with colposcopy and biopsy. The finding of LSIL versus HSIL on cytology does not constitute a diagnosis of a histologic abnormality such as LSIL <span class=\"nowrap\">(condyloma/cervical</span> intraepithelial lesion [CIN] 1) or HSIL (CIN <span class=\"nowrap\">2/CIN</span> 3). Cytologic findings may be associated with a subsequent histologic finding that is either more or less severe.</p><p>In 2012, the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) project of the College of American Pathology and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) published changes in the terminology used to describe HPV-associated squamous lesions of the anogenital tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60116 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Current terminology for histologic squamous cell abnormalities is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p>Current terminology for glandular cell findings is described in a section below.

An adequate TZ sample requires at least 10 well-preserved endocervical or squamous metaplastic cells.</p><p>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of cytology specimens lack an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component. This finding is most common in adolescents and postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Concerns have been raised that samples may result in a missed diagnosis of cellular abnormalities, but there is no evidence that the absence of an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component is associated with an increased risk of undetected cervical neoplasia.</p><p>The squamocolumnar junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105122 \">picture 1</a>) is the junction between the squamous and glandular cells, generally at the external cervical os. The TZ is an area of squamous metaplasia that forms the border between the squamocolumnar junction and the rest of the squamous epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The squamocolumnar junction of the cervix and the TZ are the areas at greatest risk for neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a cervical cytology specimen, the presence of metaplastic cells from the TZ or the presence of EC implies that the region at greatest empiric risk was sampled. The role of the TZ in the pathogenesis of cervical neoplasia is discussed separately.

It appears that women with this finding are <strong>not</strong> at an increased risk of cervical neoplasia; studies show no increase in the development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cancer in these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/13,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21-23</a>]. </p><p>Some of the controversy is based on data that suggest that the absence of this component in a sample is associated with a lower rate of reporting of abnormal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/13,18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18,20</a>]. This raises concern for a missed diagnosis of cervical neoplasia, particularly glandular abnormalities of the endocervix.</p><p>This was best illustrated in a prospective study of over 4000 women in whom cervical cytology specimens without an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component were found to have a significantly lower rate of epithelial abnormalities than specimens with an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component (11 versus 18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>However, when cervical cytology is repeated in women who have had a Pap test without an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component, data suggest that there is no increase in cellular abnormalities compared with other women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>]. This was illustrated in the prospective study of 4000 women described in a preceding paragraph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Repeat cytology performed after a median of 60 days (range, 13 to 991 days) showed no significant difference in the rate of epithelial abnormalities in women without or with an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component on the initial specimen.</p><p>In addition, longitudinal studies (six months to eight years of follow-up) of 40,000 to 60,000 women with a Pap test that was reported as negative for epithelial abnormalities but lacked an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component found no increase in histologic diagnoses of high-grade CIN or cervical cancer compared with women with an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component (in one study, for high-grade CIN, 0.6 to 2.6 versus 2.9 per 1000 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; in the other study, for high-grade CIN, 6.2 versus 6.1 per 1000 years of follow-up and for cervical cancer, 0.53 versus 0.54 per 1000 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]).</p><p>On the other hand, the proportion of endocervical adenocarcinoma among all cervical carcinomas is increasing. Since these cancers most commonly arise in the glandular cells of the endocervix, it is plausible that the detection of such cancers may be reduced in specimens that lack an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, glandular abnormalities are less common than squamous abnormalities, and there are few data to support or refute this concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26</a>].</p><p>The advent of testing for oncogenic HPV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76394 \">table 2</a>) has not clarified this issue. A potentially clinically important group is women with cytology that is negative, but lacks an <span class=\"nowrap\">EC/TZ</span> component, and a positive HPV test. It is unknown whether abnormal endocervical cells have been missed in these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The evaluation of a finding of BEC should be guided by menopausal status and abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms. However, the Bethesda guidelines use an age criterion because it can be difficult to determine menopausal status. Women for whom menopausal status is uncertain should be evaluated as if they are postmenopausal.</p><p>The age criterion was set at &ge;40 years in the Bethesda 2001 system to capture as many postmenopausal women as possible; however, this was not found to have a high positive predictive value for endometrial neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/5,6,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,42</a>].

The prevalence is significantly higher in liquid-based than conventional cytology (0.9 versus 0.3 percent); liquid-based cytology is more commonly used in current practice in most high-resource countries.</p><p>The presence of BEC may reflect physiologic shedding (especially in the first half of the menstrual cycle) or shedding in response to a pathologic process. Large literature reviews of BEC in women over age 40 have reported that 7 to 16 percent of cervical cytology specimens with this finding were associated with endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma upon further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>Bethesda guidelines advise that BEC should be reported regardless of the last menstrual period date. The prevalence of a finding of BEC varies with the menstrual cycle. Combined results from two large studies showed that BEC are more likely to be identified on cervicovaginal cytology tests in the first 10 to 12 days of the menstrual cycle (prevalence, 21 to 24 percent) than in the remainder of the cycle (prevalence, 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>The increased risk of endometrial neoplasia in postmenopausal women with BEC was illustrated in a retrospective study of 400 Pap tests with BEC in women &ge;40 years that included 161 postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-and-vaginal-cytology-interpretation-of-results-pap-test-report/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Among these women, the rate of endometrial carcinoma and its precursors was higher in women with BEC than other women. This included both women with postmenopausal bleeding (BEC: 16.4 versus 10.9 percent) as well as without postmenopausal bleeding (7.6 versus 0 percent).</p><p>Abnormal uterine bleeding is the main symptom of endometrial neoplasia and warrants further evaluation.
