Doppler echocardiography is based upon the changes in frequency of the backscatter signal from small moving structures (ie, red blood cells) intercepted by the ultrasound beam.</p><p>The principles of Doppler echocardiography will be reviewed here. The principles of other echocardiographic techniques, as well as the normal views and protocol for an echocardiogram, are discussed elsewhere.

This Doppler phenomenon is familiar to us as the sound of a train whistle as it moves toward (higher frequency) or away (lower frequency) from the observer. This difference in frequency between the transmitted frequency (F[t]) and received frequency (F[r]) is the Doppler shift:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Doppler shift (F[d]) &#160;= &#160;F[r] &#160;- &#160;F[t]</p></div></div><p>Blood flow velocity (V) is related to the Doppler shift by the speed of sound in blood (C) and &oslash;, the intercept angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow. A factor of 2 is used to correct for the &quot;round-trip&quot; transit time to and from the transducer.</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>F[d] &#160;= &#160;2 &#160;x &#160;F[t] &#160;x &#160;[(V &#160;x &#160;cos &oslash;)] &#160;&divide; &#160;C</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>This equation can be solved for V, by substituting (F[r] &#160;- &#160;F[t]) for F[d]:</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>V &#160;= &#160;[(F[r] -F[t]) &#160;x &#160;C] &#160;&divide; &#160;(2 &#160;x &#160;F[t] &#160;x &#160;cos &oslash;)</p></div></div><p>Note that the angle of the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow are critically important in the calculation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52145 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For &oslash; of 0&ordm; and 180&ordm; (parallel with blood flow), cosine &oslash; = 1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For &oslash; of 90&ordm; (perpendicular to blood flow), cosine &oslash; = 0 and the Doppler shift is 0</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For &oslash; up to 20&ordm;, cos &oslash; results in a minimal (less than 10 percent) change in the Doppler shift</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For &oslash; of 60&ordm;, cosine &oslash; = 0.50</p><p/><p>The value of &oslash; is particularly important for accurate assessment of high velocity jets, which occur in aortic stenosis or tricuspid regurgitation in persons with pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. It is generally assumed that &oslash; is 0&ordm; and cos &oslash; is therefore 1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectral analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the backscattered signal is received by the transducer, the difference between the transmitted and backscattered signal is determined by comparing the two waveforms with the frequency content analyzed by fast Fourier transform (FFT). The display generated by this frequency analysis is termed spectral analysis. By convention, time is displayed on the x (horizontal) axis and frequency shift on the y (vertical) axis. Shifts toward the transducer are represented as &quot;positive&quot; deflections from the &quot;zero&quot; baseline, and shifts away from the transducer are displayed as &quot;negative&quot; deflections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81517\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81517 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Multiple frequencies exist at every time point. Each received frequency is displayed, with the magnitude (or amplitude) shown as the &quot;brightness&quot; of each frequency shift component.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DOPPLER MODALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several Doppler methods used for cardiac evaluation: continuous wave, pulsed wave, and color flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous wave Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous wave Doppler employs two dedicated ultrasound crystals: one for continuous transmission and a second for continuous reception of ultrasound signals. This permits measurement of very high frequency Doppler shifts or velocities. The &quot;cost&quot; is that this technique receives a continuous signal along the entire length of the ultrasound beam. Thus, there may be overlap in certain settings, such as stenoses in series (eg, left ventricular outflow tract gradient and aortic stenosis) or flows that are in close <span class=\"nowrap\">proximity/alignment</span> (eg, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation). Differentiation of the signal from each component may still be determined from the characteristic timing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> profile.</p><p>An ideal Doppler profile is one with a smooth &quot;outer&quot; contour, well-defined edge and maximum velocity, and abrupt onset and termination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F112888\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef112888 \">waveform 1</a>). The continuous wave Doppler profile is usually &quot;filled in&quot; because lower-velocity signals proximal and distal to the point of maximum velocity are also recorded. Although the maximum frequency shift depends on &oslash;, the profile, onset, and termination of the Doppler signal are not dependent upon this value, resulting in inappropriate underestimation of true velocity. For this reason, continuous wave Doppler positioning is often integrated with two-dimensional (2D) and color flow imaging to allow for good alignment with flow (ie, &oslash; less than 20&ordm;).</p><p>Continuous wave Doppler is typically used to measure higher velocities as in pulmonary hypertension and aortic stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76308\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76308 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63455\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63455 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulsed Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to continuous wave Doppler, which records signal along the entire length of the ultrasound beam, pulsed wave Doppler permits sampling of local blood flow velocities about a specific region. This modality is particularly useful for assessing the relatively low velocity flows associated with transmitral or transtricuspid blood flow, pulmonary venous flow, left atrial appendage flow, or for confirming the location of eccentric jets of aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87117\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87117 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81391\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81391 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>To permit this, a pulse of ultrasound is transmitted and then the receiver &quot;listens&quot; during a subsequent interval defined by the distance from the transmitter and the sample site. This transducer mode of transmit-wait-receive is repeated at an interval termed the pulse-repetition frequency (PRF). The PRF is therefore depth-dependent, being greater for near regions and lower for distant or deeper regions.</p><p>The distance from the transmitter to the region of interest is called the sample volume, with the width and length of the sample volume varied by adjusting the length of the transducer &quot;receive&quot; interval. In contrast to continuous wave Doppler, which is sometimes performed without 2D guidance, pulsed Doppler is always performed with 2D guidance to determine the sample volume position</p><p>Because pulsed wave Doppler echo repeatedly samples the returning signal, there is a maximum limit to the frequency shift or velocity that can be measured unambiguously. Correct identification of the frequency of an ultrasound waveform requires sampling at least twice per wavelength. Thus, the maximum detectable frequency shift or the Nyquist limit is one-half the PRF. If the velocity of interest exceeds the Nyquist limit, &quot;wraparound&quot; of the signal occurs first into the reverse channel, then back to the forward channel; this is known as aliasing.</p><p>Techniques that can minimize aliasing during pulsed Doppler include using a lower frequency transducer and shifting the baseline. Another solution is to increase the number of sample volumes, or high PRF. As noted above, when a pulse is transmitted, backscatter along the entire length of the beam is received. Depth resolution is achieved with pulsed Doppler using the duration of the &quot;wait&quot; period. However, signals from exactly twice (or 3x, 4x, etc) the distance will reach the transducer during the &quot;receive&quot; phase of the next (or subsequent) cycle. As a result, signals from 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, etc have the potential for confounding the analysis.</p><p>The latter signals are generally of low amplitude and do not interfere with the spectral display. If, however, the sample volume is deliberately placed at one-half the depth of interest, backscattered signals from the 2x sample volume, the true depth of interest, will return to the transducer during the &quot;receive&quot; phase of the following cycle. This recording of signal at a higher PRF permits measurement of higher velocities without signal averaging. Even greater velocities could be achieved using additional sample volumes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Color flow imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler color flow imaging is based upon the principles of pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography. Along each scan line, a pulse of ultrasound is transmitted, and the backscattered signals are then received from each &quot;gate&quot; or sample volume along each line. In order to calculate accurate velocity data, several bursts along each scan line are used, known as the burst length. The process is performed for each scan line across the image plane. As with pulsed Doppler, the PRF is determined by the maximum depth of the Doppler signals.</p><p>With color flow imaging, velocities are displayed using a color scale, with flow toward the transducer typically displayed in <strong><span class=\"nowrap\">orange/red</strong></span> and flow away from the transducer displayed as <strong>blue</strong>. Lighter shades are assigned higher velocities within the Nyquist limit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54278%7ECARD%2F68049\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54278 graphicRef68049 \">image 3A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57208%7ECARD%2F68945\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57208 graphicRef68945 \">image 4A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75366\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75366 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59244\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59244 \">image 6</a>).</p><p>At the Nyquist limit, and each multiple of the limit, aliasing is depicted as color reversal. Turbulent flow is characterized by varied blood velocities and directions. The variance of velocities within jets is usually color coded as <strong>green</strong>.</p><p>Color flow imaging is typically used in the screening and assessment of regurgitant flows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79069\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79069 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55534%7ECARD%2F77039\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55534 graphicRef77039 \">image 8A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65598\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65598 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80498\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80498 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70063\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef70063 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76115\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76115 \">movie 4</a>). It is also useful in the assessment of intracardiac shunts (eg, atrial and ventricular septal defects) and pulmonary vein flow, and to assist in continuous wave Doppler alignment for tricuspid regurgitation velocities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOPPLER VELOCITY AND PRESSURE GRADIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most powerful attributes of Doppler echocardiography is the ability to estimate the pressure difference across a stenotic valve (eg, aortic stenosis) or between two chambers (eg, estimation of the pulmonary artery systolic pressure from the tricuspid regurgitation velocity). This relationship is defined by the Bernoulli equation and is dependent on the velocity proximal to a stenosis (V1), velocity in the stenotic jet (V2), density of blood (p), acceleration of blood through the orifice <span class=\"nowrap\">(dv/dt),</span> and viscous losses (R[v]). The pressure gradient <span class=\"nowrap\">(&Delta;P)</span> can be calculated from:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p><span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;P</span> &#160;= &#160;[0.5 &#160;x &#160;p &#160;x &#160;(V2 x V2 - V1 x V1)] &#160;+ &#160;[p &#160;x &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">(dv/dt)]</span> &#160;+ &#160;R[v]</p></div></div><p>If one assumes that the last two terms (acceleration and viscous losses) are small and then enters the constants, the formula is simplified to:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p><span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;P</span> (mmHg) &#160;= &#160;4 &#160;x &#160;(V2 x V2 - V1 x V1)</p></div></div><p>In most settings, V2 is greater than V1 by a factor of three or more. Thus, the terms (V2 x V2 - V1 x V1) are close to V2 x V2. As an example, 3 x 3 - 1 x 1 = 9 &ndash; 1, which is almost equal to 9.</p><p>Thus, the Bernoulli formula may be further simplified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63058\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63058 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52855%7ECARD%2F60384\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52855 graphicRef60384 \">waveform 3A-B</a>):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p><span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;P</span> (mmHg) &#160;= &#160;4 &#160;x &#160;V2 x V2</p></div></div><p>It is important to remember that this simplified Bernoulli formula measures the <strong>pressure difference</strong>, not the absolute pressure. In addition, it is imperative that accurate measurement of V2 be obtained. Due to the squaring of V2, a 10 percent error in V2 will result in a 20 percent error in the pressure estimate.
