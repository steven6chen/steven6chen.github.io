They are found in approximately 1 percent of appendectomy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and account for only approximately one-half of 1 percent of intestinal neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Carcinoid tumors are the most common, comprising over 50 percent of appendiceal neoplasms in most series (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69317\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69317 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>However, the distribution of appendiceal neoplasms might be changing over time. In a large series of appendiceal tumors derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute between 1973 to 2003, the most frequent histology was a mucinous adenocarcinoma followed by intestinal-type adenocarcinoma; carcinoid tumors comprised only 11 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55911\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55911 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The difference in natural history of these different histologies is illustrated by their differing five-year disease-specific survival rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;carcinoid&quot; has generally applied to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) originating in the digestive tract, lungs, or rare primary sites, such as kidneys or ovaries. Use of the term carcinoid usually implies a well-differentiated histology; in modern terminology, the rare high-grade or poorly differentiated NETs are referred to as neuroendocrine carcinomas.

These substances are responsible for the carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by episodic flushing, wheezing, diarrhea, and right-sided valvular heart disease. Midgut NETs (ie, appendix, small bowel) are more commonly associated with the classic carcinoid syndrome than those that arise in the foregut or hindgut (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56015 \">table 4</a>). More than 90 percent of patients with carcinoid syndrome have metastatic disease, typically to the liver.

As a result, most patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms are more likely with large tumors and with metastases beyond the regional lymph nodes. Approximately 10 percent of appendiceal NETs are located at the base of the appendix, where they can cause obstruction, leading to appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The endoscopic appearance of appendiceal NETs is pictured in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79971\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79971 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual contained a tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for well-differentiated appendiceal NETs for the first time; the most recent version (eighth edition, 2017) is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111126 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

As a general rule, serum concentration of chromogranin A (CGA, a protein that is stored and released with peptides and amines in NETs) parallel 5-HIAA excretion. Although serum levels of CGA are a more sensitive marker than urinary 5-HIAA for gastroenteropancreatic NETs, including those arising in the appendix; they are less specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Elevated CGA levels are present in a number of other conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73287\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73287 \">table 6</a>), and specificity depends on the cutoff value.

Tumors less than 2 cm (found in approximately 95 percent of patients) are unlikely to have metastasized, while up to one-third of larger lesions are metastatic at diagnosis but usually to regional nodes rather than the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/8,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11-13</a>]. In one series of 150 patients with appendiceal NETs from the Mayo Clinic, none of the 127 patients with tumors &lt;2 cm metastasized compared with 3 of 14 with tumors 2 to 3 cm and four of nine with tumors larger than 4 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Outcome is stage dependent.

Because most are discovered incidentally in an appendectomy specimen done for other reasons, a decision must be made whether or not to return the patient to the operating room for a right colectomy. Unlike simple appendectomy, colectomy removes the draining lymph nodes of the appendix and any residual disease that might remain at the base of the appendix or in the mesoappendix.</p><p>Data from the large Mayo Clinic series cited above suggest that tumor size is an important determinant of the need for further surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. None of the 120 patients with tumors less than 2 cm developed disease recurrence after simple appendectomy compared with 1 of 12 with a larger tumor. Furthermore, in a compilation of reports from single centers, and large population and literature surveys, the risk of nodal metastases was 0, 7.5, and 33 percent for patients with appendiceal NETs &lt;1.0, 1 to 1.9, and &gt;2 cm, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82306 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>These data, taken together with the fact that as many as 88 percent of those with regional nodal metastases survive for five years or longer, support the view that patients with tumors &gt;2 cm in size should undergo right colectomy.</p><p>On the other hand, whether or not a colectomy should be performed in some patients with smaller tumors is unclear: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the Mayo Clinic series suggests that appendectomy is sufficient in such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], at least two reports demonstrate a higher potential for metastatic spread with small tumors in the setting of mesoappendiceal invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of the SEER database of the National Cancer institute reported much higher rates of lymph node metastases than previously appreciated for tumors &lt;2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among patients reported to the database between 1988 and 2003, lymph node metastases were found in 15 percent of patients (4 of 27) with typical appendiceal NETs less than 1 cm and in 47 percent of patients (16 of 34) with NETs between 1.0 and 1.9 cm. The 10-year survival in these two groups was 100 and 92 percent, respectively, while it was 91 percent in patients with NETs &gt;2 cm, despite the fact that 86 percent of them had lymph node metastases.&nbsp;Whether these excellent outcomes reflected favorable biology or the impact of surgical removal of nodal metastases is unclear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second SEER-based series of 573 patients with well-differentiated appendiceal NETs reported to the registry between 1988 and 2013 reported a 31 percent probability of nodal metastases in tumors 1.1 to 2 cm and a 64 percent probability in tumors &gt;2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The analysis also indicated the prognostic importance of the number of nodes evaluated; among those with tumors &gt;1 cm, five-year overall survival rates were worse when 12 or fewer lymph nodes were identified (five-year survival 88 versus 96 percent).</p><p/><p>A nomogram has been developed to predict the risk of nodal metastases based on tumor size and depth of invasion; however, there is no agreement as to what level of risk would warrant a right hemicolectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Thus, there is limited evidence on which to base clear indications for right hemicolectomy in patients with a diagnosis of appendiceal NET. Consensus-based guidelines from the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS) and European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) suggest completion hemicolectomy for all tumors &gt;2 cm and for smaller tumors between 1 and 2 cm in the presence of deep mesoappendiceal invasion, positive or unclear margins, higher proliferative rate (grade 2), angioinvasion, and mixed histology [goblet cell carcinoid, adenocarcinoid] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. We agree with these guidelines and pursue complete right colectomy for all tumors &gt;2 cm and for those tumors &lt;2 cm if there is evidence of mesoappendiceal or vascular invasion, positive or uncertain margins, and mixed histology. However, others disagree and consider appendectomy alone to be adequate for tumors &lt;2 cm, even with mesoappendiceal invasion or other adverse histologic features.</p><p>For NETs between 1.0 and 1.9 cm in the absence of mesoappendiceal invasion and for tumors less than 1 cm in size, there is general agreement that simple appendectomy alone is adequate. Prior to the procedure, a full colonoscopy should be undertaken to rule out a synchronous colon cancer.</p><p>The surgeon should also perform a complete inspection of the bowel since up to 25 percent of midgut NETs (small bowel, proximal colon) may be multifocal and sometimes associated with malignant gastrointestinal tumors of other histologic types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Posttreatment follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trial data or evidence-based guidelines for follow-up after resection of a gastrointestinal NET at any site.

The 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) classification recognizes three main categories of mucinous neoplasms: mucinous adenoma, low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN, also called appendiceal neoplasms of uncertain malignant potential), and appendiceal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Most schemes attempt to classify the tumors as either benign or malignant according to their clinical behavior, but there is some overlap. As an example, mucoceles that develop from adenomas can be completely eradicated with complete excision. But &quot;benign&quot; adenomas that perforate can recur as disseminated peritoneal mucinous tumors. The term pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is typically applied to this clinical scenario. PMP is discussed in more detail below.

The term PMP was originally applied to intraperitoneal mucinous spread originating from a cystadenoma of the appendix. As the tumor grows and occludes the lumen, mucus accumulates, and the appendix ruptures. The peritoneum is then seeded with mucus-producing cells, which continue to proliferate and produce mucus. The progressive accumulation of copious amounts of mucinous fluid gradually fills the peritoneal cavity, resulting in the characteristic &quot;jelly belly&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Inevitably, this condition progresses to intestinal obstruction, which is fatal without treatment.</p><p>Over the years, the term PMP began to be used more generally by some authors and clinicians to signify not only intraperitoneal mucinous dissemination from rupture of a benign cystadenoma, but also peritoneal dissemination of mucus-producing invasive adenocarcinomas of the appendix, large and small bowel, lung, breast, pancreas, stomach, bile ducts, gallbladder, and fallopian <span class=\"nowrap\">tubes/ovary</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>However, the term PMP should be limited to &quot;a pathologically and prognostically homogeneous group of cases characterized by histologically benign peritoneal tumors that are frequently associated with an appendiceal mucinous adenoma&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

Although some consider that disseminated mucin-producing adenocarcinomas of the appendix (referred to as peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis) fall into the category of PMP, this variant is an aggressive subset of peritoneal mucinous tumors that does not behave similarly to the more indolent DPAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

On computed tomography (CT) scan, the mucinous material is similar in density to water and appears heterogeneous.

A striking early finding is the characteristic peripheral location of tumor within the abdomen and pelvis, and relative sparing and central displacement of the small bowel and mesentery (termed the &quot;redistribution phenomenon&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/28,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,36</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that the presence of tumor implants &gt;5 cm on the jejunum, proximal ileum, or adjacent mesentery is more consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma with secondary peritoneal carcinomatosis than DPAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/28,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,36</a>]. The presence of segmental obstruction of the small bowel also raises suspicion for peritoneal adenocarcinomatosis, and both findings predict a less favorable outcome from aggressive cytoreduction and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC; see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Whether any of these additional treatments prolongs survival is unclear because randomized clinical trials have not been performed, and agreement on definitions of clinical subsets is lacking. Retrospective data from small groups of patients treated at three different centers using a combination of these approaches demonstrate that a reasonable percentage of patients live five years (probably reflecting the indolent natural history of this condition), but survival is clearly diminished at ten years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72427 \">table 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/30,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,38,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Aggressive cytoreduction and intraperitoneal chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A more aggressive approach that includes radical surgical removal of all intraabdominal and pelvic disease and the administration of intraperitoneal heated chemotherapy has been adopted by some clinicians aiming for cure. In view of the rarity of extraperitoneal spread in patients with PMP or DPAM, it would seem intuitive that intraperitoneal chemotherapy (which can permit a several-fold increase in drug concentration in the abdominal cavity compared to systemic administration) might control growth of peritoneal disease. However, despite this regional advantage, penetration into tumor tissue is limited to a maximum of 1 to 2 mm from the surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>].</p><p>Drug penetration may be enhanced by heating the perfusate containing chemotherapy, an approach termed HIPEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/28,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,42</a>]. This approach is best suited to patients with minimal residual disease (deposits smaller than 2 to 2.5 mm) after surgical cytoreduction.

Several retrospective series that are uncontrolled for stage suggest that survival is better with colectomy as compared to simple appendectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/2,81-84,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,81-84,89</a>].</p><p>Nonetheless, given the low likelihood of nodal metastases, some authors advocate a simple appendectomy for adenocarcinomas that are confined to the mucosa or well-differentiated lesions that invade no deeper than the submucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>], and hemicolectomy for more deeply invasive tumors. Although this distinction can be difficult to make intraoperatively, a more common scenario is the unexpected finding of an adenocarcinoma when the surgical report of an appendectomy specimen is finalized. In such cases, a right colectomy need not be pursued for appendiceal adenocarcinomas that are confined to the mucosa or well-differentiated lesions that invade no deeper than the submucosa. Whether there is a survival benefit for right colectomy (versus simple appendectomy) in the setting of regionally advanced (ie, metastatic to nodes or locally to peritoneum) adenocarcinoma, particularly for mucinous adenocarcinomas, is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/86,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,91</a>]. Practice is variable. </p><p>Routine oophorectomy has been proposed at the time of colectomy because the ovaries are a common organ for metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/83,84,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84,89</a>]. Resection of ovaries that are involved with metastatic spread is clearly beneficial. As an example, in the Mayo series described above, women who underwent resection of ovarian metastases had a 31 percent five-year survival rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, no series has shown an improvement in survival with prophylactic oophorectomy, and this approach is not recommended.</p><p>The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for adenocarcinoma of the appendix is unknown. The rarity of this disease has precluded the performance of randomized studies, and few institutions see sufficient numbers of patients to report series of homogeneously treated patients. Despite the lack of available data, many medical oncologists extrapolate from data showing the efficacy of adjuvant FU-based chemotherapy for node-positive colon cancer, particularly for patients with intestinal type adenocarcinoma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer&quot;</a>). However, specific benefit from this approach is unproven, and there are no published recommendations from expert groups.</p><p>The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy is also uncertain; as with chemotherapy, randomized trials have not been conducted. One small retrospective study suggested that postoperative external beam radiotherapy improves local control and survival for patients with locally advanced but nonmetastatic disease (14 of 15 had clinical bowel perforation and seven [47 percent] had microscopic residual disease after surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

This rationale is the same as applied to the treatment of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pseudomyxoma peritonei'</a> above.)</p><p>However, in contrast to PMP, aggressive cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC are less likely to produce lasting benefit for mucinous peritoneal carcinomatosis, and patient selection is critical. Rapid recurrence of the peritoneal surface disease, combined with progression of nodal or extraperitoneal systemic disease, interferes with long-term benefit. This approach is best suited to asymptomatic patients with small volume peritoneal carcinomatosis who are likely to be successfully cytoreduced (leaving behind deposits &lt;2.5 mm) with surgical debulking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>As noted above, Sugarbaker's group uses four clinicopathologic assessments to select patients with peritoneal surface malignancy who are most likely to benefit from combined treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In general, noninvasive malignancies such as PMP or cystic mesothelioma are much more likely to undergo successful debulking and less likely than invasive adenocarcinomas to have spread to regional nodes, liver or other systemic sites.</p><p>Although CT scans can sometimes not distinguish diffuse peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM) from mucinous peritoneal carcinomatosis, the presence of tumor implants &gt;5 cm on the jejunum, proximal ileum, or adjacent mesentery is more consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma with secondary peritoneal carcinomatosis than DPAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/28,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,36</a>]. In addition, the presence of segmental obstruction of the small bowel also raises suspicion for peritoneal adenocarcinomatosis, and both findings predict a less favorable outcome from aggressive cytoreduction and heated intraperitoneal heated chemotherapy (HIPEC, see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pseudomyxoma peritonei'</a> above.).</p><p>Aggressive cytoreduction and HIPEC has been tried for secondary peritoneal carcinomatosis in several centers throughout the world, although only one prospective controlled trial has been completed. This Dutch trial randomly assigned 105 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from appendiceal (n = 18) or colorectal (n = 87) cancer without evidence of other metastases to surgical debulking (aiming to achieve deposits &le;2.5 mm) with HIPEC versus systemic chemotherapy without debulking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Only palliative surgery was permitted in the control patients, and they received FU and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> given weekly until progression. In the experimental group, after debulking, the abdominal cavity was perfused for 90 minutes with isotonic dialysis fluid containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> and heated to 41 degrees C. After HIPEC, anastomoses were completed and the abdomen closed. Systemic chemotherapy similar to the control arm was started six weeks after cytoreduction and HIPEC.</p><p>After a median follow-up of 22 months, median survival (the major endpoint) was significantly longer in the HIPEC group (22.4 versus 12.6 months, p = 0.032). The study has been criticized because the experimental group differed from controls not only in the use of HIPEC, but also in surgical debulking.

D. Anderson included 54 patients with a mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, or PMP, each originating from the appendix, who received at least two courses of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Several different regimens were used, although the majority (84 percent) received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> or FU with or without a platinum drug. Clinical benefit was achieved in 30 patients (55 percent), with a median progression-free survival duration of 7.6 months. There were two complete responses, 11 partial responses (objective response rate 24 percent), and 17 cases of prolonged stable disease (32 percent). The median overall survival was 55 months, reflective of the predominance of well-differentiated tumors in this cohort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefit for combination chemotherapy was also shown in a retrospective analysis of 78 patients with metastatic poorly differentiated or signet ring appendiceal adenocarcinoma who were treated with a variety of regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

Eligible patients had unresectable DPAM (n = 27) or peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis without (n = 3) or with (n = 10) intermediate or discordant features; those with bowel obstruction or any condition that might affect the oral absorption of capecitabine were excluded. At the time of enrollment, 23 patients (58 percent) had progressing disease while 17 (42 percent) had a stable pattern of tumor growth. Treatment consisted of capecitabine (1250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/<sup>m2</sup></span> twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 21 days) and mitomycin (7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/<sup>m2</sup></span> on day 1 every six weeks).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After six months, three of the 23 patients whose disease was progressive at baseline had a sustained reduction in the volume of mucus, one of whom also had a reduction in the solid component of the disease; nine others (41 percent) had stabilization of tumor growth. Of the 17 patients with stable disease prior to trial entry, three had a reduction in the volume of mucus which was maintained at three and six months; nine others had persisting stable disease, and five progressed. Two patients with initially unresectable disease were able to undergo potentially curative surgical cytoreduction after chemotherapy. Thus, of 39 assessable patients, 15 (38 percent) appeared to benefit from treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Overall, therapy was reasonable well tolerated. Only 6 percent of cycles were complicated by grade 3 or 4 toxicity (all hand-foot syndrome), and cumulative hematologic toxicity related to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> was not observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As previously noted, a durable response has been reported using an oxaliplatin-based regimen in a patient with advanced goblet cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoid). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Goblet cell carcinomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>One problem is accurate response assessment, as illustrated by a prospective study of 34 consecutive patients with mucinous peritoneal carcinomatosis who received neoadjuvant treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> plus short-term infusional FU and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (FOLFOX, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50132 \">table 14</a>)) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> plus oxaliplatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. By radiographic (CT) assessment, 22 patients (65 percent) were thought to have stable disease, seven (20 percent) to have progression, and five (15 percent), a partial response. However, intraoperative findings were consistent with progressive disease in 50 percent of cases, and 29 percent of patients had histologic evidence to support some response to therapy.</p><p>There is no clear evidence supporting the superiority of any particular chemotherapy regimen in patients with appendiceal adenocarcinoma or PMP. Given the greater antitumor efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> and irinotecan-based regimens compared to FU alone (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>) in patients with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, trials utilizing these regimens for appendiceal adenocarcinoma are urgently needed.

For example, in the case of colorectal cancer, CEA is useful for prognostication at the time of initial diagnosis, and for posttreatment surveillance as a means of detecting disease recurrence in those who have undergone potentially curative resection. In addition, when levels of serum tumor markers are elevated, serial assay is useful for monitoring response to therapy. In general, tumor markers are NOT useful diagnostically.

However, the available data suggest that tumor markers (most commonly CEA, CA 19-9, and CA-125) are elevated in the majority of patients with advanced appendiceal mucinous tumors and adenocarcinomas, and that, in this setting, levels correlate with treatment outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/109-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">109-113</a>]. </p><p>If initially elevated, tumor markers such as CEA, CA 19-9, or CA-125 may be useful in the posttreatment follow-up of patients with advanced disease; in one report, elevations in tumor markers predated radiographic evidence of disease recurrence by up to nine months following cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. </p><p>There are no definitive data for use of tumor markers in surveillance after curative intent surgery for appendiceal adenocarcinomas; however, extrapolation of data from colorectal cancer is reasonable to apply in this setting.

The main histologic types are carcinoids, adenocarcinomas, adenocarcinoids, cystadenomas, and cystadenocarcinomas. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For appendiceal well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), there is limited evidence on which to base clear indications for right hemicolectomy. However, we suggest reoperation and right colectomy for tumors larger than 2 cm and for tumors 1 to 1.9 cm with mesoappendiceal or vascular invasion, positive or uncertain margins, or mixed histology (eg, adenocarcinoid) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Most patients have localized disease, and the prognosis is excellent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Simple appendectomy alone is sufficient for tumors &lt;1.0 cm in the absence of mesoappendiceal invasion and for tumors 1 to 1.9 cm that lack mesoappendiceal invasion and other adverse histologic features. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Neuroendocrine tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Following treatment, we follow the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for posttreatment surveillance (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment follow-up'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For appendiceal NETs &le;2 cm confined to the appendix and treated by simple appendectomy, no follow-up is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For larger or node-positive tumors treated by right hemicolectomy, between 3 and 12 months postresection, we perform a history and physical examination, obtain chromogranin testing, and consider computed tomography (CT) imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beyond one year postresection, we perform a history and physical examination every 6 to 12 months along with chromogranin testing and consideration of radiographic imaging studies annually. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spectrum of epithelial tumors of the appendix ranges from the benign mucocele to an aggressive adenocarcinoma. Simple appendectomy, taking care not to rupture the tumor intraoperatively, is sufficient therapy for benign appendiceal mucoceles, cystadenomas, and some cystadenocarcinomas. A right colectomy is indicated for cystadenocarcinomas with mesenteric or adjacent organ involvement, complicated mucoceles with involvement of the terminal ileum or cecum, cystadenocarcinomas, and for goblet cell carcinoids. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Appendiceal mucoceles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=appendiceal-mucoceles#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Appendiceal mucoceles&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a unique condition characterized by diffuse collections of gelatinous material in the abdomen and pelvis, and associated with mucinous implants on the peritoneal surfaces. In our view, this term should be reserved for the clinical situation in which a ruptured cystadenoma seeds the peritoneal cavity with mucus-producing epithelial cells, termed diffuse peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM). The natural history is one of indolent but progressive growth, and if left untreated, this is a fatal condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A standard treatment for PMP is repeated surgical debulking for symptomatic disease. This treatment is not curative but aims to limit the buildup of mucus and its pressure effect. A more aggressive approach using radical surgical cytoreduction of all intraabdominal and pelvic disease, and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been adopted by some clinicians aiming for cure. At centers with expertise in this procedure, cytoreductive surgery followed by HIPEC is an alternative to periodic debulking without HIPEC for suitable patients with symptomatic disease. The importance of surgical technique and surgeon experience to the success and safety of this approach cannot be overemphasized. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pseudomyxoma peritonei'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to other appendiceal tumors, adenocarcinomas more often present with a clinical picture of acute appendicitis. We consider that standard treatment is a right colectomy unless the tumor is confined to the mucosa or a well-differentiated lesion that invades no deeper than the submucosa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for adenocarcinoma of the appendix is unknown. Despite the lack of available data, we suggest adjuvant FU-based chemotherapy for patients with node-positive intestinal type adenocarcinoma, extrapolating from data on adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive colon cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Adenocarcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal treatment of patients with intraperitoneal dissemination of appendiceal adenocarcinoma (mucinous peritoneal carcinomatosis as distinguished from DPAM) is unclear. Selected patients treated with aggressive surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC may do well long-term, but patient selection and the experience of the treating team are critical. In uncontrolled series from experienced institutions, long-term survival rates in highly selected patients range from 28 to 72 percent at 3 to 10 years. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefit of systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease is unknown. Although mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinomas have been thought to be relatively chemotherapy-refractory, case reports suggest some level of benefit for therapy in individual patients.
