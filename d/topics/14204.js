This classification was based in part upon the observation that patients with type 2 diabetes without a prior MI (mean age 58) were at the same risk for MI (20 and 19 percent, respectively) and coronary mortality (15 versus 16 percent) as patients without diabetes who had a prior MI (mean age 56) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In the Framingham Heart Study, the presence of diabetes doubled the age-adjusted risk for cardiovascular disease in men and tripled it in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Diabetes remained a major independent cardiovascular risk factor even when adjusting for advancing age, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and left ventricular hypertrophy.</p><p>Similar observations were noted in MRFIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among 5163 men who reported taking medications for diabetes (mostly type 2), 9.7 percent died from cardiovascular disease over a 12 year period; the comparable cardiovascular death rate in the 342,815 men not taking medications for diabetes was 2.6 percent. This difference was independent of age, ethnic group, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and tobacco use. However, among diabetic men, the increase in cardiovascular risk rose more steeply than in nondiabetics with the addition of each of these risk factors.</p><p>The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration group performed a meta-analysis of 102 studies that included 530,083 patients with no history of MI, angina, or stroke at the initial study visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After adjusting for other risk factors, patients with diabetes had an overall risk of CHD twice that of patients without diabetes (HR 2.0, 95%CI 1.8-2.2), with a similarly higher risk of cardiac death (HR 2.3, 95% CI 2.1-2.6) and non-fatal MI (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6-2.0). </p><p>Although most patients in the above studies had type 2 diabetes, the relative risk for cardiovascular disease compared to nondiabetics of similar age is even greater in those with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This was illustrated in a review of 292 patients with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After age 30, CHD mortality increased rapidly, particularly in patients with renal disease. The cumulative CHD mortality was 35 percent by age 55, compared to 8 and 4 percent in nondiabetic men and women, respectively, in the Framingham Heart Study. Similar relationships were noted for nonfatal MI and angina.</p><p>The age at which an individual transitions to a high risk for cardiovascular disease category is another way to demonstrate the powerful risk imparted by the presence of diabetes mellitus. This relationship was evaluated in a retrospective, population-based cohort of Canadians using a large provincial health claims database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The transition to a high-risk category (10 year event rate risk of greater than 20 percent) occurred at a younger age for men and women with type 2 diabetes than for nondiabetic patients (mean difference 15 years). Using a broad definition of cardiovascular disease, the age of onset of high-risk was 41 and 48 years for men and women with diabetes, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Extent of coronary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-18</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] studies have found that the extent of the disease in the coronary arteries is greater among diabetic patients. As an example, the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trial provided coronary angiographic data obtained during an acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. TAMI included 148 diabetic and 923 nondiabetic patients in whom cardiac catheterization was performed at 90 minutes and seven to ten days after thrombolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Compared to the nondiabetics, the diabetic patients had a significantly higher incidence of multivessel disease (66 versus 46 percent) and a greater number of diseased vessels.</p><p>Multivessel CHD is also common in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly those with two or more coronary risk factors other than diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There also may be an association between the extent of coronary disease and the degree of glycemic control. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Silent ischemia and infarction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Temporal trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of cardiovascular disease has declined substantially in adults with and without diabetes over the last 50 years. The magnitude of this effect and the persistence of greater risk in diabetic patients were illustrated in a report from the Framingham Heart Study of participants seen between 1950 and 1966 and between 1977 and 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The age and sex-adjusted rate of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, CHD death, or stroke) decline from 287 to 147 per 10,000 person years in participants with diabetes (a 49 percent decline) and from 85 to 54 cardiovascular events in those without diabetes (a 35 percent decline). Diabetes was still associated with a two-fold increase in risk (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.44-2.66). The reductions in risk were similar in men and women.</p><p>However, different findings were noted in a report from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which evaluated the time periods of 1971 to 1975 and 1982 to 1984 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There was smaller decline in cardiovascular mortality over time in diabetic men (13 versus 36 percent in nondiabetic men), while the risk by 23 percent in diabetic women (compared to a 27 percent decline in risk in nondiabetic women). A possible explanation for the difference in findings is that the Framingham Heart Study compared outcomes over a much longer period, beginning in the 1950s and ending in the 1990s. In addition, the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed in the Framingham report compared to a patient-reported clinician diagnosis in NHANES.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocardial infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). In the worldwide INTERHEART study of patients from 52 countries, diabetes accounted for 10 percent of the population-attributable risk of a first MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Type 2 diabetics without a prior infarction were at the same risk for MI (20 and 19 percent, respectively) and coronary mortality (15 versus 16 percent) as nondiabetics with a prior MI. The risk of infarction was greatest in diabetics with a prior MI and lowest in nondiabetics without a prior MI (45 and 4 percent, respectively). These findings were independent of other risk factors such as total cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking.</p><p>Similar findings have been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], including a much larger series of 13,790 patients in a population-based cohort from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At nine years of follow-up, there were 634 cardiac deaths or nonfatal MIs (4.6 percent). Event rates varied among patients with or without diabetes and with or without a history of MI as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No diabetes and no MI &ndash; 3.9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes and no MI &ndash; 10.8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No diabetes and prior MI &ndash; 18.9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes and prior MI &ndash; 32.2 percent</p><p/><p>These relationships may vary with gender. In another report from Finland, prior MI was a greater risk factor for CHD mortality than diabetes without a prior MI in men (hazard ratio 1.78), but diabetes without a prior MI was a greater risk factor in women (hazard ratio 1.75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Possible contributory factors are that diabetic patients are more likely to have multivessel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and fewer coronary collateral vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic CHD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the increase in cardiovascular events, patients with type 2 diabetes also have a high rate of asymptomatic coronary disease as determined by the presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) on electron beam CT scanning and by inducible silent ischemia on stress imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These issues as well as possible screening for CHD in patients with diabetes are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to an increased rate of structural disease, patients with type 2 diabetes also have reduced myocardial flow reserve, a reflection of coronary vasodilator capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. This abnormality is inversely related to glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Silent ischemia and infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some diabetic patients have a blunted appreciation of ischemic pain, which may result in atypical anginal symptoms, silent ischemia, or even silent infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Silent myocardial ischemia: Epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Silent ischemia in diabetes is thought to be caused at least in part by autonomic denervation of the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. In support of this hypothesis is the observation that the uptake of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a norepinephrine analog, is reduced in diabetic patients with silent ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This finding is suggestive of sympathetic denervation, which has also been seen with positron emission tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>]. Furthermore, regional heterogeneity in sympathetic innervation can predispose to myocardial electrical instability that may lead to life-threatening arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic autonomic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another component of decreased perception of myocardial ischemia is that diabetic patients have a prolongation of the anginal perceptual threshold during exercise testing, ie, the time from onset of ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram to the onset of angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The longer the threshold, the greater the exercise capacity and the more severe the ischemia.</p><p>Diabetic patients also have an increased frequency of silent ST segment depression and coronary perfusion abnormalities during stress testing. Although the supportive data are presented separately, the potential magnitude of silent CHD can be illustrated by the results of the following study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rate of silent ischemia was evaluated in an observational study of 1899 asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes age &le;60 years (mean age 53) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The patients underwent stress testing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a> myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) and follow-up coronary angiography if the MCE were abnormal. The stress test was abnormal in 60 percent, 65 percent of whom had significant coronary disease on angiography.</p><p>This report also evaluated the relationship between the number of risk factors and the presence of silent ischemia. Sixty percent of patients had &ge;2 CHD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, a positive family history of premature CHD, or the presence of microalbuminuria).</p><p>The two risk groups (&ge;2 versus 0 or 1 risk factors) had equivalent rates of an abnormal stress test (60 percent) and of significant coronary disease on angiography (65 percent). However, the patients with &ge;2 risk factors had more severe coronary disease with significantly higher rates of three-vessel disease (33 versus 8 percent), diffuse disease (55 versus 18 percent), and vessel occlusion (31 versus 4 percent); they also had a lower rate of single vessel disease (29 versus 54 percent).

A second mechanism is that the stress of MI unmasks or worsens the tendency toward hyperglycemia.</p><p>The potential frequency with which this might occur was demonstrated in a prospective study of 181 patients with an acute MI and no previous diagnosis of diabetes in whom the fasting blood glucose and two-hour blood glucose after a standard load were serially measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Impaired glucose tolerance was present in 35 percent at hospital discharge and 40 percent three months later. The respective values for previously undiagnosed diabetes were 31 and 25 percent using oral glucose tolerance test criteria and 10 and 13 percent when only the fasting blood glucose was used.</p><p>The hemoglobin A1C concentration on admission was an independent predictor for abnormal glucose tolerance at three months, indicating that the metabolic abnormality preceded the infarction and that the hyperglycemia could not be entirely attributed to stress.</p><p>These findings strongly suggest that the fasting plasma glucose concentration and hemoglobin A1c should be measured during hospitalization in nondiabetic patients with an acute MI and that elevated values be repeated after discharge to identify those at increased risk. Whether an oral glucose test should be part of the standard evaluation remains uncertain.</p><p>An increase in risk before the diagnosis of diabetes was also noted in a report from the Nurses' Health Study in which approximately 5 percent of over 115,000 initially nondiabetic women developed type 2 diabetes at 20 year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

In one study of 42 patients with stable coronary artery disease, the fasting blood glucose was an independent predictor of platelet-dependent thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].
