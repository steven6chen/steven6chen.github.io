Clinicians often attribute the bleeding to a uterine source, but it may arise from disease at any anatomic site in the lower genital tract (vulva, vagina, cervix) or upper genital tract (uterine corpus, fallopian tubes, ovaries). The source of bleeding may also be a nongynecologic site, such as the urethra, bladder, anus, or other bowel site. The differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding is listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74527 \">table 1</a>), and varies by age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61684 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>An overview of the differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women will be reviewed here.

This may be due to a rapid decrease in estradiol after the luteinizing hormone surge and in the context of the low levels of progesterone at the point in the cycle. A less likely explanation is bleeding from a corpus luteum or hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4187966\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of disorders related to pregnancy can cause bleeding. All reproductive-age women with abnormal vaginal bleeding should have a pregnancy test as part of their initial evaluation.

In women with ectopic pregnancy, vaginal bleeding is often present in the absence of sonographic evidence of hemoperitoneum; the presumptive source of this bleeding is sloughing of the decidualized endometrium due to a failed pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4187313\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural abnormalities of the uterus are a common etiology of AUB. This was illustrated in a study of 370 women aged 22 to 82 years with AUB that did not respond to treatment with progestin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Hysteroscopy revealed an abnormal uterine cavity in two-thirds of these women: endometrial hyperplasia (23 percent), polyps (22 percent), submucous myomata (11 percent), intracavitary synechiae (6 percent), endometrial atrophy (2 percent), and adenocarcinoma (1 percent). </p><p>When anatomic abnormalities are the cause of abnormal bleeding, cyclic menses typically occur. However, the duration and flow of the menstrual period may be altered or there may be bleeding between menstrual periods (both may occur in the same patient). Anatomic abnormalities can often be diagnosed by imaging studies, but excision is sometimes required for confirmation of the diagnosis and treatment.

These benign tumors are clinically recognized in up to 25 percent of reproductive-age women. They are only occasionally found in adolescents.

In addition, fibroids are found infrequently in the cervix or broad ligament. </p><p>Intramural and submucosal fibroids distort the endometrial cavity, resulting in heavy or prolonged menstrual periods. Intermenstrual bleeding can also occur, but this is less likely and other lesions of the cervix or uterus must be considered. The uterus often feels enlarged and asymmetric on bimanual pelvic examination.

The prevalence of endometrial polyps increases with age. They are rare among adolescents, and more commonly diagnosed in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women. Clinically-recognized endometrial polyps occur in approximately 6 percent of reproductive-age women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intermenstrual bleeding is the most frequent symptom, occurring in about one-half of symptomatic cases. Bleeding after straining or heavy lifting is common. Less frequent symptoms include heavy or prolonged bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding, prolapse through the cervical os, and unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding during hormonal therapy. Polyps can be stimulated by estrogen therapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>. The uterus is typically normal on bimanual examination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4187331\"><span class=\"h3\">Adenomyosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenomyosis is a disorder in which endometrial glands and stroma are present within the uterine myometrium, the muscular layer. This condition is estimated to affect 20 percent of women. This condition appears to be more common in parous than in nulliparous women. Adenomyosis is often present in women with uterine leiomyomas or endometriosis. </p><p>The ectopic endometrial tissue appears to induce hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the surrounding myometrium, which results in a diffusely enlarged uterus and heavy, prolonged, painful menstrual periods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-adenomyosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine adenomyosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4187337\"><span class=\"h3\">Cesarean scar defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, AUB is caused by a cesarean scar defect at the site of the hysterotomy performed during cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. In such cases, the presentation is postmenstrual spotting. This may reflect the retention of menstrual blood in the defect (sometimes referred to as niche) that is intermittently expelled after the majority of menstruation is completed. Poor contractility of the myometrium in the area of the hysterotomy site may also contribute to postmenstrual spotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3057969\"><span class=\"h3\">Arteriovenous malformation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the uterus (also referred to as enhance myometrial vascularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]) is a rare cause of AUB, but it can result in severe hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This lesion has been variably described as a cirsoid aneurysm, arteriovenous aneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, and cavernous hemangioma. </p><p>The incidence of uterine AVMs is unknown. In a systematic review of 85 cases, the mean age was 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The majority of women were premenopausal, but AVM also occurred in postmenopausal women (96 versus 4 percent). </p><p>Approximately one-half of AVMs are congenital and present with sudden uterine bleeding without any prior history of surgical instrumentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54928\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54928 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Congenital AVMs are thought to develop from a failure of embryologic differentiation leading to abnormal vascular connections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other AVMs are acquired after uterine surgery (eg, dilation and curettage, cesarean delivery, or myomectomy) or associated with neoplastic disorders including gestational trophoblastic disease or endometrial adenocarcinoma, or maternal diethylstilbestrol exposure.</p><p>A uterine AVM typically presents with uterine bleeding that is refractory to hormonal treatment. An AVM should be suspected when an invasive procedure (eg, endometrial biopsy, curettage) for unexplained uterine bleeding exacerbates the bleeding, particularly in a patient with a history of intrauterine <span class=\"nowrap\">instrumentation/surgery</span> or disorders associated with AVM. In the systematic review described above, the mean time interval from previous dilation and curettage to onset of hemorrhage was 436 days (range 1 to 6570 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The bleeding presumably occurs when the vessels erode through or abut the endometrium. The volume of bleeding can vary, but severe bleeding with hypotension, and anemia may occur.</p><p>If an AVM is suspected, imaging studies should be performed prior to uterine instrumentation (eg, curettage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Pelvic ultrasound with Doppler is typically the first-line imaging study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/17,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23,24</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with angiography may also be performed. Consultation with a radiologist to choose the appropriate imaging modality is suggested.</p><p>Initial treatment consists of hemodynamic stabilization with intrauterine tamponade (eg, with a bulb or packing material). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Managing an episode of severe or prolonged uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Uterine artery embolization is the most common treatment and appears to be effective with few complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76350%7EOBGYN%2F55273%7EOBGYN%2F69077%7EOBGYN%2F76792%7EOBGYN%2F57864\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76350 graphicRef55273 graphicRef69077 graphicRef76792 graphicRef57864 \">image 2A-E</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/22,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25-27</a>]. Restoration of normal menstrual cycles and successful pregnancies have been reported, but patients should be counseled that embolization may result in impaired fertility and that the safety of pregnancy after embolization is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

AUB-O is characteristically noted at the extremes of reproductive age (postmenarche and the menopausal transition). At any period during the reproductive years, women may develop AUB-O due to endocrine disorders (eg, polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS).</p><p>The pathophysiology in women with AUB-O is that sex steroids are produced, but not cyclically. During phases of anovulation, chronic estrogen production unopposed by adequate progesterone production allows continued proliferation of the endometrium. Eventually the thickened endometrium outgrows its blood supply and undergoes focal necrosis with partial shedding. Since shedding is not uniform and progesterone and prostaglandin-related changes have not occurred, bleeding is usually irregular, and can be prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heavy. In women with oligo-ovulation, some episodes of bleeding represent partial endometrial shedding and others are normal (post-ovulatory) menses, but it is often difficult to interpret in which phase the patient is. </p><p>In contrast, uterine bleeding in women with consistently ovulatory cycles is typically regular with a consistent cycle length and associated with molimina. Gonadotropin and sex steroid levels are normal and are secreted in a typical menstrual pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62189 \">figure 3</a>).

Clinicians often attribute the bleeding to a uterine source, but it may arise from disease at any anatomic site in the lower genital tract (vulva, vagina, cervix) or upper genital tract (uterine corpus, fallopian tubes, ovaries). The source of bleeding may also be a nongynecologic site, such as the urethra, bladder, or anus or other bowel site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74527 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61684 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the ovary usually collects intraperitoneally, rather than presenting as vaginal bleeding, but this may occur if blood passes through the fallopian tube and continues to the lower genital tract. Etiologies of ovarian bleeding include benign neoplasms and ovarian cancer. (See <a href=\"#H22897533\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fallopian tube bleeding may rarely present as vaginal bleeding. Etiologies of fallopian tube bleeding include ectopic pregnancy and salpingitis, typically as part of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). (See <a href=\"#H22897540\" class=\"local\">'Fallopian tubal bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterus is the most likely source of genital tract bleeding. The etiology of uterine bleeding depends upon the reproductive status of the patient (premenarchal, reproductive-age, postmenopausal) and the pattern of bleeding (cyclic or noncyclic). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Uterine bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine bleeding is a common symptom of a variety of disorders related to pregnancy. Other common causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) include structural abnormalities (eg, fibroids, adenomyosis), ovulatory dysfunction, and side effects of contraceptives. AUB is the cardinal symptom of endometrial cancer. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Uterine bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of cervical, vaginal, and vulvar bleeding include trauma, infection, neoplasia, and genital manifestations of systemic disease.
