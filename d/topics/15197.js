Among patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS), which includes non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA), risk stratification begins soon after presentation to detect patients at high risk during the early hospital phase. Subsequent risk stratification is aimed at predicting which patients are at increased risk after discharge.</p><p>The individual risk factors that influence prognosis will be discussed here. The use of these risk factors in risk prediction models and the prognosis of patients after myocardial infarction (MI) are discussed separately.

Over 85 percent of patients had at least one CHD risk factor.

At 26 months of follow-up, those with claudication were five times more likely to have a fatal cardiac event than those without claudication (19.2 versus 3.6 percent). When comorbidities were taken into account, patients with claudication had a significantly higher incidence of cardiac death (hazard ratio 6.57). A similar increase in risk and in underlying comorbidities in patients with peripheral artery disease has been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H357614867\"><span class=\"h2\">COPD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease are not infrequently present in the same patient.
