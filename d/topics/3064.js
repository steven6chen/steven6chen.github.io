These solutes are primarily sodium salts in the extracellular space. As a result, serum or serum sodium is used as a surrogate for assessing tonicity of the extracellular fluid.</p><p>The vast majority of patients with hyponatremia have hypotonicity, but there are exceptions. Hyponatremia without hypotonicity can be found in patients with hyperglycemia and in patients who have accumulated exogenous effective osmoles like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, sucrose, maltose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, glycine, or radiocontrast. In patients with extreme hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia, the serum sodium concentration will be measured as low by autoanalyzers and other analytical instruments that employ a diluting step, a laboratory artifact known as &quot;pseudohyponatremia.&quot; However, the sodium concentration will be measured as normal by direct sodium-selective electrodes used by blood gas analyzers and some point-of-care devices.</p><p>The causes of hyponatremia without hypotonicity are presented in this topic. The evaluation of adults with hypotonic hyponatremia, the most common presentation of hyponatremia, is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-adults-with-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of adults with hyponatremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129289448\"><span class=\"h1\">TONICITY VERSUS OSMOLALITY IN HYPONATREMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum osmolality, which normally ranges from 275 to 295 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> is usually, but not always, low in patients with hyponatremia who need to be treated. However, the serum osmolality is <strong>not</strong> a required part of the diagnostic approach in all patients with hyponatremia; rather, it is measured in specific clinical scenarios. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-adults-with-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of adults with hyponatremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Plasma tonicity, also called the <strong>effective </strong>plasma or serum osmolality, is the physical property sensed by osmoreceptors; serum tonicity determines the transcellular distribution of water. Water can freely cross almost all cell membranes and moves from an area of lower tonicity (higher water content) to an area of higher tonicity (lower water content). Thus, hypotonicity causes cells to swell. Swelling of osmoreceptor cells should suppress antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release from the posterior pituitary and thereby cause excretion of excess water in dilute urine to restore normal serum tonicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-without-hypotonicity-including-pseudohyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Failure of normal osmoregulation leads to persistent hypotonicity that may, if it develops acutely, result in swelling of brain cells and neurologic consequences.</p><p>The main difference between tonicity and osmolality is that tonicity reflects the concentration of solutes that do not easily cross cell membranes (mostly sodium salts with a small contribution from glucose) and therefore affect the movement of water between cells and the extracellular fluid.</p><p>By contrast, osmolality also includes the osmotic contributions of urea and (if present) ethanol or other alcohols or glycols. These solutes are considered &quot;ineffective&quot; osmoles since they can equilibrate across cell membranes and therefore have little effect on water movement.</p><p>The measured osmolality should be close to the osmolality calculated from the osmotic contributions of the serum sodium concentration (SNa), glucose, and urea, which are the solutes in the extracellular fluid. Although potassium is also an effective osmole, it is usually not included in the calculated serum osmolality because it is quantitatively less important. If blood glucose (Glu) is reported in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> its osmotic contribution is calculated by dividing the concentration in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> by 18; if the urea concentration is reported as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> its osmotic concentration is calculated by dividing the BUN in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> by 2.8:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Calculated serum osmolality &#160;= &#160;(2 &#160;x &#160;SNa) + (Glu &#160;&divide; &#160;18) + (BUN &#160;&divide; &#160;2.8)</p></div></div><p>If urea and glucose concentrations are reported in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> the formula is:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Calculated serum osmolality &#160;= &#160;(2 &#160;x &#160;SNa) + Glu + BUN</p></div></div><p>When the BUN is elevated, the measured serum osmolality will exceed the tonicity. If this is not recognized, then hypertonic or isotonic hyponatremia may be suspected in azotemic patients who instead have hypotonic hyponatremia. This most commonly occurs in patients with advanced kidney disease. They may develop hyponatremia because reduced renal function impairs their ability to excrete excess water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-without-hypotonicity-including-pseudohyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although the low serum sodium concentration reduces the serum osmolality, this reduction is counterbalanced to a variable degree by azotemia, which increases the osmolality. Thus, the measured osmolality may be normal or elevated.</p><p>However, while the high urea concentrations raise the osmolality, they do not increase tonicity. In contrast to sodium and glucose, urea is an ineffective osmole since it can freely cross cell membranes and therefore does not obligate water movement out of cells. Thus, patients with hyponatremia and azotemia have a low effective serum osmolality (ie, a low tonicity). In this setting, tonicity may be calculated by subtracting the theoretical urea contribution to osmolality from measured osmolality:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Tonicity &#160;= &#160;Measured serum osmolality - (BUN &#160;&divide; &#160;2.8)</p></div></div><p>Dividing the BUN by 2.8 converts <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> of urea nitrogen into <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> of urea, which is required when calculating osmolality. If blood urea is measured in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> the formula is:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Tonicity &#160;= &#160;Measured serum osmolality - BUN</p></div></div><p>True hypotonic hyponatremia despite a normal or elevated measured serum osmolality is also common in patients with alcoholism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-without-hypotonicity-including-pseudohyponatremia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The reduction in the osmotic contribution from a low serum sodium can be offset in such patients by a high plasma ethanol level. Ethanol, like urea, is an ineffective osmole since it can freely cross cell membranes and therefore does not obligate water movement out of cells. Thus, patients with hyponatremia and alcoholism may have a low serum sodium concentration but a markedly higher measured osmolality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-without-hypotonicity-including-pseudohyponatremia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The large difference between the calculated and measured serum osmolality becomes apparent when the blood alcohol level is measured.

To answer this question, the &quot;corrected&quot; sodium concentration and the effective osmolality can be calculated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The corrected serum sodium is the concentration that would result if the glucose level were reduced to the normal range. Calculation of the &quot;corrected&quot; serum sodium can be useful to assess whether hyponatremia can be fully explained by hyperglycemia. If the corrected serum sodium is within the normal range, then the patient does not have hypotonic hyponatremia. However, if the corrected serum sodium is low, then the patient likely does have hypotonic hyponatremia. By contrast, a corrected serum sodium that is elevated above the normal range indicates that hypernatremia exists. Thus, the corrected serum sodium helps predict the expected change in serum sodium during correction of hyperglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To calculate the &quot;corrected&quot; serum sodium, we recommend the use of the following ratio: The sodium concentration will fall by approximately 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for each 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/100</span> mL (5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> increase in glucose concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-without-hypotonicity-including-pseudohyponatremia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertonic, rather than hypotonic, hyponatremia can also be identified by calculating the effective osmolality from the concentration of the measured (not the corrected) serum sodium concentration (SNa) plus the concentration of blood glucose in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (which is the concentration of blood glucose [Glu] &divide; 18 if glucose is measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>.

These solutes are primarily sodium salts in the extracellular space. As a result, serum or plasma sodium is used as a surrogate for assessing tonicity of the extracellular fluid. The vast majority of patients with hyponatremia have hypotonicity, although some hyponatremic patients are not hypotonic. (See <a href=\"#H3168353600\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main difference between tonicity and osmolality is that tonicity reflects the concentration of solutes that do not easily cross cell membranes (mostly sodium salts with a small contribution from glucose) and therefore affect the movement of water between cells and the extracellular fluid. By contrast, osmolality also includes the osmotic contributions of urea and (if present) ethanol or other alcohols or glycols. These solutes are considered &quot;ineffective&quot; osmoles since they can equilibrate across cell membranes and therefore have little effect on water movement. The measured serum osmolality can sometimes be misleading, suggesting a diagnosis of hypertonic hyponatremia or isotonic hyponatremia in a patient who instead has hypotonic hyponatremia. This most commonly occurs in patients with advanced kidney disease and in alcoholic patients. (See <a href=\"#H129289448\" class=\"local\">'Tonicity versus osmolality in hyponatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three general categories of hyponatremia without hypotonicity:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hypertonic hyponatremia caused by hyperglycemia</strong> &ndash; The increase in serum glucose raises the serum tonicity, pulling water out of cells and expanding the extracellular water space, thereby lowering the serum sodium concentration. Hyponatremia can be attributed to the hyperglycemia if the &quot;corrected&quot; serum sodium is normal (calculated by adding 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> to the serum sodium for each 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/100</span> mL [5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> increase in glucose concentration) or if the effective osmolality is at least 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (calculated by doubling the serum sodium concentration and adding concentration of glucose in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1518432142\" class=\"local\">'Hypertonic hyponatremia caused by hyperglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hypertonic or isotonic hyponatremia caused by exogenous solutes</strong> &ndash; Infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG; which is suspended in hypertonic mannitol, maltose, or sucrose) can, if kidney function is impaired, lead to retention of these sugars in the blood. This causes water to exit cells and thereby reduces the serum sodium concentration. The absorption of nonconductive glycine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, or mannitol irrigation solutions during transurethral resection of the prostate or bladder, during hysteroscopy, or during laparoscopic surgery or the infusion of histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) during open heart surgery can lower the serum sodium by increasing the extracellular fluid volume with these sodium-free solutions.

This is a <strong>laboratory artifact</strong> that is called pseudohyponatremia. Although rare, it is important to suspect pseudohyponatremia in the following clinical scenarios in order to prevent complications from aggressive treatment with isotonic or hypertonic saline (see <a href=\"#H2837564000\" class=\"local\">'Pseudohyponatremia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients who have lipemic serum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients who have obstructive jaundice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients who have a plasma cell dyscrasia</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyponatremia-without-hypotonicity-including-pseudohyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Danziger J, Zeidel ML.
