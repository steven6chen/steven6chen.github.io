Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALAD) porphyria (ADP; OMIM 612740, also called Doss porphyria and plumboporphyria) is the rarest of the inherited porphyrias, with only six documented cases reported worldwide.</p><p>ADP is an acute hepatic porphyria. It is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from severe deficiency of ALAD, the second enzyme in the pathway of heme synthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a>). The incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ADP will be reviewed here. An overview of porphyrias is presented separately.

The first two cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and the fifth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] were identified in Germany by Doss, and therefore the disease is referred to as Doss porphyria. It has also been termed plumboporphyria because ALAD is inhibited by lead, and lead poisoning can mimic the clinical and biochemical findings of ADP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46984299\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458080\"><span class=\"h2\">Enzymology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heme synthesis defects can cause accumulation of pathogenic intermediates in red blood cell precursor and hepatic cells that leak into the plasma and cause toxicity to a variety of tissues. ALA dehydratase porphyria (ADP) is caused by severe reduction in the activity of the second enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALAD, also called porphobilinogen synthase [PBGS]; EC 4.2.1.24) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a>). ALAD catalyzes the formation of the monopyrrole porphobilinogen (PBG) from two molecules of ALA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77451 \">figure 2</a>), the obligate heme precursor.</p><p>Relative to activities of other enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, ALAD is present in vast abundance in mammalian cells. In the liver, for example, the activity of ALAD is 80- to 100-fold that of ALA synthase, the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway and the rate-limiting enzyme in the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54358 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This physiologic abundance of ALAD helps to explain why heterozygotes with half-normal ALAD activity are asymptomatic.</p><p>Human ALAD is a homo-octamer with a subunit size of 36,274 daltons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The enzyme binds eight zinc atoms (Zn<sup>2+)</sup> per subunit, four of which are bound to sulfhydryl groups and are required for enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The quaternary structure of the enzyme is important for enzymatic activity. ALAD mutations can promote the formation of hexamers rather than octamers; these hexamers have reduced enzymatic activity relative to octamers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H46984311\" class=\"local\">'ALAD mutations'</a> below.)</p><p>Reduced ALAD activity produces a number of biochemical findings, including elevations of urinary ALA, urinary coproporphyrin III, and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin. (See <a href=\"#H457866566\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>However, these biochemical findings are not specific for ADP, because the activity of normal ALAD can be inhibited in the following clinical scenarios:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lead is a potent inhibitor of ALAD, and lead poisoning (plumbism) can produce the same symptoms and biochemical abnormalities as ADP, including increased urinary ALA and coproporphyrin III and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Over 80 percent of blood lead is bound to erythrocyte ALAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Individuals with heterozygous ALAD deficiency may have increases susceptibility to lead poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lead levels are normal in ADP. In contrast to lead poisoning, erythrocyte ALAD activity in individuals with ADP is not restored by the addition of zinc or dithiothreitol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is not established whether the common ALAD variant, K59N, which by itself does not reduce enzyme activity, predisposes to lead poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H46984311\" class=\"local\">'ALAD mutations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most potent inhibitor of ALAD is succinylacetone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], a structural analogue of ALA that is found in excess concentrations in the urine and blood of patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1). As a result, approximately 40 percent of children with HT1 develop the signs and symptoms of ADP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of tyrosine metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced ALAD activity has been reported in a number of other experimental and clinical conditions of uncertain significance. As examples, exposure to iron, trichloroethylene, and styrene reduces ALAD activity in rats. Erythrocyte ALAD activity is moderately decreased in humans and rats with diabetes mellitus, in patients undergoing dialysis for chronic renal failure (perhaps related to zinc deficiency), and in smokers and alcoholics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>The fact that neuropathic symptoms of ADP are the same as in other acute porphyrias suggests that ALA or its metabolites, rather than PBG, which is elevated in other acute porphyrias, may be neurotoxic. This notion is further supported by the finding that patients with hereditary tyrosinemia frequently develop clinical findings indistinguishable from ADP, including neurologic abnormalities, most likely via the marked inhibition of ALAD by succinylacetone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17</a>].

The human ALAD gene is localized to chromosome 9q34 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The ALAD gene contains two alternative noncoding exons, 1A and 1B, and 11 coding exons, 2 through 12, and two promoter regions generate housekeeping and erythroid-specific transcripts by alternate splicing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. It is believed that independent regulation of the expression of housekeeping and erythroid-specific transcripts evolved to ensure sufficient heme biosynthesis for the high-level tissue-specific production of hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The promoter region upstream of the housekeeping exon 1A is GC-rich and contains three potential Sp1 elements and a CCAAT box. Further upstream are three potential GATA-1 binding sites and an AP1 site. The promoter region upstream of the erythroid-specific exon 1B has several CACCC boxes and two potential GATA-1 binding sites. The housekeeping transcript includes exon 1A but not 1B, while the erythroid-specific transcript contains exon 1B but not 1A. Expression of an erythroid specific ALAD transcript in the bone marrow, as well as erythroid specific expression of delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), and uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS), ensure sufficient heme biosynthesis for normal production of large amounts of hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46984311\"><span class=\"h2\">ALAD mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eleven ALAD mutations have been identified in six patients with ADP to date, and thus this disease is highly heterogeneous at the molecular level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90313 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Five patients inherited a separate ALAD mutation from each parent, while the sixth was heterozygous for an ALAD mutation and developed a myeloproliferative disorder accompanied by expansion of a clone of erythroid cells that expressed only the mutant protein, such that his erythroid cells were markedly ALAD deficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The first molecular analysis of the ALAD gene defect in ADP was made in a German patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Expression studies of mutant cDNAs derived from this patient demonstrated that one ADP mutation produced an enzyme with little enzymatic activity but a normal half-life, while the other produced an enzyme with partial activity and a markedly decreased half-life. Thus, the majority of the ALAD protein in this individual's cells would be expected to be inactive. Three other patients with ADP were also found to express a form of the ALAD protein, indicating that other ALAD mutations may also produce stable proteins with decreased enzymatic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/12,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,25,26</a>].</p><p>Other types of ALAD mutations have included a two-base deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and two intronic mutations, both in intron 3. Studies of these mutations in cell-free systems have indicated that conformational effects that affect protein oligomerization are important in determining enzyme activity (eg, by causing formation of a hexameric rather than an octameric enzyme) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The Belgian male with onset of symptoms at age 63 in association with a myeloproliferative disorder was shown to have two separate genetic variations in one ALAD allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; the other allele was entirely normal. Therefore, this man was heterozygous for ALAD deficiency. His family members who had decreased ALAD activity (approximately 50 percent of normal) were also heterozygous for the same genetic changes. Heterozygous ALAD deficiency in this man was clinically &quot;silent&quot; until he developed polycythemia vera, leading to expansion of a polycythemic clone that carried only the mutant ALAD allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A causal relationship between the myeloproliferative disorder and ADP was strongly suggested by temporal relationships between the onset of his porphyric symptoms and the onset and relapses of his myeloproliferative disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Interestingly, expression of ALAD cDNAs from this individual in CHO cells revealed that only one of the changes was pathogenic: cDNAs expressing the G133R mutation alone and in combination with the K59N variant produced proteins with 8 and 16 percent ALAD activity, respectively, whereas a cDNA for the K59N variant alone produced a protein with normal ALAD activity. Subsequently, the K59N variant was found to be present in approximately 10 percent of the general population, and modeling of the K59N protein suggested that it may have normal folding, assembly, and functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/13,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,29</a>].</p><p>Another significant ALAD mutation, producing an F12L amino acid substitution, was found in an asymptomatic Swedish girl, after she was found to have markedly decreased ALAD activity (12 percent of normal) during neonatal screening for hereditary tyrosinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A cDNA expressing this mutation produced a protein that underwent premature processing, resulting in practically no enzymatic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This heterozygous mutation resulted in very low enzyme activity because it favored formation of an ALAD hexamer rather than the normally-occurring octamer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457866560\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only six reported cases of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALAD) porphyria (ADP) have been confirmed at the molecular level. Strikingly, all were male. These include four males in their teens (three in Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/1,2,32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,32-36</a>], one in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]); a Swedish male infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]; and an elderly Belgian man [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Some other cases reported as ADP based on incomplete biochemical findings have not been confirmed by DNA studies, and later negative findings were not reported. Why this condition has only occurred in males is not explained. No ethnic predominance is evident. None of the patients with genetic defects were related, and most had novel ALAD mutations. Greater awareness of porphyrias appears to account for occurrence of five of the six documented cases in Europe.</p><p>The frequency of genetic carriers for ALAD deficiency (ie, heterozygotes) in the normal population in Sweden is estimated to be approximately 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Individuals heterozygous for ALAD deficiency (eg, parents of affected individuals) have partial deficiency of ALAD (approximately 50 percent of normal activity), and are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. They might be at increased risk for illness when exposed to environmental toxins that inhibit ALAD activity (eg, lead). One patient with acute porphyria was heterozygous for a coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) mutation, as in hereditary coproporphyria, but also had a contributing heterozygous ALAD mutation that was evident from an unusual pattern of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457866566\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The full spectrum of clinical features for delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALAD) porphyria (ADP) is unknown, since so few cases have been reported. Four of the reported patients had a similar clinical presentation, with symptoms and signs that were indistinguishable from other acute porphyrias (eg, acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria). These symptoms, which include abdominal pain, predominantly motor neuropathy causing muscle weakness, and neuropsychiatric manifestations, are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Onset of symptoms in these four patients was at 14 to 15 years. At this age, all of the patients developed abdominal pain and other symptoms of acute porphyria, including motor neuropathy with significant muscle weakness. Effects on the skin and other organ systems were absent. Three of these patients were German males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and the fourth was recognized in the US, with unrelated parents from Colombia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The other two patients with ADP had clinical features that were quite different. One was a Swedish infant with severe symptoms beginning at birth and progressing to pain, vomiting, hyponatremia, polyneuropathy, and respiratory muscle motor dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/37,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40-42</a>]. The other patient, a Belgian, developed symptoms of acute porphyria at 63 years of age in association with a myeloproliferative disorder (polycythemia vera). Porphyric neuropathy gradually worsened with loss of strength in both arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/23,28,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,43,44</a>].</p><p>ADP would be expected to be exacerbated by drugs, hormones, and chemicals that precipitate attacks of the other acute porphyrias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422 \">table 3</a>). Given the paucity of reported cases, however, these associations are not established for ADP.</p><p>Biochemical findings in the six reported cases of ADP have been distinctive relative to other acute porphyrias, with the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked elevations of urinary ALA and coproporphyrin III</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked elevations of erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Little or no elevation in urinary porphobilinogen (PBG), which is found in other acute porphyrias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Little or no elevation of plasma and fecal porphyrins</p><p/><p>All six reported cases had severe deficiencies of ALAD activity, as measured in erythrocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457866590\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458899\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute porphyrias should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with neurovisceral symptoms, such as abdominal pain, neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially when initial clinical evaluation does not suggest another cause. An accurate diagnosis of acute porphyria is important in order to institute appropriate therapy and avoid progressive neurological impairment. Because the presenting symptoms and signs are nonspecific, a high index of suspicion is required.</p><p>As with other porphyrias, the preferred approach to diagnostic testing is to use a first-line test for screening, and more extensive second-line testing if the screening test is positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The initial screening test for acute porphyrias is rapid qualitative testing for urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) on a spot urine sample obtained during an acute attack. However, urinary PBG will <strong>not</strong> be significantly increased in individuals with delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) porphyria (ADP). Thus, in those with suspected acute porphyria and normal urinary PBG, urinary total porphyrins and ALA should be tested on the same urine sample (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61709\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709 \">algorithm 1</a>). Those with ADP will have a normal (or minimally elevated) urinary PBG and elevated urinary ALA and total porphyrins. Of note, urinary total porphyrins will also remain increased longer in those with hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria, in which ALA and PBG can decrease rapidly after an acute attack of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H87108300\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Initial testing should be done on a spot (single void) urine specimen rather than on a 24-hour collection because elevations are expected to be high enough to be detected on a spot sample, levels can decline as the acute attack resolves, and a 24-hour collection can unnecessarily delay diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>PBG will be normal (or minimally elevated) in ADP; thus, the same urine specimen should be saved for quantitative determination of ALA, PBG, and total porphyrins. Measuring creatinine in the spot urine sample, so results can be expressed per gram of creatinine, is essential. If the screening tests are negative, or if symptoms have resolved but suspicion of acute porphyria remains, urine testing can be repeated when symptoms recur. Because marked elevations are expected, especially during symptoms due to acute porphyrias, a 24-hour urine collection is generally not required for quantitative assessment of ALA, PBG, and total porphyrins.</p><p>Additional biochemical testing following a finding of an increase in urinary ALA includes erythrocyte total protoporphyrin (which if elevated should be fractionated to measure zinc protoporphyrin and metal-free protoporphyrin) and erythrocyte ALAD activity.</p><p>Because other conditions can inhibit erythrocyte ALAD activity, leading to increases in urinary ALA and coproporphyrinogen III and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, other causes of impaired ALAD activity must also be eliminated. (See <a href=\"#H458080\" class=\"local\">'Enzymology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H87108300\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The following testing is appropriate depending on the clinical setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood lead level, to evaluate for lead poisoning. Lead poisoning is characterized by elevated lead levels and restoration of erythrocyte ALAD activity by the addition of zinc or dithiothreitol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ala-dehydratase-porphyria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-occupational-lead-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adult occupational lead poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine organic acids, to evaluate for hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1). HT1 presents in infancy with progressive liver disease and renal tubular dysfunction; urinary organic acid testing in HT1 will reveal the presence of succinylacetone and other tyrosyl compounds.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of tyrosine metabolism&quot;, section on 'Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1'</a>.)</p><p/><p>ADP is an extremely rare disease, and the few reported cases have been heterogeneous clinically and at the molecular level. It is thus essential to evaluate new cases of ADP at the molecular level.

It is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from deficiency of ALA dehydratase (ALAD), the second enzyme in the pathway of heme synthesis, due to homozygous or (in all six cases reported to date) compound heterozygous ALAD mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H457866554\" class=\"local\">'Definition and history'</a> above and <a href=\"#H46984299\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of ADP may be similar to other acute porphyrias, but the age of presentation is variable. Four cases had onset of typical neurovisceral symptoms in the teenage years; a severely affected child had symptoms from birth; and a 63-year-old man who was heterozygous for an ALAD mutation developed ADP in association with a myeloproliferative disorder. ADP is characterized by neurovisceral symptoms and elevated urinary ALA and coproporphyrin III and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, with normal or only slightly elevated urinary porphobilinogen (PBG). ALAD activity in erythrocytes is markedly reduced. (See <a href=\"#H457866566\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with neurovisceral symptoms suggestive of acute porphyria should be screened with a spot urine sample for elevated porphobilinogen (PBG). If this is negative, urinary ALA, PBG, and total porphyrins should be measured on the same sample, and erythrocyte total porphyrins measured. (See <a href=\"#H458899\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ADP is suggested, in the presence of the above biochemical findings, by documenting ALAD deficiency in red blood cells and eliminating other potential causes of ALAD deficiency; it is confirmed by identification of compound heterozygous (or homozygous) ALAD mutations. (See <a href=\"#H458905\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major conditions in the differential diagnosis include other causes of neurovisceral symptoms, including other acute porphyrias, lead poisoning, and hereditary tyrosinemia type 1. (See <a href=\"#H87108300\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment experience with ADP is limited.
