Planned TOLAC may result in labor with vaginal birth (VBAC) or unplanned intrapartum cesarean delivery. Decision-making regarding mode of delivery must take into consideration the patient's personal preferences, obstetrical history, scientific data on risks and benefits of TOLAC versus PRCD, and availability of TOLAC in the selected birth setting. </p><p>This topic will review issues related to choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth, including calculators to predict an individual's likelihood of success. Issues related to management of labor and delivery during TOLAC and issues related to repeat cesarean delivery are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trial of labor after cesarean delivery: Intrapartum management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repeat-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repeat cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4140037907\"><span class=\"h1\">CHANGES IN UNITED STATES TOLAC RATE OVER TIME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of TOLAC among eligible women in the United States (US) has fluctuated over time. In 1980, a National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference report questioned the necessity of routine PRCD and, with endorsement from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], encouraged clinicians and patients to increase the rate of TOLAC with great success: The TOLAC rate reached a peak of 51.8 percent in 1995, with a concomitant decline in total cesarean delivery rates in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>As the TOLAC rate increased, however, so did reports of uterine rupture-related maternal and perinatal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. These adverse outcomes dampened enthusiasm for TOLAC, and the rate of TOLAC again began to decrease, reaching a nadir of 15.9 percent in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While the reasons for this dramatic decline are not completely clear, the fact that some individual practitioners and hospitals stopped offering TOLAC due to fear of catastrophic complications associated with TOLAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] and concerns about medical liability claims played a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In a 2009 Survey of Professional Liability by ACOG, 91 percent of members who responded reported at least one liability claim against them in their career, 62 percent of claims during the survey period were related to obstetric care, and 25 percent of those who made changes in their obstetric practice due to liability concerns stopped offering TOLAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In 2013, the most recent year for which the TOLAC rate in the US is available, 20 percent of women with one previous cesarean delivery and 7 percent of women with two or more cesarean deliveries attempted TOLAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. One study estimated that if all women who were good candidates for VBAC underwent TOLAC, the cesarean rate in women with a prior cesarean would be reduced from 70.4 to 25.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H489090\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES OF TOLAC VERSUS PRCD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical and obstetric benefits of successful TOLAC derive from avoidance of the potential adverse outcomes associated with cesarean delivery, especially multiple cesarean deliveries. Most maternal morbidity associated with TOLAC occurs when intrapartum cesarean delivery becomes necessary, which is associated with postoperative infectious and other morbidities (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Postoperative issues&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>). A less common but serious potential adverse outcome associated with TOLAC is uterine rupture, which can be associated with serious morbidity, particularly for the neonate in whom uterine rupture can be fatal.</p><p>Conversely, the medical and obstetric benefits of PRCD derive from avoidance of the potential adverse outcomes associated with TOLAC, primarily uterine rupture and morbidity associated with intrapartum cesarean delivery. Thus, the benefits of TOLAC are closely related to having a successful vaginal birth, which has lower morbidity than both scheduled and intrapartum cesarean delivery.</p><p>In 2010, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of Health convened a Consensus Development Conference to evaluate all available evidence related to TOLAC and make recommendations for practitioners regarding the management of women with a prior cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Their final report summarized the state of knowledge concerning the outcomes of PRCD versus TOLAC in women who have undergone one or more prior cesarean deliveries. These findings and subsequent data are described throughout this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H819465192\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of available evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No large randomized trials have been performed to provide comparative data on outcomes of TOLAC versus PRCD; a systematic review identified only two randomized trials involving a total of 320 women with minimal data on maternal and infant clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>It is important to recognize that many case-control and cohort studies have compared these two routes of delivery. Most of these studies reported maternal and neonatal outcomes based on the actual route of delivery rather than the intended route. When this type of analysis is performed, the outcomes of women who underwent cesarean delivery after an unsuccessful TOLAC were grouped along with the outcomes of women who underwent PRCD, which is a less morbid procedure and biases the findings in favor of TOLAC. The outcomes of women who planned PRCD but spontaneously labored and were delivered vaginally were grouped along with the outcomes of women who had a successful TOLAC, which also biases findings and leads to misleading conclusions about the actual risk of adverse events or outcomes associated with the decision to attempt TOLAC or PRCD. Analysis of these data is also complicated by imprecise definitions and outcome measurements as well as difficulties encountered when trying to characterize events and outcomes attributable to route of delivery.</p><p>Although data from randomized trials would be ideal, it would be difficult to recruit adequate numbers of women willing to consent to randomization to TOLAC versus PRCD. In order to overcome this issue, a propensity analysis was performed to simulate a randomized trial of TOLAC versus PRCD in women with one prior cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Propensity analyses can provide helpful insights by using statistical techniques to balance the comparison groups; however, they are not a substitute for well-designed prospective randomized trials. This propensity analysis found that the rates of endometritis, operative injury, respiratory distress syndrome, and newborn infection were lower with PRCD, whereas the rates of hysterectomy and wound complication were higher with PRCD. The authors estimated that 62 women (95% CI 40-138) would need to undergo PRCD to prevent one maternal adverse outcome from TOLAC and 43 women (95% CI 29-78) would need to undergo PRCD to prevent one neonatal adverse outcome from TOLAC. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2693170283\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following table summarizes maternal outcomes associated with VBAC and PRCD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65114\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65114 \">table 1</a>); it was derived from a 2010 systematic review of 41 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and is subject to the limitations discussed above. Selected outcomes are discussed in more detail below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uterine rupture</strong> &ndash; The incidence of uterine rupture is low (in resource-rich countries), but when it occurs, it is often associated with TOLAC and is potentially life threatening. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development consensus conference panel described uterine rupture risk in the following way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], based on data in the 2010 systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Importantly, in this document, uterine rupture was defined anatomically as partial or complete separation of the uterine wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a hypothetical group of 100,000 women of any gestational age who undergo TOLAC, there will be 468 cases of uterine rupture. Looked at in another way, approximately 1 in 200 TOLACs will lead to uterine rupture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a hypothetical group of 100,000 women of any gestational age who undergo PRCD, there will be 26 uterine ruptures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The types and frequencies of major maternal and neonatal outcomes of uterine rupture included:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Hysterectomy: 14 to 33 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Maternal death: none</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Perinatal death: 0 to 2.8 percent</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine rupture after previous cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Although the overall risk of maternal infection appears to be similar for TOLAC and PRCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], specific risks vary by clinical setting. For example, only women in labor are at risk for intrapartum chorioamnionitis. VBAC has a lower frequency of postpartum infection than PRCD, while intrapartum cesarean delivery has the highest frequency of postpartum infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intra-amniotic-infection-clinical-chorioamnionitis-or-triple-i\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intra-amniotic infection (clinical chorioamnionitis or triple I)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-endometritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum endometritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Postoperative issues&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripartum hysterectomy</strong> &ndash; Although some peripartum hysterectomies are performed because of uterine rupture during TOLAC, many others are performed because of placental attachment disorders. An increasing number of cesarean deliveries increases the risk for placenta previa and, in turn, the placenta accreta spectrum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta#H3937600\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pelvic trauma</strong> &ndash; PRCD avoids the potential risks and sequelae of pelvic trauma related to labor and vaginal birth; however, the absolute benefit compared with TOLAC is unclear and does not appear to outweigh the risks of PRCD. Pregnancy itself is the major risk factor for future pelvic relaxation disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse associated with pregnancy and childbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Convenience</strong> &ndash; For many patients, a benefit of PRCD is that scheduled delivery allows her and her family the ability to make specific work-life plans for the delivery and postpartum period. Although induction of labor can also be scheduled, TOLAC is more likely to be successful when labor is spontaneous and thus somewhat unpredictable. Personal benefits of VBAC include shorter hospital stay and quicker return to normal activities compared with PRCD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postpartum sterilization</strong> &ndash; Postpartum sterilization is readily accomplished at cesarean delivery; however, this is a minor advantage of PRCD since sterilization can be performed after a vaginal birth and often immediately following the birth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-sterilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum sterilization&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H489123\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding the short- and long-term neonatal outcomes after TOLAC versus PRCD are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and subject to the limitations discussed above. The 2010 systematic review of 41 studies discussed above reported the following neonatal outcomes relating to TOLAC and PRCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality</strong> &ndash; Perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality rates were higher with TOLAC than for PRCD (perinatal mortality rate: 0.13 versus 0.05 percent; neonatal mortality rate: 0.11 versus 0.06 percent), although the absolute risk is very low.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transient tachypnea of the newborn</strong> &ndash; Transient tachypnea of the newborn was more common with PRCD compared with TOLAC (4.2 versus 3.6 percent). However, neonatal bag and mask ventilation was used more often in infants delivered following TOLAC than in those delivered by PRCD (5.4 versus 2.5 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; Data were insufficient to determine the direction of risk for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, sepsis, trauma, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and neurologic outcomes. However, subsequent studies have observed that the rates of suspected and proven neonatal sepsis are higher for TOLAC than PRCD (suspected sepsis 5 versus 2 percent; proven sepsis 1 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and observed an increased risk of neonatal depression and NICU admission with TOLAC versus PRCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3354438206\"><span class=\"h1\">FACILITY RESOURCES FOR OFFERING TOLAC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends conducting TOLAC in facilities that are able to perform an emergency cesarean delivery in the event of a situation that is an &quot;immediate threat to the life of the woman or fetus&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. ACOG emphasized that this recommendation was not intended to restrict access to TOLAC and recognized the difficulty of providing this type of care, especially in rural settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management#H812449585\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trial of labor after cesarean delivery: Intrapartum management&quot;, section on 'Facility resources'</a>.)</p><p>When resources needed for emergency cesarean delivery are limited, ACOG recommends that practitioners discuss the available resources at the planned birth facility with women who are considering TOLAC. After this discussion, some women may consider an alternative delivery site with appropriate resources to obtain optimal outcomes, some may tolerate higher levels of risk in order to pursue TOLAC at their preferred birth facility, and some may choose PRCD. In all cases, any decision to plan for TOLAC in a setting lacking resources to perform an emergency cesarean delivery should be made only after careful consideration by the woman and her health care provider. In such instances, the discussion and plan should be documented in the obstetrical record.</p><p>Discussion of delivery options early in pregnancy can facilitate transfer of care if desired by the patient and practitioner. </p><p>We agree with ACOG that TOLAC should not be attempted as a home birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4152237431\"><span class=\"h1\">SHARED DECISION-MAKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision for a TOLAC or PRCD is made by the woman in collaboration with her provider.

Ongoing discussion throughout pregnancy is important, as conditions may arise that alter the balance of risks and benefits of the planned route of delivery. Whenever possible, the woman's preference should be honored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>In 2013, the success rate for women in the United States who attempted TOLAC after one previous cesarean delivery was 70.4 percent and was 51.4 percent for those with two or more prior cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The success rate varies among institutions and providers and is affected by antepartum, intrapartum, and nonmedical factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Factors known to affect TOLAC success rates and the individual patient's probability of success obviously need to be addressed. In a 2010 meta-analysis, the two factors that increased the odds of VBAC by at least threefold were history of VBAC and history of vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The most important factor associated with failed TOLAC (ie, intrapartum cesarean delivery) was a prior cesarean delivery for a recurring indication, such as failure to progress. Other factors that played a role, but were not as strongly associated with failed TOLAC, were increasing body mass index and older maternal age. Induction of labor significantly reduced the odds of VBAC compared with entering labor spontaneously, but a better control group would have been women who were managed expectantly. (See <a href=\"#H2051495866\" class=\"local\">'Predicting the probability of VBAC'</a> below.)</p><p>Individual patient factors that impact the risk of uterine rupture should also be discussed.

The probability of VBAC is not only important as a direct measure of outcome, but also as an indirect measure of maternal morbidity: Major maternal morbidity is lowest in women who have VBAC (morbidity 0.2 percent), higher in women who undergo PRCD (morbidity 0.8 percent), and highest in women who have a repeat cesarean delivery after a failed TOLAC (morbidity 3.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Although a TOLAC calculator or model can predict the probability of vaginal birth, which is a key concern of women contemplating TOLAC versus PRCD, a variety of other factors also influence a woman's decision regarding route of delivery.

This model was developed using multivariable logistic regression in a retrospective cohort of 1170 women.

Factors associated with increased likelihood of VBAC were diabetes, greater cervical dilation, history of vaginal birth, and history of VBAC. Factors associated with a decreased likelihood of VBAC were induction of labor, recurring indication for prior cesarean, and hypertensive disease.

Planned TOLAC may result in labor with vaginal birth (VBAC) or unplanned intrapartum cesarean delivery. Decision-making regarding mode of delivery must take into consideration the patient's personal preferences, obstetrical history, scientific data on risks and benefits of TOLAC versus PRCD, and availability of TOLAC in the selected birth setting. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medical and obstetric benefits of successful VBAC derive from avoidance of the potential adverse outcomes associated with cesarean delivery, especially multiple cesarean deliveries. Conversely, the medical and obstetric benefits of PRCD derive from avoidance of the potential adverse outcomes associated with TOLAC, primarily uterine rupture and morbidity associated with intrapartum cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"#H489090\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of TOLAC versus PRCD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision for a TOLAC or PRCD is a shared decision made by the woman in collaboration with her provider. This decision involves a combination of factors, including (see <a href=\"#H4152237431\" class=\"local\">'Shared decision-making'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Availability of TOLAC at the planned birth setting.

The body of evidence suggests a VBAC rate of 60 to 80 percent, with an estimated uterine rupture rate of 0.4 to 0.7 percent. (See <a href=\"#H15065559\" class=\"local\">'One prior low transverse uterine incision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TOLAC is inappropriate in women with standard contraindications to labor or vaginal birth (eg, placenta previa). We agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that the high risk of intrapartum uterine rupture during TOLAC favors PRCD in women with a prior transfundal uterine incision or prior uterine rupture. (See <a href=\"#H15065615\" class=\"local\">'Inappropriate candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the author's practice, women with a previous cesarean delivery and a history of vaginal birth (either prior vaginal delivery or VBAC) are encouraged to undertake a TOLAC, given that the VBAC rate has been reported to be as high as 83 percent for women with a previous vaginal delivery and 94 percent for women with a previous VBAC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients outside of this small subset of the population, the author frequently uses a VBAC calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-tolac-for-use-at-entry-to-prenatal-care\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-tolac-for-use-at-the-time-of-admission-for-delivery\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) to inform women of their individual chance of achieving a vaginal birth.
