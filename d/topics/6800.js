Some patients who are in this category before therapy are able to achieve asthma control with moderate doses of inhaled glucocorticoids and thus do not meet criteria for severe persistent asthma.

Triggers may be inhaled (eg, allergens, irritants) or ingested (eg, NSAID and beta blocker medications). A series of potential questions is given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80507 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-control-to-enhance-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger control to enhance asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occupational asthma may not be immediately apparent; patients should be asked about workplace exposures to inhaled allergens, such as laboratory animals, latex, and flour, as well as sensitizers such as glutaraldehyde, toluene diisocyanate, and trimellitic anhydride (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66185 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Definitions, epidemiology, causes, and risk factors&quot;</a>.) Some of the antigens may cause both asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

The most helpful testing includes pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry with inspiratory and expiratory flow loops, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity. Confirmation of the asthma diagnosis requires evidence of expiratory airflow limitation with a bronchodilator response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Persistent airflow limitation is seen in about 50 percent of patients with severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, air trapping, as manifest by a reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and increased residual volume and total lung capacity (on plethysmographic pulmonary function testing), is characteristic of severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In cases where there is a minimal expiratory airflow limitation, often in the face of a high degree of symptoms, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge can determine the presence of hyperreactive airways or, in conjunction with laryngoscopy, confirm paradoxical vocal fold motion. The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is typically normal or increased in asthma. However, some variants of severe asthma, including asthmatic granulomatosis, may have moderate reductions in diffusing capacity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lab/immunologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no laboratory tests that confirm or exclude asthma, but testing can help to evaluate associated conditions and asthma triggers. For patients with severe persistent asthma, a CBC and differential (to evaluate the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of eosinophils and exclude anemia as a cause of dyspnea) and a total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level (eg, for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ABPA] or for identification of candidates for anti-IgE therapy) are usually obtained. Specific testing for aspergillus sensitization (skin test or immunoassay) and an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) are performed in those with high blood eosinophils to evaluate for ABPA and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss), respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For the lifelong non-smoker with persistent and irreversible airflow obstruction, a one-time measurement of the serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level is recommended.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Tests for allergy'</a>.)</p><p>In patients from endemic areas, eosinophilia may be a manifestation of <em>Strongyloides</em> or filarial infection and can be further evaluated with specific antibody testing. In patients born in developed countries, eosinophilia is more likely to be due to adult onset (or aspirin-sensitive) asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, asthmatic granulomatosis, or rarely, EGPA. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Conditions that mimic asthma'</a> below.)</p><p>A peripheral blood eosinophil count &ge;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> may help to predict asthmatics who are at increased risk for exacerbations in the next year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In addition, the blood eosinophil count is used to identify patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who may benefit from anti-interleukin (IL)-5 therapy.

Sputum analyses must be done by a trained technician to standardize both collection and cell counting and have limited availability.

Several studies have evaluated eosinophil counts in induced sputum and on endobronchial biopsies to determine whether persistent eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation might be contributing to poor asthma control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/12,14,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,18-21</a>]. In a systematic review of six studies (374 participants with moderate to severe asthma), evaluation and treatment based on sputum eosinophils led to fewer exacerbations than management based on symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lung function (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, no difference was noted in symptoms, quality of life, or lung function.</p><p>Some patients with severe asthma have elevated sputum neutrophil counts alone or in combination with sputum eosinophilia, raising the possibility that they have an alternate asthma pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/12,19,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19,22-26</a>].

Bronchoscopy may be helpful to evaluate interstitial findings on CT scanning, for example when chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, sarcoidosis, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis are suspected.</p><p>The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE<sub>NO</sub>) has also been used to assess ongoing airway inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

If interstitial opacities are noted on the chest radiograph or if the diffusing capacity (DLCO) is reduced, a high resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the thorax should be performed to assess for interstitial lung disease and bronchiolitis. When trying to discriminate between severe asthma and bronchiolitis, the presence of a mosaic attenuation pattern makes bronchiolitis more likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

An end-inspiratory squeak may be heard on physical exam that can mimic a wheeze. The cough is typically refractory to bronchodilator therapy. HRCT of the thorax will help determine whether bronchiectasis is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis</strong> (ABPA) may develop in patients with asthma due to colonization of the airways with aspergillus and typically presents with recurrent mucoid impaction and atelectasis. The resulting immunologic reaction leads to proximal bronchiectasis. ABPA should be suspected in patients who have skin test positivity to aspergillus and elevated IgE levels (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>.

Bronchiolitis is typically a consequence of a respiratory infection, inhalational injury, organ transplantation, or connective tissue disease. Physical exam may reveal crackles and inspiratory squeaks; pulmonary function tests show progressive airflow obstruction not responsive to bronchodilator; DLCO and oxygen saturation are reduced; and chest CT scan will show interstitial opacities in a mosaic pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Inspiratory and expiratory views on HRCT may reveal patchy areas of air trapping.

Crackles are usually noted on chest exam and an HRCT reveals interstitial opacities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patchy areas of consolidation. Pulmonary function tests typically show a restrictive pattern; airflow limitation is seen uncommonly and generally only in cigarette smokers. Usually, a lung biopsy is required for diagnosis.

Exposure to allergens that typically cause HP (eg, birds, barns, humidifiers) should alert the clinician to this possibility. Pulmonary function tests may show a mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern and a reduced DLCO. Fleeting infiltrates are another clue.

Filarial and strongyloides infection should be suspected in patients from an endemic area, who have blood eosinophilia and an elevated IgE level. Specific IgG antibodies to filarial and strongyloides antigens will be positive. Improvement with specific treatment confirms the diagnosis.

Addressing these issues may reduce asthma symptoms in some patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic rhinosinusitis &ndash; Chronic rhinosinusitis is a frequent comorbid condition and is an independent risk factor for exacerbations of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
