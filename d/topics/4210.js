It is the most common infectious cause of health care-associated diarrhea and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most cases of <em>C. difficile</em> infection (CDI) in the United States are associated with inpatient or outpatient contact with a health care setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Development of CDI usually requires two events: disruption of the fecal microbiota (typically via exposure to antibiotics) and ingestion of spores via the fecal-oral route. <em>C. difficile</em> may be shed into the environment by individuals who are infected or colonized. High rates of colonization may occur among hospitalized adults, nursing home residents, and healthy infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p><em>C. difficile</em> spores can be transmitted between patients via environmental surfaces and contaminated hands of health care personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, efforts to prevent CDI must focus on two goals: reducing patient susceptibility to CDI and preventing organism transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Prevention of <em>C. difficile</em> transmission is especially challenging because the organism forms spores that can persist on environmental surfaces for months and are resistant to commonly used cleaning agents and alcohol-based hand gels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Issues related to prevention of CDI in health care and community settings are discussed here.

If the number of such rooms is limited, patients with stool incontinence should be prioritized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Gloves and gowns should be donned upon room entry and removed prior to exiting the room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>If cohorting is required, patients infected or colonized with the same organism(s) should be cohorted (ie, patients with CDI who are discordant for other multidrug-resistant organisms should not be cohorted together). In cohort rooms, gowns and gloves should be removed and hand hygiene should be performed between patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/9,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19,20</a>].</p><p>General principles regarding contact precautions are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection#H954996324\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection&quot;, section on 'Contact precautions'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal approach for discontinuation of contact precautions for CDI is uncertain. We are in agreement with guidelines regarding the duration of contact precautions for acute care settings that were published in 2018 by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These guidelines favor continuation of contact precautions for at least 48 hours after resolution of diarrhea. Continuation of contact precautions beyond resolution of diarrhea is reasonable since persistent stool shedding of <em>C. difficile</em> spores is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22</a>]. In acute care settings with elevated CDI rates despite appropriate infection prevention and control measures, continuation of contact precautions until discharge is reasonable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Hand hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to contact with a patient with CDI, health care personnel should perform hand hygiene then don gloves. Following contact with a patient with CDI, health care personnel should remove gloves then perform hand hygiene.</p><p>In routine settings, hand hygiene may be performed with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In outbreak settings, hand hygiene should be performed preferentially with soap and water before and after caring for patients with suspected or proven CDI; use of ABHR is not adequate because ABHR does <strong>not</strong> eradicate <em>C. difficile</em> spores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/9,13,23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,23-27</a>]. In addition, hand hygiene with soap and water is preferred is there is direct content with feces or an area where fecal contamination is likely (eg, the perineal region).</p><p>Hand washing with soap and water involves vigorous mechanical scrubbing and rinsing, so it is more effective than ABHR for physical removal of bacterial spores. However, hand washing with soap and water is less effective than ABHR for inactivation of vegetative (ie, non-spore-forming) bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection#H2557723252\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection&quot;, section on 'Hand hygiene'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with CDI should wash hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, before eating or food preparation, and when hands are visibly soiled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5497300\"><span class=\"h4\">Environmental cleaning and disinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful attention to environmental cleaning of clinical areas where patients with CDI are treated is critical; this includes daily cleaning and cleaning following discharge. </p><p><em>C. difficile</em> spores can survive on dry surfaces for up to several months, and routine disinfection with standard quaternary ammonium-based chemicals does not eliminate <em>C. difficile</em> spores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/5,6,29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,29-35</a>]. Disinfection of clinical areas where patients with CDI are treated requires use of a sporicidal agent (such as bleach or an alternative agent with a <em>C. difficile</em> sporicidal label) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36</a>]. Some sporicidal agents can cause caustic damage to equipment surfaces and cause skin irritation for patients and health care personnel; these issues should be considered in the agent selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/35,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-general-principles#H708071018\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: General principles&quot;, section on 'Healthcare environment: Cleaning and disinfection'</a>.)</p><p>However, interventions that focus only on improving cleaning may not be sufficient to control health care-associated CDI. In one randomized trial including 16 hospitals in Ohio, an environmental disinfection intervention improved the thoroughness and effectiveness of cleaning but did not reduce the incidence of health care-associated CDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>When possible, disposable medical equipment should be used, since multiuse equipment (such as blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, and thermometers) can serve as fomites for <em>C. difficile </em>transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/13,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,40-42</a>]. If use of disposable equipment is not possible, equipment should be dedicated to a single patient with CDI. Equipment that must be shared between patients should be cleaned and disinfected with a sporicidal agent between uses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-general-principles#H3433998688\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: General principles&quot;, section on 'Medical equipment: Disinfection and sterilization'</a>.)</p><p>The impact of ultraviolet (UV) light for disinfection on the incidence of <em>C. difficile</em> infection is uncertain. One report that evaluated the impact UV irradiation following 542 patient discharges noted a reduction in CDI incidence by 25 percent compared with a preintervention baseline period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, in another study that included 21,395 patients (in the intention-to-treat analysis) admitted to rooms from which a patient on contact precautions was discharged, no substantial decrease in <em>C. difficile</em> infection was observed, despite the addition of UV light to bleach disinfection (versus bleach alone) for room cleaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1351971\"><span class=\"h4\">Patient bathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be encouraged to wash hand and shower to reduce the burden of spores on the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Based on available data, the role for routine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> (CHG) bathing for prevention of CDI is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. In one study including administration of more than 68,000 CHG baths, the incidence of CDI decreased with bathing daily (relative risk [RR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.29-0.59) or three times weekly (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, another trial including 9340 adults in intensive care units noted that daily CHG bathing demonstrated no impact on CDI incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2737269719\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic carriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic carriers appear to play a role in <em>C. difficile </em>transmission. The approach to implementing precautions for asymptomatic carriers remains uncertain; further study is needed. In one study that evaluated the effect of detecting and isolating <em>C. difficile</em> carriers, the incidence of health care-associated CDI decreased significantly, from 6.9 to 3.0 per 10,000 patient-days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Moreover, a minority of new CDI cases are molecularly linked to symptomatic CDI cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

It is the most common infectious cause of health care-associated diarrhea and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention and control of <em>C. difficile</em> infection (CDI) in health care settings require early detection and isolation with contact precautions, careful attention to hand hygiene, and effective environmental cleaning. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Infection control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected or proven CDI should be placed on contact precautions, including assignment to a single room with dedicated toileting facilities or cohorting with other patients who have CDI. Gloves and gowns should be donned upon room entry and removed prior to exiting the room. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Contact precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care personnel should perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water following care of patients with suspected or proven CDI; use of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) is not adequate because ABHR does <strong>not</strong> eradicate <em>C. difficile</em> spores. Hand washing with soap and water involves vigorous mechanical scrubbing and rinsing, so it is more effective than ABHR for physical removal of bacterial spores. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hand hygiene'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful attention to environmental cleaning of clinical areas where patients with CDI are treated is critical. <em>C. difficile</em> spores can survive on dry surfaces for up to several months, and routine disinfection with standard quaternary ammonium-based chemicals does not eliminate <em>C. difficile</em> spores. Disinfection of clinical areas where patients with CDI are treated requires use of a sporicidal agent (such as bleach or an alternative agent with a <em>C. difficile</em> sporicidal label). (See <a href=\"#H5497300\" class=\"local\">'Environmental cleaning and disinfection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When possible, disposable medical equipment should be used, since multiuse equipment (such as blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, and thermometers) can serve as fomites for <em>C. difficile </em>transmission. If use of disposable equipment is not possible, equipment should be dedicated to a single patient with CDI. Equipment that must be shared between patients should be cleaned and disinfected with a sporicidal agent between uses. (See <a href=\"#H5497300\" class=\"local\">'Environmental cleaning and disinfection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of antibiotics disrupts the intestinal microbiota and has been linked to <em>C. difficile</em> colonization and disease. Targeted restriction of a particular antibiotic agent or class of agents can facilitate control of hospital outbreaks and reduce CDI rates in the community and in health care settings. Antibiotics frequently associated with increased CDI risk include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and penicillins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55479 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5497421\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic stewardship'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13743063\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Jay McDonald, MD, and Carolyn Gould, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lessa FC, Mu Y, Bamberg WM, et al.
