Graves' disease is by far the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in this age group, accounting for more than 95 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nearly all children with Graves' disease have a diffuse goiter; Graves' ophthalmopathy also may be present, but is less severe than in adults. </p><p>The treatment and prognosis of Graves' disease in childhood and adolescence will be discussed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, conditions other than Graves' disease may cause hyperthyroidism in children. These include chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain's disease), solitary hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules or toxic multinodular goiter, pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-secreting adenoma, and hyperthyroidism induced by iodine, neck trauma, or radiation. Treatment of these conditions is similar to that for adults, except that children with nodular goiters are generally treated with surgery rather than radioactive iodine (RAI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adolescents with Graves' hyperthyroidism can be treated with an antithyroid drug, radioactive iodine (RAI), or thyroidectomy. The choice of therapy is determined by individual consideration of the risks and benefits of the three treatment modalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67833 \">table 1</a>). Regardless of the choice of treatment, all patients will require lifelong monitoring. An overview of treatment is shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107233\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107233 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H238690633\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pediatric endocrinologists recommend antithyroid drug therapy as initial treatment in the hope that the patient will have a remission of the Graves' disease and therefore will remain euthyroid after treatment is discontinued. RAI therapy is generally used for children who do not achieve a permanent remission after a period of treatment with an antithyroid drug, or for those who experience serious adverse effects necessitating discontinuation of antithyroid drug treatment. RAI also may be used as initial treatment for children older than 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Surgical near-total thyroidectomy is an equally effective and safe treatment. </p><p>The primary considerations for each of these therapies are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antithyroid drugs are the best-established treatment in the pediatric age group and provide a chance of permanent remission with euthyroidism. Improvement is gradual, the course of treatment is long, and patients must be monitored for potential side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RAI (if given in a sufficiently high dose) permanently cures hyperthyroidism, replacing it with hypothyroidism, which requires lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Although there are general concerns about the radiation exposure, small studies in children have not shown increased long-term risks of thyroid cancer or other cancers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery provides the most rapid resolution of hyperthyroidism and avoids the theoretical risk of radiation exposure. The patient is exposed to modest surgical risks, is rendered hypothyroid, and requires lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.</p><p/><p>Details about each of these treatments are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithyroid drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children and adolescents with Graves' hyperthyroidism respond well to an antithyroid drug, with 87 to 100 percent becoming euthyroid within a few weeks to a few months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. We recommend using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methimazole</a> (MMI, 0.25 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Propylthiouracil</a> (PTU, 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) is also effective, but has more frequent and severe side effects, including a small risk of severe hepatotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Because of these safety concerns, the Endocrine Society and the American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommend <strong>against</strong> the use of PTU as first-line treatment for Graves' disease in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a boxed warning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H49043606\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and toxicity of thionamides&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Initiating and adjusting therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before initiating therapy, we perform laboratory screening with a white blood cell (WBC) count and differential, along with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The goal is to determine whether there are baseline abnormalities prior to beginning therapy, such as the modest decreases in WBC and elevations in liver enzymes that can be caused by hyperthyroidism itself. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dosing</strong> &ndash; We choose an initial MMI dose between 0.25 and 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (given in once daily or in two divided doses), based on clinical severity, size of goiter, and biochemical severity. Patients with mild features of hyperthyroidism, a small goiter, and milder elevations of serum-free T4 and T3 are started at the lower end of the dose range (around 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span>. Patients with more severe clinical features of hyperthyroidism, a large goiter, and more severe elevations of serum-free T4 and T3 are started at the higher end of the dose range (0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span>. Children younger than seven years of age typically also require this higher dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Since MMI is available as 5 mg or 10 mg tablets, for practical purposes we round off the dose so that whole or half tablets can be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequently, we adjust the MMI dose based on serial measurements of serum free T4 and total T3. We measure these every four to six weeks initially. We measure total T3 rather than free T3 because assays for free T3 are less accurate, and age-reference ranges for children are still being established. If these values remain elevated, then we increase the dose of MMI by approximately 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> increments (again rounding the dose to whole or half tablets) until thyroid function is normal. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) typically remains suppressed until thyroid function normalizes, and it may remain suppressed for several months even after a patient becomes euthyroid. For this reason, we do not measure it until a patient becomes euthyroid, but some clinicians prefer to measure TSH with all monitoring blood draws. After thyroid function has normalized, follow-up visits, with measurement of serum-free T4, T3, and TSH, can be scheduled at three- to four-month intervals. If the free T4 and total T3 levels show a downward trend and fall below the normal range, the dose is titrated down. TSH concentrations are typically included in all blood draws, but may remain suppressed for an extended period of time as a result of prior hyperthyroidism, even after the patient has become euthyroid or even developed hypothyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> &ndash; If a patient develops a febrile illness or pharyngitis, antithyroid drug treatment (usually MMI) should be stopped immediately and WBC and differential measured. We recommend giving patients and parents written instructions that describe these guidelines. If the granulocyte count is normal, antithyroid drug treatment may be restarted. This is important because a potential complication of antithyroid drug treatment is a drop in WBC; rarely, agranulocytosis or even pancytopenia develop, which can be life-threatening if not detected promptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If the granulocyte count is low <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;1500/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> but not meeting criteria for agranulocytosis (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> we hold the MMI, monitoring the WBC twice weekly; these counts usually recover spontaneously within one to two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Once the granulocyte count is <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1500/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> we restart MMI. Agranulocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;500/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> is a contraindication to future antithyroid drug treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Routine (rather than symptom-driven) monitoring of WBC is not recommended because of the rarity of the condition and its sudden onset, which is generally associated with symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, we re-measure liver enzymes and serum bilirubin only if we note any clinical evidence of liver disease, such as jaundice, and not on a routine basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and toxicity of thionamides&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-neutropenia-and-agranulocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49043606\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MMI and PTU are associated with similar types of side effects. However, side effects tend to be more frequent and more severe with PTU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Because of these safety concerns, we recommend <strong>against</strong> the use of PTU as first-line treatment for Graves' disease in children, consistent with positions of the Endocrine Society, the ATA, and the FDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. PTU may be reserved for children who experience a minor side effect with MMI that is not a contraindication to continued antithyroid drug use, and for whom RAI or surgery are not treatment options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Minor adverse effects include papular or urticarial skin rashes, arthralgias, nausea, and abnormal taste sensation, and are more common with PTU than with MMI (30 versus 13 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a series of 100 patients treated with MMI, the following minor side effects were reported: pruritus and hives (8 percent), diffuse arthralgia (3 percent), neutropenia (2 percent), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome and cholestatic jaundice (1 percent each) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In patients who have one of these minor side effects, we discontinue the drug for a few days until the symptom subsides, and then resume it.</p><p>Major adverse effects include agranulocytosis (granulocyte count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> vasculitis (lupus-like syndrome), hepatitis, and liver failure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agranulocytosis occurs in 0.1 to 0.5 percent of patients treated with either PTU or MMI, although the risk is dose-related for MMI and not for PTU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. If agranulocytosis occurs, it usually develops within the first 90 days after starting an antithyroid drug (85 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), markers of vasculitis, are more common with PTU treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. A review reported that ANCA are present in 4 to 64 percent of patients on PTU and 0 to 16 percent of patients on MMI; however, only about 15 percent (1 in 6) of ANCA-positive patients develop clinical evidence of vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe hepatitis develops in up to 0.1 percent of children treated with PTU, with liver failure occurring in 1:2000 to 1:4000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]. Almost all cases of severe hepatitis have been associated with PTU treatment. Routine biochemical surveillance of liver function probably is not effective in avoiding the risk of liver failure. </p><p/><p>Any patient who has a major side effect should be treated with RAI or surgery instead of antithyroid medication.

Birth defects in babies born to mothers who take MMI and PTU in the first trimester occur at about twice the rate of a control population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. MMI is associated with an embryopathy characterized by cutis aplasia, congenital heart defects (septal defects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], urinary tract malformations and omphalocele; PTU is associated with malformations of the face and neck and urinary tract malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Adding beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop prominent symptoms of adrenergic overactivity, such as palpitations and tremor, can be treated with beta blockers until thyroid hormone levels decline in response to the antithyroid drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atenolol</a> because it is cardio-selective, and therefore has reduced risk of bronchospasm as compared with other beta blockers. In addition, it is administered once daily, resulting in better compliance. The typical dose of atenolol for children and adolescents is 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Propranolol</a>, which has the potential benefit of decreasing T4 to T3 conversion, is preferred by some clinicians. Propranolol, at a dose of 0.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily, is divided into three or four doses daily. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Thyroxine (&quot;block and replace&quot;)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do <strong>not</strong> recommend adjunctive treatment with thyroxine during MMI therapy, consistent with more current guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Adding thyroxine to the treatment regimen does not affect the likelihood of sustained remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], but does make it more difficult to judge when a remission is likely to have occurred, and therefore when the antithyroid drug can be discontinued. In addition, patients managed with &quot;combination&quot; therapy are more likely to be treated with a higher dose of MMI, exposing them to the dose-related side effects of MMI. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Stopping therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We determine when to stop MMI therapy by titrating the dose against the clinical and biochemical response, rather than giving the drug for an arbitrary time period (as is often done in adults). As the hyperthyroidism improves with therapy, we gradually reduce the dose to maintain normal levels of free T4, total T3, and TSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107233\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107233 \">algorithm 1</a>). When only a low dose is needed to maintain a euthyroid state (eg, 2.5 to 5 mg of MMI), which typically occurs with a decrease in size of the thyroid gland, we stop the drug and follow the patient closely as described below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Lifelong monitoring'</a> below.) </p><p>In our practice, we do not rely on measurements of serum TSH receptor antibody titers (TSHR-Ab) to decide when to stop MMI therapy, although others find it useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In one report, 100 percent of children who had recurrent hyperthyroidism after antithyroid drug therapy was discontinued had detectable TSHR-Ab in their serum when therapy was discontinued; in contrast, 78 percent of those who remained euthyroid had no detectable serum TSHR-Ab when treatment was discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As a matter of clinical practice, however, it is simpler to discontinue drug therapy and follow the patients at regular intervals. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Remission rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of remission of Graves' hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents (defined as the proportion of patients who remain euthyroid for at least six months after discontinuation of antithyroid drug therapy) varied from 25 to 65 percent in different series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2-6,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6,32,33</a>]. </p><p>In children, prolonged courses of antithyroid drugs are often necessary and efficacious. Many pediatric endocrinologists prescribe antithyroid drugs for many years until a remission occurs, providing this continues to be the preferred treatment choice of the patient and parents and no major side effects occur. In adults, studies suggest that remission rates are higher if therapy is continued for more than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] but that rates of remission are not improved if therapy is continued beyond 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Remission rates in children are illustrated by the following examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large and well-designed study of antithyroid drug treatment in children suggests that prolonged use of antithyroid drugs leads to remission in many children. In this study, 25 percent of children went into a remission every two years, with a 50 percent remission rate at 4.5 years of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, 154 French children were treated with an antithyroid drug for three consecutive treatment cycles, each lasting two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The thionamide drug used in most of these patients was carbimazole, which is not available in the United States.

Remission was defined as maintenance of euthyroidism for more than 12 months after discontinuing antithyroid drug treatment and the absence of any relapses during the follow-up period (median 5.8 years, range 1.0 to 24.8 years). </p><p/><p>Predictors of remission in the same multicenter trial were lower thyroid hormone concentrations at presentation, older age, and euthyroid status after three months of antithyroid drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Similarly, another series found that prepubertal children may take longer to enter remission than pubertal children (median time to remission eight versus four years) and are also less likely to enter remission even after prolonged treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

However, some patients who do not achieve a remission while on antithyroid drug therapy may eventually choose to proceed to a definitive treatment (eg, when leaving home for college).

Most relapses occur within one year, but later relapses do occur. The risk of relapse is higher in non-Caucasians and in patients with higher initial free T4; the risk decreases with increasing age and with longer duration of antithyroid drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Children who relapse can be treated with any of the same three treatment modalities offered to newly diagnosed patients (ie, resuming MMI, or moving on to RAI or surgery). The choice of treatment is usually driven by patient and parent preference. Younger patients and those previously treated with antithyroid drugs for shorter periods are usually restarted on MMI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Radioactive iodine</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H848212820\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient selection and dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RAI (131-I) therapy is an effective alternative treatment for children and adolescents with Graves' hyperthyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107233\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107233 \">algorithm 1</a>). We recommend it as secondary therapy for patients who have recurrent hyperthyroidism after long-term treatment with an antithyroid drug who request definitive treatment, and for those who have a major side effect while receiving an antithyroid drug. However, some pediatric endocrinologists consider it the initial treatment of choice in older children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,43,44</a>].

The guidelines further recommend that RAI should <strong>not</strong> be used in children younger than five years of age, and that if it is used in children between 5 and 10 years of age the total dose should be limited as discussed below. This recommendation is based on observations suggesting that the young thyroid gland may be particularly sensitive to radiation, raising the theoretical concern that young children might therefore have an increased risk for thyroid cancer after radiation exposure (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Other side effects'</a> below). For children with a very large goiter, surgery may be more effective than RAI, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RAI should not be selected for children who have evidence for a &quot;destructive&quot; form of hyperthyroidism, as is usually the case with thyrotoxicosis resulting from Hashitoxicosis. Most children with Hashitoxicosis will have a negative thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) test, and RAI uptake will be low or nil, separating them from children with Graves' disease. However, in some cases it may be impossible to distinguish all those with Hashitoxicosis from Graves' disease initially, because some children with Hashitoxicosis may have positive TSI and elevated 24-hour 123-I uptake at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. During the hyperthyroid phase, clinical clues that suggest Hashitoxicosis rather than Graves' disease include relatively rapid resolution of their hyperthyroidism during treatment with antithyroid drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents#H4740582\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis with thyrotoxic phase: &quot;Hashitoxicosis&quot;'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dose</strong> &ndash; We and many other endocrinologists, including published guidelines, now recommend relatively high doses of RAI (eg, 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">microCi/gram</span> of thyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,46</a>]; except that for children between 5 and 10 years, the total dose should be limited to &lt;10 milliCi. This dose leads to permanent resolution of the hyperthyroidism in a high percentage of patients; in addition, ablation of the gland likely will reduce the risk of future thyroid tumor development. This dose will lead to hypothyroidism in most patients, necessitating life-long thyroid hormone replacement. In order to get a quantitative assessment of thyroid gland weight, guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound examination prior to RAI administration, rather than an estimate based on neck palpation (assume 1 cc = 1 gram) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Antithyroid drugs should be stopped seven days before RAI administration, to permit adequate uptake of RAI by the thyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Historically, lower treatment doses of RAI were used, intended to achieve euthyroidism, but not hypothyroidism. Higher dosing is now generally preferred because this will ensure that hyperthyroidism will not recur, and it may reduce the risk of thyroid tumor development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In one study, RAI doses of 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">microCi/gram</span> of thyroid tissue, 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">microCi/gram,</span> and 330 <span class=\"nowrap\">microCi/gram</span> resulted in hypothyroidism in 50, 70, and 95 percent of children with Graves' hyperthyroidism, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a separate study, a fixed dose of 14.7 milliCi (range 13.8 to 15.6 milliCi) produced permanent hypothyroidism in all patients, at an average of 77 days (range 28 to 194 days) after receiving the RAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Although the recommended doses are higher than those used in the past for treatment of hyperthyroidism, they are still substantially lower than treatment doses for differentiated thyroid cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other considerations</strong> &ndash; In addition, the clinician should take into account certain factors that may predict a poor response to RAI treatment in children. The following factors were found in one study of 48 children treated with an average RAI dose of 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">microCi/gram</span> of thyroid tissue (where poor response is defined as requiring a second RAI dose or not achieving hypothyroidism by six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Graves' eye disease (58 versus 8 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prior use of an antithyroid drug (37 versus 0 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An interval of greater than 12 months from diagnosis to RAI treatment (50 versus 10 percent) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of these risk factors should not preclude RAI treatment for several reasons: First, it is possible that children with Graves' eye disease have a more severe form of hyperthyroidism, and so perhaps they need a higher dose of RAI. Second, regarding prior use of antithyroid drugs, the patients in this study discontinued the antithyroid drug only three to five days before RAI administration, which may have reduced the efficacy of RAI by inhibiting its uptake in the thyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Third, the poor response in patients with a longer interval between diagnosis and RAI treatment does not necessarily mean that RAI should be used as primary therapy. Indeed, in this study most patients had been treated with antithyroid drugs before moving on to RAI as secondary therapy, and their outcomes were reasonably good: 89 percent of these patients became hypothyroid after one dose of RAI (using a dose of 160 microCi [5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">MBq]/gram</span> of thyroid tissue), while the other 11 percent responded to a second dose of RAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is no evidence that RAI causes or worsens Graves' ophthalmopathy in children or adolescents, as has been described in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. Because the antithyroid action of RAI is relatively slow, patients with many or bothersome symptoms may benefit from treatment with a beta blocker (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atenolol</a> preferred) or an antithyroid drug for four to eight weeks after being given a therapeutic dose of RAI.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in adults, the major consequence of RAI treatment is hypothyroidism. With the conventional doses used in the past, from 20 to 40 percent of patients become hypothyroid in the first year and 2 to 3 percent per year thereafter. With the higher doses described above, virtually all will become hypothyroid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We measure serum-free T4 and TSH six weeks after RAI treatment, and then at three-month intervals. When hypothyroidism develops, it is treated with thyroid hormone replacement, similar to other causes of hypothyroidism. Laboratory monitoring can be performed less frequently thereafter, usually every six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence&quot;, section on 'Treatment and prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Other side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate side effects of RAI include local pain associated with radiation thyroiditis and the rare risk of &quot;thyroid storm&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Long-term, the reservations about the use of RAI in children and adolescents have centered on the possibility that the treatment could result in thyroid or other tumors, affect fertility, or damage sperm or ova, thereby affecting the patient's offspring. </p><p>The concern about thyroid cancer arose from observations of the increased incidence of thyroid cancer in infants and children who were exposed to external radiation during the 1940s and 1950s for a variety of &quot;indications&quot; including enlarged tonsils, croup (large thymus), or acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In addition, there was a dramatic rise in thyroid cancer in children exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear accident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-induced thyroid cancer&quot;</a>). However, it should be noted that there is increasing evidence to suggest that exposure to therapeutic or diagnostic doses of RAI does not increase the risk of thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The exposures at Hiroshima, Chernobyl, and to external beam radiation all included ionizing radiation. By contrast, among children whose environmental exposure was limited to RAI, there is no increase in thyroid cancer or autoimmune thyroid disease with up to 50 years follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Similarly, in one older study in children treated with lower doses of RAI, there was a small increase in the incidence of benign thyroid adenomas, but no increase in thyroid carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Subsequent studies have not revealed an increased risk of thyroid cancer, leukemia, or other cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. These findings are reassuring, but due to the relatively small number of children treated with RAI, a small risk of other cancers cannot be excluded.</p><p>Among children of women treated with RAI during childhood or adolescence, 3 percent have congenital anomalies, a value that is not different from the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], and the incidence of infertility, miscarriage, and prematurity is not increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery, usually subtotal thyroidectomy, is an effective therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism. Surgery is most commonly used as a secondary treatment option in children. When antithyroid drug therapy fails or causes side effects, many clinicians, children or adolescents, or their parents prefer surgery to RAI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107233\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107233 \">algorithm 1</a>). In particular, thyroidectomy is the preferred treatment for Graves' disease in children younger than five years of age when definitive therapy is required because RAI is not recommended for this young age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Surgery also may be particularly appropriate for those with very large goiter, as studies in adults suggest that individuals with large thyroid glands (greater than 80 grams) are unlikely to respond to RAI treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Selection of surgery for treatment also depends on availability of an experienced thyroid surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Surgery also may be offered as a primary treatment option, particularly in younger children or those with large thyroid glands, for the reasons noted above. &#160;</p><p>If surgery is planned, the patient should be treated with an antithyroid drug, if possible, or at least a beta blocker and inorganic iodine before surgery is undertaken. Treatment with iodine pre-operatively has been shown to reduce thyroid blood flow and blood loss during surgery. We use either of the following for seven to ten days prior to surgery: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium iodide and iodine (Lugol solution; 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/drop,</span> 20 drops per mL), 1 drop by mouth three times daily, <strong>or</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium iodide (SSKI, Thyroshield; 35 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/drop),</span> 1 drop by mouth daily. </p><p/><p>A beta blocker, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atenolol</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> once daily) over this same seven- to ten-day period, will help to reduce adrenergic symptoms. </p><p>The operation of choice is near-total thyroidectomy, to reduce the risk of persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism as much as possible.</p><p>The complications of surgery in children are similar to those in adults, and mortality is very rare. Transient hypocalcemia occurs in approximately 10 percent of children, and permanent hypoparathyroidism in 2 percent. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve occurs in approximately 1 percent, and postoperative hemorrhage in 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Hypothyroidism occurs in approximately one-half of patients within the first year after surgery, and in about 1 to 2 percent per year thereafter.

For those who become hypothyroid after any of these treatments, lifelong monitoring will be needed to manage thyroid hormone replacement. For those who enter remission and remain euthyroid after antithyroid drug therapy is discontinued (and also for the small percentage of patients who are euthyroid after radioactive iodine [RAI] or surgery), lifelong monitoring will be needed to detect hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, which may develop at any time. </p><p>Monitoring consists of checking serum-free T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) every six months until growth and puberty are complete. After completion of growth, we monitor yearly. Females should be counseled that when they reach reproductive age there is a risk of neonatal Graves' disease in their offspring because of persistent stimulatory antibodies to the TSH receptor (anti-TSHR-Ab) that cross the placenta.
