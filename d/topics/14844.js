Pharmacologic sedation and paralysis are induced in rapid succession to quickly and effectively perform laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.</p><p>Outside of the operating room, RSI is generally the preferred method for emergently intubating patients who have varying levels of consciousness and are presumed to have a full stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RSI provides optimal conditions for emergent intubation. We recommend that clinicians who are trained in tracheal intubation use RSI for most children who require emergent intubation and who are not in cardiac arrest or already deeply comatose. The goal of RSI is to intubate patients quickly and safely using sedation and paralysis. RSI is generally recommended because it is more successful and safer than intubation without sedation and paralysis for patients with varying levels of consciousness, active protective airway reflexes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a full stomach.</p><p>A simple, systematic approach to preparation and execution of the procedure is necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51456 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111721\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111721 \">figure 1</a>). In the majority of situations, RSI, from the decision to intubate to successful intubation, is accomplished in less than 10 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77060 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Emergency intubations in children can be performed with or without sedation and paralysis. However, up to 80 percent are performed using RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The superiority of RSI, as compared with intubation without sedation and paralysis, has been demonstrated by clinical experience and several small retrospective as well as one large prospective observational series in which success rates for intubation were significantly higher and the incidence of adverse events was significantly lower using RSI in the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. As an example, in one large multicenter prospective surveillance study of over 1000 pediatric intubations, RSI was associated with a significantly higher first past success rate (83 percent) than sedation without paralysis (55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>RSI can be safely performed by emergency physicians trained in advanced airway management, including the use of medications for sedation and paralysis. This has been demonstrated in multiple large series of adult patients and several small pediatric series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach/abstract/2,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8-11</a>].</p><p>Sedation and paralysis are unnecessary prior to intubation for some patients, such as those who are in cardiac arrest or already deeply comatose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1974025919\"><span class=\"h1\">PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no absolute contraindications to RSI. However, because sedation and paralysis eliminate protective airway reflexes and spontaneous respiration, RSI must be modified for the patient for whom bag-mask ventilation and intubation may be more difficult. An alternative plan is warranted for these patients that may involve alternatives such as special airway devices, assistance from subspecialists (anesthesiologists, otorhinolaryngologists, or intensivists), if available, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intubation with sedation, but without paralysis.

An alternative plan is warranted for these patients that may involve alternatives such as special airway devices, assistance from subspecialists (anesthesiologists, otorhinolaryngologists, or intensivists), if available, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intubation with sedation, but without paralysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;, section on 'Identification of the difficult pediatric airway'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sequential steps involved in RSI are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51456 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Preparation</strong> &ndash; A checklist can ensure that all key aspects of preparation occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111721\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111721 \">figure 1</a>). In the preparation phase of RSI, a rapid review of key aspects of the child's history, as well as a targeted physical examination, helps identify conditions that affect the optimal choices of medications and the need for specialty assistance to manage the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71326 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64336\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64336 \">table 4</a>). In addition, equipment for monitoring and airway management should be assembled and its function checked. This is done as the patient is being preoxygenated. (See <a href=\"#H2396619866\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Preoxygenation</strong> &ndash; Oxygen should be administered at the highest concentration available as soon as RSI is being considered. Children who have insufficient respiratory reserve or who are experiencing apnea may require careful BMV with small tidal volumes to achieve adequate preoxygenation. Cricoid pressure (Sellick maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71800\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71800 \">figure 2</a>)) is optional to help prevent gastric insufflation during BMV but should be immediately removed if it causes obstruction of the airway. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Preoxygenation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Protection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pretreatment</strong> &ndash; Pretreatment medications are optional for selected patients as described in the rapid overview (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51456 \">table 1</a>) and above and are used in a minority of children undergoing RSI. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Sedation </strong>&ndash; The following are our recommendations for the preferred sedative agent for RSI depending upon patient characteristics (see <a href=\"#H363050261\" class=\"local\">'Selection of sedative agent'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Hemodynamically stable</strong> &ndash; For hemodynamically stable children without other complicating clinical features, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etomidate</a> for sedation during RSI. If available, thiopental is also an acceptable choice (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We recognize that thiopental may not be commercially available, and others may choose etomidate because of concern for unanticipated hypotension with thiopental in patients who initially appear stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Increased intracranial pressure (ICP)</strong> &ndash; For children with suspected increased ICP who are hemodynamically stable, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etomidate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a>, or, if available, thiopental as the sedative agent for RSI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For children with suspected increased ICP who are hemodynamically unstable, we suggest using etomidate (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Septic shock</strong> &ndash; For children with septic shock, we suggest administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> for sedation during RSI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, whenever possible, hemodynamically unstable patients should receive rapid fluid infusion and, if needed, vasopressor agents prior to RSI. For hemodynamically <strong>unstable</strong> children in septic shock with contraindications to ketamine or if ketamine is unavailable, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etomidate</a> or, if in a potentially catecholamine-depleted stated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> as a sedative agent for RSI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If etomidate is used, the emergency clinician should inform the physician assuming care in the intensive care unit that etomidate has been used and should avoid repeated bolus doses or etomidate infusion to maintain sedation after intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Status asthmaticus</strong> &ndash; For children with status asthmaticus, we suggest administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> for sedation during RSI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Status epilepticus</strong> &ndash; For hemodynamically stable children in status epilepticus, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a>, or, if available, thiopental for sedation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For the patient in status epilepticus who is hemodynamically unstable, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etomidate</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Paralysis</strong> &ndash; Paralytic agents provide complete muscle relaxation, which facilitates rapid tracheal intubation. They do <strong>not</strong> provide sedation, analgesia, or amnesia. Thus, a sedative agent <strong>must</strong> also be used both for RSI and when paralysis is maintained after intubation:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Our recommendations for preferred paralytics during RSI in children are as follows (see <a href=\"#H790016306\" class=\"local\">'Selection of paralytic agent'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For paralysis of children undergoing RSI, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">succinylcholine</a>, if not contraindicated, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rocuronium</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sugammadex-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sugammadex</a> immediately available for reversal (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">succinylcholine</a> cannot be used because of contraindications, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rocuronium</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vecuronium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancuronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pancuronium</a>, regardless of the availability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sugammadex-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sugammadex</a>, because of its shorter duration of action (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Protection and positioning</strong> &ndash; Ideally, with appropriate positioning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69636\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69636 \">picture 1</a>) and laryngoscopy, the vocal cords and glottis will be quickly identified. If little or none of the glottic opening is visualized:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>External laryngeal manipulation (ELM) may improve the view although evidence is limited for this technique in infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111812\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111812 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64433 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1519186975\" class=\"local\">'External laryngeal manipulation (bimanual laryngoscopy)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In young infants, gentle cricoid pressure, applied over the anterior neck at the cricoid cartilage, may also improve the glottic view. When used, cricoid pressure (Sellick maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71800\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71800 \">figure 2</a>)) should be applied after the sedative is administered and the patient becomes unconscious. If cricoid pressure worsens the view, it should be removed immediately and ELM attempted. (See <a href=\"#H4209510167\" class=\"local\">'Cricoid pressure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Every effort must be made to avoid BMV during RSI. However, if significant hypoxemia occurs, BMV may be necessary. Cricoid pressure during BMV is optional and may prevent gastric distension. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Protection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Placement, with confirmation</strong> &ndash; Tracheal placement should be confirmed by primary methods (such as auscultation for breath sounds over lung fields and stomach, the appearance of mist inside the tracheal tube, and symmetric chest rise with positive pressure ventilation) as well as confirmation with detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>). (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Placement, with confirmation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Postintubation management</strong> &ndash; Following placement and confirmation, the tracheal tube should be appropriately secured. A chest radiograph should also be obtained to document proper depth of placement and evaluate pulmonary status. Ongoing sedation with benzodiazepines, analgesia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> or, if hemodynamically stable, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a>), and paralysis are typically required immediately after RSI. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Postintubation management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The factors underlying the decision to intubate, as well as procedures for laryngoscopy and intubation are discussed separately.
