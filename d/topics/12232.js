In the past, fracture incidence rates ranging from 10 to 65 percent were reported (eg, 10 to 36 percent after heart transplantation and 24 to 65 percent after liver transplantation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. However, in some studies, the rate of posttransplant fracture is decreasing, in part due to increased recognition of the problem, which has resulted in changes in immunosuppressive regimens (reduction in dose and duration of glucocorticoids), earlier treatment for osteoporosis, and improvement in pre- and posttransplantation nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a retrospective review of 531 records from 592 eligible patients undergoing liver transplantation at a single center between 1998 and 2008, following the introduction of a protocol for bone health assessment and management, posttransplant fractures occurred in 3.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113486706\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transplant-related osteoporosis and fracture are due to both pre- and posttransplant factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63584 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Pretransplant risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients undergoing transplantation already have low bone mineral density (BMD).

(See <a href=\"#H4075139643\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p>A large proportion of posttransplant fractures occur during the brief phase of rapid bone loss that occurs in the first six months after transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79240\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79240 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/2,4,5,13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,13,20</a>]. The fracture rate is highest in patients with low pretransplant bone mass who lose bone rapidly; however, a substantial proportion of men with normal BMD before transplant may still fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a multivariate analysis of a nested case-control study of transplant recipients (kidney, liver, lung, and heart), a history of hyperthyroidism, pretransplant diabetes, fracture, or corticosteroid use, as well as current exposure to antidepressants, narcotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, and loop diuretics were significant risk factors for posttransplant fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Use of bisphosphonates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> was also a predictor of fracture, likely indicating the presence of pretransplant osteoporosis.</p><p>The incidence of fracture falls as bone loss slows 6 to 24 months after transplantation. Studies of up to three to four years duration show that lumbar spine (LS) BMD begins to recover during the second and third years and often returns to baseline, whereas femoral neck (FN) BMD remains below baseline levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/2,11,15,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,15,22,23</a>]. As an example, in a prospective study of 280 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, LS and FN BMD decreased by 5.8 and 8.5 percent, respectively, in the first year after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although LS BMD returned to baseline during the four-year study, FN BMD did not recover completely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17628951\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects of immunosuppressive regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunosuppressive drugs, particularly glucocorticoids, contribute to posttransplant bone loss and fracture. Glucocorticoids are administered in large doses initially and then tapered over time; dose increases for episodes of rejection or graft versus host disease are not uncommon. The doses of glucocorticoids used in modern-day transplantation, however, are much lower and tapered more rapidly than in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The predominant effect of glucocorticoids on the skeleton is reduced bone formation. The decline in bone formation may be mediated by direct inhibition of osteoblast proliferation and by increased apoptosis of osteoblasts and mature osteocytes. Glucocorticoids also increase bone resorption by increasing osteoclastogenesis. In addition, glucocorticoids decrease secretion of androgens and estrogens, primarily mediated by inhibition of gonadotropin secretion, and increase secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The etiology of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Calcineurin inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) may also contribute to posttransplant bone loss. There is some evidence that cyclosporine may increase bone turnover in humans. However, the effect of cyclosporine on bone metabolism in humans is less clear, being confounded by the presence of other illnesses or drugs that affect bone, particularly glucocorticoids (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that affect bone metabolism&quot;, section on 'Cyclosporine'</a>). Tacrolimus appears to have less adverse effect on bone than cyclosporine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, rapamycin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> have shown no effects on bone volume in a rat model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H847380527\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETRANSPLANTATION EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) of the hip or spine before transplantation in all patients.

In these trials, six months of resistance exercise training (including lumbar extension exercise and variable resistance exercises with a specialized fitness equipment) restored BMD toward pretransplantation values.

The optimal approach to the prevention of bone loss and fractures among renal transplant recipients is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation#H3087706551\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone disease after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Prevention of osteoporosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation#H998152965\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent hyperparathyroidism after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Before transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>However, an alternative approach to the management of patients due to receive a transplant is to apply similar guidelines as those used for the prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. As discussed above, early posttransplant bone loss is primarily due to the effects of glucocorticoids. There are several guidelines for the prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Collectively, they suggest preventive therapy for patients based upon risk for fracture (eg, previous osteoporotic fracture, BMD T-score) and guided, in part, by the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (<a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2043\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX</a>).

In randomized trials of bisphosphonates for the prevention of transplantation-related osteoporosis, patient recruitment was not based upon a particular BMD T-score criterion or clinical risk factor (other than transplantation). Thus, it is difficult to determine the best candidates for preventive therapy. Given that rapid bone loss may ensue immediately after transplant, many experts recommend preventive medical therapy for all transplant recipients, regardless of pretransplant BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/13,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25</a>]. This approach is supported by observational data that show overlap in pretransplant BMD values between those who do and do not fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In addition, the duration of preventive therapy for transplant recipients may be as short as one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], which reduces concerns about adverse effects and cost. For these reasons, we initiate preventive medical therapy in all transplant recipients, continue it for the first 12 months, and then reevaluate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of initial medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bisphosphonates are considered the medical therapy of choice for the prevention of transplantation-related bone loss. Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in premenopausal women, however, because of insufficient information on the potential for harm to the fetus in women who become pregnant while receiving or shortly after discontinuing bisphosphonates. If bisphosphonates are contraindicated or not tolerated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> or <span class=\"nowrap\">estradiol/progesterone</span> therapy (in women with hypogonadism) are alternatives. Treatment with calcitriol requires monitoring of serum and urinary calcium levels, making it less convenient than bisphosphonates in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H4103661588\" class=\"local\">'Calcitriol'</a> below.)</p><p>Bisphosphonates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> appear to prevent fractures. In a meta-analysis of 11 trials (780 patients) evaluating treatment with bisphosphonates (nine trials) or vitamin D analogs (two trials) versus placebo or no treatment after solid organ (liver, heart, kidney) transplantation, there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with fractures one year posttransplantation (26 versus 51, odds ratio [OR] 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.83) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-after-solid-organ-or-stem-cell-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There was also a reduction in the total number of fractures (38 versus 89, OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.60) and the number of vertebral fractures (29 versus 78, OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.78). Overall, the number of fracture events was small, limiting the precision of the meta-analysis.
