Macroscopically, there is a scarred appearance with fibrous or fibro-fatty replacement of myocardium. Multiple reports have historically characterized these pathologic changes as the &quot;triangle of dysplasia&quot; involving the inflow tract, outflow tract, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> apex of the RV. However, more recent data have noted involvement of the posterolateral LV with sparing of the RV apex early in the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The RV myocardial scarring initially produces typical regional wall motion abnormalities but later may involve the free wall and become global, producing RV dilation. The tissue replacement can also involve areas of the left ventricle (LV) with relative sparing of the septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The anatomic and histologic findings associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) fall into several categories. Structurally, the hallmark findings are regional, progressing to global, right ventricle (RV) dilation, and myocardial thinning. Most patients also have left ventricle (LV) myocyte loss and fibrosis, usually involving the LV lateral and posterior walls. Histologically, fibrofatty infiltration of the myocardium is the most common finding. In addition, electron microscopy has shown gap junction abnormalities of desmosomes in the RV myocardium, which is consistent with mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins being responsible for ARVC in most patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-pathogenesis-and-genetics#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Pathogenesis and genetics&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical perspectives of ARVC initially arose from experience with patients who present with arrhythmias of right ventricular (RV) origin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sudden death. However, additional information has been learned regarding the clinical features and clinical course of subjects identified based on ECG abnormalities and by cascade family screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Presentation is most common between the ages of 10 and 50 years, with a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The disease is virtually never diagnosed in infants or toddlers and is rarely identified before the age of 10. </p><p>The anatomy, histology, and clinical manifestations of ARVC will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, genetics, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of ARVC are discussed separately.

ARVC is an important cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young adults, accounting for approximately 11 percent of cases overall and 22 percent in athletes in a study from northern Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In contrast, ARVC has been rarely diagnosed in the United States. This may reflect a difference in genetic prevalence, but is more likely due to under-recognition of disease. In a series of 100 ARVC patients from a single referral center in the United States, clinical profiles and event rates were similar to those reported in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>ARVC is an inherited cardiomyopathy that affects a significant number of first-degree relatives of the proband. In a study of 274 first-degree relatives of 138 ARVC probands, in which all the first-degree relatives underwent a detailed medical history, cardiac imaging, and mutation-specific genetic testing (if a definite mutation had been identified in the family's proband), 96 first-degree relatives (35 percent) were ultimately diagnosed with ARVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Siblings had a threefold higher risk of being diagnosed with ARVC compared with other first-degree relatives (odds ratio 3.1; 95% CI 1.7-5.9).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2989424460\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND HISTOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123588400\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localized or generalized dilatation of the RV and myocardial thinning in the regions of dilation are the typical anatomic findings in ARVC. Historically, sites of involvement have been characterized as the so-called &quot;triangle of dysplasia,&quot; which included the RV inflow tract, the RV outflow tract, and posterolateral LV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although initial studies included the RV apex in this triangle, more recent data have noted involvement of the posterolateral LV with sparing of the RV apex early in the disease, and it is now recognized that the RV apex is typically involved in severe and late-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The RV myocardium is typically replaced by fibrous tissue and fat, with scattered residual myocardial cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78104\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78104 \">picture 1</a>). The extent of replacement is variable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4006613941\"><span class=\"h3\">Left ventricular abnormalities and disease progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although less prominent than RV disease, LV involvement is common in patients with ARVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In a report of 42 patients with ARVC diagnosed at autopsy or heart transplantation, 76 percent had fibrofatty involvement of the left ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The likelihood of this occurring increases with age, suggesting that ARVC is a progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The degree of involvement of the LV is related to genotype and is least common with a PKP2 mutation, which is the most common mutation identified in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1492647\" class=\"local\">'Left ventricular involvement'</a> below.) </p><p>Because of the frequency with which LV involvement is observed, particularly in patients with mutations in specific genes (eg, desmoplakin), the field is slowly moving towards replacing the term &quot;arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy&quot; with &quot;arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.&quot; The reluctance to move rapidly in this direction is due in part to the fact the disease in patients with a PKP2 mutation, by far the most common mutation in the United States and certain parts of Europe, is a right dominant disease, with left sided involvement seen only with advanced disease. With increasing use of ICDs and prevention of sudden cardiac death, the development of right- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left-sided heart failure is an important consideration in the management of ARVC, and especially for those with left dominant or biventricular disease. (See <a href=\"#H1492598\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>When considering ARVC, it is important to recognize that this is a progressive disease. Affected individuals do not have evidence of the disease at birth, and typically the disease starts to manifest clinically at approximately 12 or 13 years of age, with the mean age at diagnosis in the early 30s. In one study that examined cardiac function with repeat echocardiography in 85 patients with ARVC after a mean follow-up of six years, RVOT dimension increased from 35 to 37 mm, RV-FAC decreased from 39 to 34 percent, and LVEF decreased from 55 percent to 54 percent, providing evidence that ARVC is associated with deterioration of cardiac function over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These findings, coupled with the findings of other studies that have shown that development of heart failure and need for cardiac transplantation is more common in competitive athletes, support the current recommendations for exercise restriction in patients with ARVC, as well as those at risk of development of ARVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].

This may represent the acute or &quot;hot&quot; phase of the disease in which disrupted intercellular connections result in myocyte cell death and an inflammatory repair process.</p><p>It was initially suggested that there were two distinct types of ARVC with differing histologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In a series of 30 hearts from patients with presumed ARVC, 18 had the fibrolipomatous (fibrofatty) pattern and 12 had the lipomatous (fatty) pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fibrolipomatous (fibrofatty) pattern is characterized by myocardial atrophy and thinning with replacement of myocardium by both fibrous and fatty tissue, as well as patchy inflammatory infiltrates. RV aneurysms and LV involvement are each found in approximately three-quarters of patients with fibrofatty disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lipomatous (fatty) pattern is characterized by normal or increased myocardial thickness with exclusively fatty replacement and infrequent inflammation. In the autopsy series of 12 hearts with the fatty pattern, patchy inflammatory infiltrates were found in only two, RV aneurysms in one, and LV involvement in none [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p>However, at least some cases of fatty infiltration of the RV without fibrosis may represent a distinct pathologic process unrelated to ARVC. This was illustrated in an autopsy study of subjects who died from noncardiac causes, which compared the clinical and pathologic features of 25 hearts with fibrofatty ARVC, 7 with only fatty replacement, and 18 control hearts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. None of the subjects with fatty replacement had a history of arrhythmias or a family history of SCD. In contrast, more than one-half of those with fibrofatty ARVC had these historical features. Epicardial fat infiltration is part of the &quot;normal aging&quot; process of the right ventricle and may confound interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging and autopsy, particularly in adult patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3045395546\"><span class=\"h2\">Electron microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the gene mutations in ARVC involve proteins that make up desmosomes, which are intracellular adhesion complexes that provide mechanical connections between cardiac myocytes. Support for a pathogenic role of these mutations was provided in an electron microscopy study of RV myocardium from 21 ARVC probands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A variety of abnormalities in desmosomal structure, size, number, or location were noted in up to 75 percent of patients with ARVC, but in none of 10 controls or 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1492598\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with ARVC remain clinically silent and asymptomatic for decades, making the disease difficult to recognize, especially in sporadic cases with no recognized familial involvement. The clinical presentations of ARVC are variable, including palpitations, syncope, chest pain, dyspnea, and, rarely, sudden cardiac death. Clinical perspectives of ARVC primarily arise from experience with patients who present with arrhythmia of right ventricular (RV) origin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sudden death. Presentation is most common between the ages of 10 and 50 years, with a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/6-9,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,25</a>]. The disease is virtually never diagnosed in infants or toddlers and uncommonly before the age of 10, while approximately 20 percent of patients are identified after 50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

VT may originate from the RV inflow tract, RV apex, or RV outflow tract.

In a cohort of 37 patients with ARVC and 49 patients with RVOT tachycardia, the following scoring system was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior T wave inversions in leads V1-V3 during sinus rhythm &ndash; 3 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QRS duration in lead I &ge;120 milliseconds during ventricular arrhythmia &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QRS notching during ventricular arrhythmia &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precordial transition in lead V5 or later during ventricular arrhythmia &ndash; 1 point</p><p/><p>Patients with a score of 5 or more were found to have ARVC in 93 percent of instances, with a sensitivity and specificity of 84 and 100 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2204200597\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a clinical entity characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and a specific ventricular pathology. The incidence of ARVC is unknown, but the prevalence in the general adult population is estimated to be approximately 1 in 2000 to 1 in 5000. (See <a href=\"#H1492591\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anatomic and histologic findings associated with ARVC fall into several categories. Structurally, the hallmark findings are right ventricle (RV) dilation, RV dysfunction, and regional RV wall motion abnormalities, although some patients also have left ventricle (LV) involvement. Histologically, fibrofatty infiltration of the myocardium is the most common finding. (See <a href=\"#H2989424460\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and histology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The principle symptoms of ARVC are dizziness, palpitations, and syncope. Other symptoms include atypical chest pain and dyspnea. As many as 40 percent of patients with ARVC are asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H1492605\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias varies with the severity of ARVC. The most common arrhythmia is monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (sustained or nonsustained) with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) occurs in patients with ARVC and can be the first presentation of the disease. Although most sudden cardiac death in ARVC occurs during routine activity, VT and SCD can be exercise-induced. (See <a href=\"#H1492612\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular involvement is more common in patients with ARVC than initially appreciated. Many patients have similar degrees of involvement of both left and right ventricles, some have predominantly or solely RV involvement, and relatively few have predominantly LV disease. (See <a href=\"#H1492647\" class=\"local\">'Left ventricular involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for ARVC includes various forms of congenital heart disease, particularly those involving left to right shunts, other cardiomyopathies with RV involvement, Uhl's anomaly, idiopathic RV tachycardia, myocarditis, and sarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"#H3028749149\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis for ARVC'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-anatomy-histology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gemayel C, Pelliccia A, Thompson PD.
