Lassa fever was first recognized in Lassa, Nigeria, in 1969 and is endemic to West Africa; there are approximately 300,000 cases and 5000 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/4-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-12</a>]. The animal reservoir is the rodent &quot;multimammate rat&quot; (<em>Mastomys natalensis</em>); transmission to humans occurs via contact with infected rodent urine and feces and via person-to-person contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13</a>]. Lassa virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Arenaviridae family and has been classified as a category A bioterrorism agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Issues specific to Lassa fever will be reviewed here.

Cases have been reported in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and Burkina Faso, and there is serologic evidence of Lassa virus infection among individuals in Togo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/17-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-26</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of Lassa virus infections varies within endemic areas; the incidence is highest in the forested regions of West Africa where Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone share a border [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/17,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27</a>]. Within Sierra Leone, seroprevalence rates vary from 8 percent in coastal regions to 52 percent in the Eastern Province [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In Guinea, the seroprevalence rate varies from 4 to 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].</p><p>Cases of Lassa fever occur at all times of year; the peak incidence occurs in March, during the transition from dry to wet season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/5,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31</a>]. In addition, there is a smaller increase in incidence in December, during the middle of the dry season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Lassa virus infection poses a significant healthcare burden in high-incidence regions. In one study examining admissions to two hospitals in Sierra Leone, Lassa fever cases resulted in 10 to 16 percent of medical admissions and 30 percent of all deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2399476401\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modes of Lassa fever transmission include rodent contact and person-to-person contact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1464461432\"><span class=\"h3\">Rodent contact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary mode of transmission to humans is via exposure to infected <em>Mastomys</em> rodents; this may occur via direct contact with rodent urine and feces, inhalation of aerosolized rodent excretions, or consumption of infected rodents as a food source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13</a>].</p><p><em>Mastomys</em> rodent infestation is associated with households built of poor-quality materials, such as crumbling mud, which facilitates rodent burrows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In one study, residences of patients with Lassa virus infection were 10 times more likely to be infested with <em>Mastomys</em> rodents than residences with no cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Individuals with a history of routine <em>Mastomys</em> rodent consumption are more than twice as likely to have serologic evidence of Lassa virus infection as individuals who do not consume the rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, <em>Mastomys</em> rodent consumption is associated with a fourfold increase in deafness, a common sequela of Lassa fever infection. (See <a href=\"#H1876040219\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H504168341\"><span class=\"h3\">Person-to-person</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Person-to-person transmission may occur after exposure to Lassa virus in the blood, urine, feces, or other bodily secretions of an infected individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Lassa virus infection is not thought to spread through casual contact (such as hugging, shaking hands, or sitting near someone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Individuals with Lassa virus infection are not believed to be contagious prior to onset of symptoms.</p><p>Individuals in close contact with patients, including healthcare workers, are at risk for transmission of infection via body fluids and airborne droplets in the absence of appropriate protective measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/11,28,36,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28,36,40</a>]. Nosocomial outbreaks of Lassa fever have been described, and enhanced precautions must be taken when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/10,11,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,41,42</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2995900830\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>Risk for person-to-person transmission of Lassa virus persists after recovery; the virus is shed in the urine for three to nine weeks and in the semen for up to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sexual transmission of Lassa fever infection during convalescence has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H35866001\" class=\"local\">'Sexual transmission'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33858528\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection with Lassa virus generally occurs via the nasopharyngeal mucosa, where it infects dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. Subsequently, the virus spreads to regional lymph nodes before disseminating to virtually all tissues. Inflammatory cell infiltrate of infected organs tends to be minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]; necrosis can occur, particularly in the liver and spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Hepatic necrosis can be significant, involving up to 40 percent of hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Splenic necrosis, adrenocortical and pituitary necrosis, interstitial myocarditis, alveolar edema, and renal tubular injury are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/6,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,46,47</a>].</p><p>Severe disease appears to result from vascular instability and impaired hemostasis. Lassa virus stimulates macrophages and dendritic cells to release soluble mediators resulting in the endothelial dysfunction, insufficient effective circulating intravascular volume, and multiorgan failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. This results in pleural effusions and pulmonary edema, ascites, and hemorrhagic manifestations of the gastrointestinal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/6,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,51</a>]. Hemorrhage has also been associated with a circulating inhibitor of platelet aggregation and thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Among survivors, Lassa virus levels peak between days 4 and 9 of illness, and serum viral RNA can be detected for up to three weeks after recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/36,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,53,54</a>]. Cell-mediated immunity is predominantly responsible for survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/48,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,55,56</a>]. Neutralizing antibodies appear after recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/36,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,43</a>].</p><p>In fatal cases, the cellular response to Lassa virus infection appears to be weak. Lassa virus does not activate monocytes and macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines among fatal cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. This virus-induced immunosuppression may allow the Lassa virus to replicate unchecked in fatal cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1876040219\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785382394\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lassa virus infection is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incubation period is one to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/6,27,32,59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27,32,59-61</a>]. Individuals with Lassa virus infection are not believed to be contagious prior to onset of symptoms. Most infected individuals (approximately 80 percent) have mild symptoms (low-grade fever, malaise, and headache) and may not seek medical attention.</p><p>Disease progresses to more serious signs and symptoms in approximately 20 percent of patients; these include pharyngitis, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, retrosternal chest pain, back pain, and abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In severe cases, facial swelling, pulmonary edema, bleeding (from the mouth, nose, vagina, or gastrointestinal tract), and hypotension may develop. Proteinuria may be noted. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the later stages.</p><p>The most common complication of Lassa fever is deafness, which occurs in up to one-third of patients and may develop in the setting of mild or severe illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/32,63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,63-66</a>]. Onset of hearing loss may occur during acute illness or during convalescence. Hearing may improve after one to three months in approximately half of cases.</p><p>Patients who recover generally begin to improve after 8 to 10 days of symptom onset. Some patients have signs of improvement followed by relapse of fever with pulmonary edema.</p><p>Poor prognostic factors include the presence of vomiting, sore throat, tachypnea, bleeding, and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/6,32,36,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,32,36,43</a>]. High-level viremia at presentation (determined by measurement of serum antigen or genomic copies) has been correlated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/36,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,67,68</a>].</p><p>Death usually occurs within two weeks after onset of symptoms in fatal cases. Approximately 1 percent of Lassa virus infections result in death; among hospitalized patients, case-fatality rates range from 15 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Encephalopathy has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. It is not clear whether these clinical manifestations reflect direct viral invasion of the central nervous system, an immune response, or metabolic disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head and neck &ndash; Cervical lymphadenopathy is a common symptom of Lassa virus infection.

In one review of electrocardiograms from 32 patients with Lassa fever, 75 percent were abnormal; nonspecific ST and T wave changes were observed in 69 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Myocarditis has been observed in some cases of Lassa fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/6,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,71,72</a>]; nonhuman primate studies have demonstrated that Lassa virus is myocardiotropic, resulting in pulmonary and coronary arteritis as well as perivascular myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In severe cases, abdominal pain is common, likely due to accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash &ndash; A maculopapular rash may appear on the thorax, face, and upper extremities in less than 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; it may be difficult to see in darker-skinned individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage &ndash; Overt hemorrhage occurs in fewer than 20 percent of patients warranting hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32</a>]. Manifestations generally consist of blood oozing from the mouth, nose, vagina, gastrointestinal tract, and cannulation and injection sites. Occasionally, rectal bleeding occurs. The hemorrhagic component of severe Lassa fever cases appears to be due to endovascular leakage as well as inhibition of platelet aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. However, disseminated intravascular coagulation is generally not observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1266652650\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lassa fever is especially severe in late pregnancy; maternal death <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal loss occur in more than 80 percent of cases during the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Pregnant women are more likely to have severe illness due to Lassa virus infection than nonpregnant women.</p><p>A &quot;swollen baby syndrome&quot; has been described among babies born to women infected during the third trimester; it consists of anasarca, abdominal distension, and bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In one study including 18 cases of fetal infection, the mortality rate was 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1547649939\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory findings associated with Lassa fever infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukopenia &ndash; Early in the course of infection, patients generally have a mild leukopenia with a predominant lymphopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lassa-fever/abstract/32,52,59-61,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,52,59-61,78,79</a>].

Spinal fluid analysis in patients with Lassa fever has demonstrated mild to moderate pleocytosis.</p><p/><p>Lassa virus can be transmitted via blood and other body fluids; therefore, when possible, routine laboratory testing (such as complete blood cell counts and metabolic panels) should be done via point-of-care equipment rather than in the hospital laboratory.

The primary mode of transmission to humans is via exposure to infected <em>Mastomys</em> rodents, the animal reservoir; this may occur via direct contact with rodent urine or feces, inhalation of aerosolized rodent excretions, or consumption of infected rodents as a food source. (See <a href=\"#H3717146153\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1464461432\" class=\"local\">'Rodent contact'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Person-to-person transmission of Lassa virus infection may occur after exposure to Lassa virus in the blood, urine, feces, or other bodily secretions of an infected individual. Lassa fever infection is not spread through casual contact (such as hugging, shaking hands, or sitting near someone), and individuals with Lassa fever infection are not believed to be contagious prior to onset of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H504168341\" class=\"local\">'Person-to-person'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incubation period of Lassa fever infection is one to three weeks. Most infected individuals (approximately 80 percent) have mild symptoms (low-grade fever, malaise, and headache) and may not seek medical attention. The most common complication of Lassa fever is deafness, which occurs in up to one-third of patients and may develop in the setting of mild or severe illness. (See <a href=\"#H1876040219\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease progresses to more serious symptoms and signs in approximately 20 percent of patients; these include pharyngitis, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, retrosternal chest pain, back pain, and abdominal pain. Patients who recover generally begin to improve after 8 to 10 days of symptoms. Death usually occurs within two weeks after onset of symptoms in fatal cases. Approximately 1 percent of Lassa virus infections result in death; among hospitalized patients, case-fatality rates range from 15 to 30 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1876040219\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be suspected in individuals with suggestive signs and symptoms (including fever, malaise, headache, pharyngitis, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, chest pain, or hearing loss) in the setting of relevant epidemiologic exposure (residence in or travel to an endemic area with exposure to <em>Mastomys</em> rodents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptomatic individuals with known or suspected Lassa fever in the past three months, or unprotected sexual contact with a person who meets these criteria). The World Health Organization case definition of acute Lassa fever is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109492 \">table 1</a>).

Serum IgM is detectable 10 to 21 days after symptom onset; serum IgG is detectable approximately 21 days after symptom onset. Serum reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is the preferred diagnostic tool for diagnosis of Lassa fever but is rarely used in regions where Lassa fever is endemic because it requires expensive equipment and technical expertise.
