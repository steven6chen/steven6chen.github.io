The time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of pediatric cancer is variable and ranges from a median time of 21 days for neuroblastoma to 72 days for Ewing Sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Primary practitioners may have little experience in diagnosing childhood malignancies and may be reluctant to consider the diagnosis because of the ominous implications. Nonetheless, whether or not they express their concern, patients and parents often are worried about childhood cancer, and the possibility of cancer should be discussed when the initial signs and symptoms are suspicious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Optimal treatment of childhood cancer requires a high level of suspicion by the primary care practitioner and early referral to the pediatric oncologist.

The evaluation and treatment of specific malignancies are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following facts about childhood cancer set the stage for a discussion of issues surrounding clinical assessment of the child with suspected cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although childhood cancers are rare, they are the leading cause of disease-related death in individuals between 1 and 19 years of age in the United States. Boys have significantly higher death rates than girls and adolescents have significantly higher death rates than children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common sites include blood and bone marrow, brain, bone, lymph nodes, nervous system, kidneys, and soft tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99680 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five-year survival rates vary by site, but are approximately 70 to 80 percent when all sites of cancer are considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Survival has increased over the past 15 years with a decrease in mortality rate per one million population at or below 19 years of age from 34.2 to 27.3 between 1990 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 85 percent of pediatric cancers are associated with the presenting signs and symptoms discussed in this topic review; the remaining 10 to 15 percent of tumors are associated with unusual signs and symptoms and are more difficult to diagnose in the early stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Delays in diagnosis have been shown to be related to the child's age (older children are at a higher risk for delay), type of cancer, presentation of symptoms, tumor site, cancer stage, and first medical specialty consulted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although any type of cancer can develop in children of all ages, the frequency of particular histologic types of cancer varies depending upon the age of the child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99680 \">table 1</a>). Neuroblastoma and Wilms' tumor, for example, occur most commonly in children between birth and four years of age, whereas leukemia occurs most often in one- to four-year-old children, and Ewing sarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and thyroid cancer are more common in children older than 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining a detailed history is the first step in evaluating the child with suspected cancer. Emphasis should be placed on the chief complaint. Many of the symptoms that the general public associates with cancer are those that occur with adult-onset malignancies (eg, a change in bowel or bladder habits, a sore that does not heal, unusual bleeding or discharge, thickening or lump in the breast or elsewhere, indigestion or difficulty swallowing, an obvious change in a wart or mole, and a nagging cough or hoarseness). These complaints are unusual in children.</p><p>The following mnemonic was developed by the American Cancer Society to help clinicians remember the early warning signs of childhood cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C</strong>ontinued, unexplained weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>H</strong>eadaches with vomiting in the morning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>I</strong>ncreased swelling or persistent pain in bones or joints, sometimes accompanied by limping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>L</strong>ump or mass in abdomen, neck, or elsewhere</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>D</strong>evelopment of a whitish appearance in the pupil of the eye or sudden changes in vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong>ecurrent fevers not caused by infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>E</strong>xcessive bruising or bleeding (often sudden)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>N</strong>oticeable paleness or prolonged tiredness</p><p/><p>In addition to these warning signs, early detection of childhood cancer requires knowledge of the child's past medical and family history. Certain genetic conditions and immune deficiency syndromes are associated with an increased risk of developing cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68833 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58449 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]; survivors of certain types of childhood cancer (eg, retinoblastoma) are at risk for developing secondary malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The family history should include information about parents, siblings, and first cousins; age, serious illnesses, congenital anomalies, and cause of death for deceased family members should also be elicited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinoblastoma-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinoblastoma: Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Family history'</a>.)</p><p>As a general rule, the diagnostic work-up for and initial management of childhood cancer should be completed under the direction of a pediatric oncologist and preferably in a pediatric oncology center where the necessary subspecialists and tests required for diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment protocols are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. In some cases, administration of emergent therapy is necessary at the time of presentation and may necessitate providing immediate therapy to stabilize the child's condition. In these cases, telephone consultation with a pediatric oncologist is critically important.</p><p>The importance of establishing the correct diagnosis and accurately determining the extent of disease before therapy begins must be emphasized to the parents and the child (if of appropriate age) at the initial evaluation. Such care helps to ensure appropriate therapy and prevents the need for performing repeat examinations and biopsies after the initiation of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Childhood cancer may present with signs and symptoms that are shared by other childhood illnesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74578\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74578 \">table 4</a>). Although assessment for these findings does not always require an evaluation for cancer, certain associated features (eg, headaches associated with vomiting in the morning) are worrisome and warrant immediate evaluation for malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54641 \">table 5</a>). In addition, certain findings (eg, abdominal or mediastinal mass) are independently worrisome and also require immediate evaluation and consultation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3805017\"><span class=\"h2\">Constitutional symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonspecific constitutional symptoms including fatigue, weight loss, and fever are common findings in children with cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever is a common complaint in children. Fever and infection may initially appear to be routine; suspicion for noninfectious causes should be raised when the illness fails to respond to seemingly appropriate therapy. Even when fever is prolonged, infection is the most common cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. In one retrospective series of children with prolonged fever, 2 to 9 percent of cases were attributed to a malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Etiology&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of infection, unresolving or recurring fever may reflect an occult neoplasm, such as lymphoma; rarely, it may be secondary to tumor-related necrosis, such as with neuroblastoma or Wilms' tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Cyclic fever in which periods of fever lasting from 3 to 10 days are separated by an afebrile period of approximately the same length (Pel-Ebstein fever) can occur in children, but is uncommon. Persistent fever also may be the only complaint in children with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, leukemia, and Ewing sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. Approximately two-thirds of children with leukemia have fever at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The initial diagnostic evaluation for the child with a fever that does not respond to seemingly appropriate therapy should include (but is not limited to) a complete blood count with differential, examination of the peripheral blood smear, blood culture, and chest radiography. Additional studies may be indicated for fever of unknown origin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Overview of evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The white blood cell (WBC) differential and examination of the peripheral blood smear may help distinguish the underlying cause of fever. The presence of circulating blasts or profound neutropenia or thrombocytopenia can suggest the diagnosis of leukemia. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy can confirm or exclude malignant diseases involving the bone marrow. Chest radiography may reveal an intrathoracic mass. On the other hand, the presence of atypical lymphocytes, as seen in mononucleosis and other viral illnesses, can help to establish that the illness is not cancer.

However, patients with continued, unintentional weight loss in the setting of anemia, pallor, bruising, body pains, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, unexplained fevers, or fatigue may have an underlying malignancy. The evaluation of children with weight loss is discussed separately.

The size of normal lymph nodes in children varies widely as children are exposed to new viruses and bacteria. Most children have palpable, small cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes at some time during childhood. As a general rule, regardless of cause, a lymph node is considered enlarged if it is &gt;10 mm in its greatest diameter. Epitrochlear nodes, which are considered enlarged if they are &gt;5 mm, and inguinal nodes, which are considered enlarged if they are &gt;15 mm, are the exceptions to this general rule.</p><p>The causes of and diagnostic approach to lymphadenopathy in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-etiology#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral lymphadenopathy in children: Etiology&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnostic-approach#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral lymphadenopathy in children: Evaluation and diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Most enlarged nodes are related to benign causes such as infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, lymphadenopathy may be the presenting sign of leukemia, lymphoma, histiocytosis, neuroblastoma, and germ cell tumors; in contrast, lymphadenopathy is uncommon with soft tissue and bone tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/1,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24</a>]. The site of the adenopathy and the child's age may help narrow the range of possible diagnoses. The most common cancers associated with lymphadenopathy of the head and neck are neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia in children younger than six years, whereas lymphomas (both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's) predominate in children between 7 and 13 years of age; Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common histology in children older than 13 years.</p><p>The prevalence of malignancy in lymph node biopsies performed in pediatric referral centers ranges from 11 to 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In a typical primary care practice, however, the incidence is much lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The incidence of cancer in children who have lymphadenopathy is higher if certain clinical characteristics are present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constitutional symptoms (ie, fever, night sweats, or weight loss), although these can occur in both malignancy and infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to reactive lymph nodes, which are associated more often with tenderness, erythema, warmth, or fluctuance, cancerous nodes typically are firm, rubbery, matted, and nontender. They usually increase in size over the course of several examinations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenopathy in the posterior auricular, epitrochlear, or supraclavicular area is more concerning for malignancy than is adenopathy in other areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/3,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25</a>]. In particular, supraclavicular (or lower cervical) lymphadenopathy is associated with a high risk of malignancy (as much as 75 to 100 percent) in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. Right supraclavicular adenopathy can occur in conjunction with cancers involving the mediastinal lymph nodes. In contrast, left supraclavicular adenopathy (&quot;the Virchow's node&quot;) suggests intraabdominal malignancy, most often lymphoma. The differential diagnosis of epitrochlear lymphadenopathy includes infections of the forearm or hand, leukemia, lymphoma, and atypical mycobacterial infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any asymptomatic node that is larger than 2.5 cm warrants further investigation and early consideration for excisional biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The consistency of the lymph nodes is of limited help. Rock-hard nodes can be found in cancers that induce fibrotic (scirrhous) changes and when previous inflammation has resulted in fibrosis. Firm, rubbery nodes typically are found in lymphomas and chronic leukemia, whereas nodes in acute leukemia tend to be softer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal lymph nodes can become fixed to adjacent tissues or to each other (&quot;matted&quot;) by invading cancers, and less commonly by inflammation in tissue surrounding the nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When lymphadenopathy is unexplained after the initial evaluation, the subsequent work-up depends upon whether the adenopathy is localized or generalized.

The appearance of onion skin is caused by repetitive periosteal reactions, each depositing a layer of calcium, as the tumor grows beyond the periostium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61818\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61818 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

Although abnormal findings on either plain radiographs or bone scan can raise suspicion for malignancy, they do not obviate the need for obtaining a tissue biopsy, because no findings are pathognomonic for malignancy.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging method of choice for evaluation of bone and soft tissue lesions because it can demonstrate the extent of both medullary and soft tissue involvement, and it is the most sensitive means of detecting skip lesions (ie, medullary disease within the same bone, but not in direct contiguity with the primary lesion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

These features may help to determine how rapidly the mass is growing, or to distinguish malignancy from another more chronic illness.</p><p>Physical examination should characterize the location and extent of the abdominal mass. Palpation is easier if the child is relaxed. The following structures are normally palpable in children and sometimes are mistaken for abdominal masses: the liver edge, spleen, kidneys, aorta, sigmoid colon, and spine. Administration of an enema or bladder catheterization may be necessary before reexamination if the mass is thought to represent stool or a full bladder. These procedures should be undertaken only if the child has a normal absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Rectal, vaginal, and pelvic examinations may be warranted in adolescent females but also should be performed only if the ANC is normal, to avoid predisposing the neutropenic patient to bacteremia and sepsis.</p><p>After the history, examination, and routine laboratory studies (including a CBC, serum chemistries, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urinalysis) are obtained, the workup should proceed to abdominal ultrasound and chest radiograph.

Noninvasive imaging techniques such as CT, diagnostic ultrasonography, MRI, positron emission tomographic (PET) scans, and nuclear medicine scans have improved the assessment and staging for cancer. However, histologic confirmation (ie, tissue biopsy) is the only absolute means of definitive diagnosis.</p><p>Thus, once malignancy is suspected on the basis of clinical, laboratory, and imaging studies, selecting the most rapid and reliable means to establish the histologic diagnosis is necessary. The primary physician should confer with the pediatric oncologist, surgeon, and pathologist to determine the biopsy site, amount of tissue needed, and specimens to be obtained. Four general principles should be considered in these discussions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enough material must be obtained so that additional biopsies are not necessary</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The obtaining of biopsy material for diagnosis should not compromise future therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excisional biopsy is preferred when the malignancy involves an organ</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper timing and handling of the biopsy material is essential</p><p/><p>Incisional or core needle biopsies are the standard techniques for obtaining diagnostic tissue. Incisional biopsies are preferred by most pathologists, because they yield a greater amount of tissue with fewer artifactual distortions. However, they must be planned and performed carefully, and only after consultation with the surgeon and oncologist. This procedure is particularly important for the patient with a suspected extremity sarcoma, in whom a poorly planned or incorrectly performed biopsy can compromise the ability to perform a limb-sparing procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;, section on 'Tissue biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>A total excision may be recommended for suspicious lesions that are smaller than 4 cm and located superficially in the dermis or subcutaneous tissues. Larger masses or tumors in deeper locations require an incisional or core needle biopsy. As a general rule, if the mass appears to be localized to an organ such as the adrenal gland or the kidney, surgical exploration with attempted total resection is the usual approach, often in lieu of a biopsy, provided no evidence of metastatic disease is found.</p><p>Proper timing and handling of biopsy material is essential because the information obtained from them can affect treatment decisions and prognosis. Biopsy specimens should be placed in normal (0.9 percent) saline and then transported immediately on ice to the surgical pathology laboratory. Biopsy specimens should <strong>not</strong> be placed in formalin. Gross examination of the tissue by the pathologist before processing helps to ensure that the specimen is adequate. Intraoperative frozen sections may be necessary to ensure diagnostic material, particularly if an immediate diagnosis will alter a planned operation. Placement of a central venous catheter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> performance of a bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">aspirate/biopsy</span> may be performed at the time of biopsy, if such procedures are indicated by the operative findings.
