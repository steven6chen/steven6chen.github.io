(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation#H351537719\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic primary mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Indications for mitral valve intervention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation#H1432708687\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>Two surgical mitral valve procedures are available for the treatment of chronic MR: valve repair and valve replacement. The choice of procedure depends, at least in part, upon the cause of the MR, the anatomy of the mitral valve, and the functional status of the left ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Valve repair versus valve replacement'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective way of stratifying operative risk is by using one of the available validated risk stratification models. As noted above, a variety of factors affect the risk of mortality after aortic valve replacement. The risk models are helpful in the evaluation and counseling of individual patients and planning perioperative care. Models have been developed to estimate risk of in-hospital mortality and complications following mitral or aortic valve surgery with or without coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). These are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estimating the mortality risk of valvular surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for coronary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with nonischemic chronic MR requiring surgery also have significant coronary artery disease. The prevalence of coronary disease in patients with degenerative mitral valve <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/prolapse</span> (the most common cause of nonischemic MR) was evaluated in a study in which routine coronary angiography was performed before surgery in 722 patients (67 percent men, mean age 61 years) who did not have a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic electrocardiographic changes, or angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Obstructive (&ge;50 percent) coronary lesions in one or more major vessels were present in 19 percent of patients.</p><p>Obstructive coronary lesions are usually revascularized at the time of mitral valve surgery; concurrent bypass surgery typically adds little morbidity or mortality to the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A separate issue, which is discussed elsewhere, is the management of ischemic MR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease included recommendations for the use of coronary angiography to establish the presence or absence of coronary disease prior to valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Assuming that the patient is not hemodynamically unstable, coronary angiography was recommended prior to valve intervention in patients who have or are suspected to have coronary disease and in those with coronary risk factors. Individuals with coronary risk factors include men &gt;40 years of age and postmenopausal women. Based upon these recommendations, many patients without significant coronary disease will undergo coronary angiography. Better methods are needed to identify patients at low risk.</p><p>A possible alternative is noninvasive coronary angiography, which may be accomplished using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. The potential utility of these tests as an alternative to conventional selective coronary angiography is discussed separately. Further study is required before this approach can be recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive coronary imaging with cardiac computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">VALVE REPAIR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Valve repair outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral valve repair procedures, called mitral valvuloplasties, are usually preferred for the surgical treatment of MR. Current mitral valve repair techniques, with use of adjunctive artificial chord replacement and ring annuloplasty (with ring prosthesis such as Carpentier Edwards or Duran ring), have significantly expanded the scope and durability of repair, especially in patients with bileaflet and anterior leaflet prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The following discussion is related to valve repair for primary MR (degenerative disease, prolapse, and flail leaflet). The outcomes after mitral valve repair for secondary (functional or ischemic) MR are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation#H662894426\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Mitral valve repair versus replacement'</a>.)</p><p>Mitral valve repair for degenerative MR has two major benefits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It preserves all functional components of the native valve; as a result, repair is associated with better postoperative ventricular function than seen with valve replacement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It avoids the use of a prosthetic heart valve with its attendant complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Patient outcomes after mitral valve repair are excellent when performed at experienced centers. In a review from the Cleveland Clinic of 1072 patients who underwent mitral valve repair for MR due to degenerative disease, the in-hospital mortality was 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the Mayo series of 1173 patients undergoing mitral valve repair for mitral valve prolapse from 1980 to 1999, 30-day mortality was 0.7 percent, five-year mortality was 11.3 percent and 10-year mortality was 29.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The 5- and 10-year mortality rates were similar to the expected mortality rates in a normal age-matched population (13.5 percent and 28.4 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent MR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent MR, which may require reoperation, is a potential limitation of mitral valve repair. However, with current techniques, in experienced centers, the rate of freedom from reoperation after mitral valve repair is similar to that after mitral valve replacement. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Valve repair versus valve replacement'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency of recurrent MR and reoperation, in patients with primary MR, are illustrated by the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review from Leuven, Belgium of 242 patients, the prevalence of moderate-severe to severe (3+ to 4+) MR at one month, five years, and seven years was 2, 17, and 29 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] The prevalence of at least moderate (2+ to 4+) MR at one month, five years, and seven years was 6, 41, and 73 percent. Surgical techniques associated with a greater risk of recurrent MR included lack of use of an annuloplasty ring, the use of chordal shortening instead of artificial chordae or transposition, and lack of use of a sliding plasty for posterior annulus dilatation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review from Toronto of 701 patients, freedom from recurrent moderate or severe MR at 12 years was significantly higher with posterior compared with bileaflet or anterior prolapse (80 versus 67 and 65 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The rate of reoperation at 12 years was highest with anterior prolapse (12 versus 4 and 6 percent with posterior and bileaflet prolapse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Cleveland Clinic experience, freedom from reoperation after 10 years was 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Reoperation for late mitral valve dysfunction was due to progressive degenerative disease in one-half of these cases. Repair durability was greatest in patients with isolated posterior leaflet prolapse who had posterior leaflet resection and annuloplasty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Mayo Clinic experience, the risk of reoperation after mitral valve repair was lower in the second decade of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For patients undergoing surgery during the 1990s, the linearized risk of reoperation was lowest for isolated posterior leaflet repair (0.50 percent per year), intermediate for bileaflet repair (0.92 percent per year), and highest for anterior leaflet repair (1.64 percent per year), although these rates were not statistically different.</p><p/><p>The improvement in durability of anterior leaflet repair in the Mayo experience was attributed to changes in technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the 1980s at the Mayo Clinic, anterior leaflet prolapse was corrected by chordal shortening, chordal transfer, or commissural annuloplasty. In the 1990s, anterior leaflet repair was performed by posterior annuloplasty or insertion of polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) neochordae, or limited triangular resection. In the Toronto experience, use of neochordae since the 1990s was cited as the single most important factor in making mitral valve repair feasible in most patients with MR with degenerative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography is recommended since it can enhance the success of valve repair and can reliably predict early and late mitral valve dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1,2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of mitral valve disease&quot;, section on 'Role of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an adverse prognostic factor in patients with MR and is associated with worse long-term outcomes after mitral valve repair for degenerative MR. Patients with AF tend to be older and are more likely to have left ventricular dysfunction.</p><p>There are conflicting data as to whether AF is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] or is not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] an independent predictor of survival after mitral valve repair. However, patients with AF are at increased risk for mortality due to cardioembolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. AF is unlikely to resolve after valve repair alone; as a result, a concurrent AF ablation procedure may be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methods for percutaneous mitral valve repair to treat MR are under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The possible role of percutaneous mitral valve repair in chronic ischemic MR is discussed separately.

The following illustrative findings were reported from a cohort of 47,279 patients aged 65 years or older who underwent primary isolated mitral valve surgery between 2000 and 2009 with a median follow-up of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative mortality was 3.9 percent for patients who had mitral valve repair compared with 8.9 percent in those who had mitral valve replacement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-, five-, and 10-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were greater among those who underwent mitral valve repair (91, 77, and 54 percent versus 83, 65, and 37 percent, respectively, for mitral valve replacement).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The one-, five-, and 10-year survival benefits with mitral valve repair were also seen in those aged 75 years or greater (88, 71, and 40 percent survival with repair versus 80, 60, and 28 percent survival with replacement). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvular heart disease in elderly adults&quot;, section on 'Mitral valve repair'</a>.)</p><p/><p>By contrast, among patients with ischemic MR (a type of secondary MR), survival is similar following mitral valve replacement with chordal sparing and mitral valve repair. However, recurrent MR is much more frequent following mitral valve repair. A randomized trial found that mitral valve repair resulted in a significantly higher rate of cardiovascular admission and a borderline significantly higher rate of heart failure-related adverse events, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation#H662894426\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Mitral valve repair versus replacement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Reoperation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term rates of reoperation (not simply recurrent MR) appear to be similar with valve repair and valve replacement.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Emory experience of patients undergoing surgery between 1984 and 1997, the rate of reoperation for mitral valve replacement at five years was 6 percent for patients who had undergone mitral valve repair and 4 percent for those who had undergone mitral valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, at the end of 10 years, rate of reoperation was lower in the mitral repair patients (22 percent) compared with mitral replacement patients (34 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower rates of reoperation were noted in a cohort of patient undergoing mitral valve surgery during a slightly later time period. In the Mayo experience for initial repairs in the 1990s, the linearized risk of reoperation after repair of the posterior leaflet (0.5 percent per year) compared favorably to the risk of reoperation after mechanical valve replacement (0.7 percent per year) and all mitral valve replacements (0.7 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The risk of reoperation following bilateral and anterior leaflet repair were higher (0.92 and 1.64 percent per year), although not statistically different.</p><p/><p>The lower rates of reoperation following mitral valve repair in later series probably reflect the use of more effective anterior leaflet prolapse repair techniques (such as PTFE chordal replacement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>] (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent MR'</a> above). Other possible explanations for the improvement include other technical advances, greater experience, and earlier patient referral.</p><p>Based upon such observations, both the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> guidelines and the 2012 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) valve guidelines concluded that mitral valve repair is preferred in the majority of patients with chronic primary MR and should be performed at centers experienced in this procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86954\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86954 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98397 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

In contrast, transesophageal echocardiography is essential in the operating room to better define the anatomy, ensure an adequate repair, and confirm the absence of complications after repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction are at increased risk of mortality from mitral valve surgery, both in terms of perioperative and long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Data comparing valve repair with valve replacement in patients with left ventricular dysfunction are limited. Mitral valve repair has been preferred to replacement in this setting because of the comparable or better survival figures, despite the frequent persistence or recurrence of MR. The data supporting this approach are discussed elsewhere. When valve replacement is required, it is important to preserve the chordal mechanism to preserve or improve left ventricular function and geometry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation#H3040841906\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'When to perform mitral valve surgery for secondary MR'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">VALVE REPLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several issues that must be addressed when valve replacement is considered.

The major problems associated with mechanical valves are thromboembolism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding from the chronic anticoagulation required to prevent thromboembolism. A most important problem with bioprosthetic valves is limited durability due to valve degeneration, particularly among those &lt;65 years old. These issues are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of prosthetic heart valve for surgical aortic or mitral valve replacement&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Chordal preservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valve replacement with excision of the subvalvular apparatus is necessary when there is severe leaflet disease with subvalvular scarring and calcification. This procedure generally has a negative impact on left ventricular function, as shown in both experimental animals and humans; it may be due in part to severing of the chordae tendineae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p>If possible, valve replacement with preservation of the subvalvular apparatus is preferred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79932\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79932 \">figure 2</a>). This procedure provides a competent valve, preserves the functional components of the subvalvular apparatus, improves left ventricular (LV) geometry and long-term function, and produces a better clinical outcome than valve replacement alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. In a comparative study, for example, the LV ejection fraction (EF) decreased from 60 percent preoperatively to 36 percent postoperatively in seven patients who had had chordal transection; by comparison, the preoperative and postoperative ejection fractions were similar (63 and 61 percent) in the eight patients who had chordal preservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The authors attributed the improved results with chordal preservation to a smaller LV size that results in lower systolic wall stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. Preservation of LV long axis shortening and an ellipsoid (versus spherical) LV shape may also contribute to more effective LV systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This can be particularly important in patients with decompensated MR, in whom attempts should be made to avoid or minimize a postoperative decline in ventricular function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Prosthetic valve-patient mismatch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normalization of pulmonary artery pressure is a goal of mitral valve replacement since even mild pulmonary hypertension can impair exercise capacity and may increase morbidity and mortality. However, the effective orifice area index (EOAI) in prosthetic valves used for mitral valve replacement is often small in relation to body size and may be associated with transvalvular pressure gradients similar to those in mild to moderate mitral stenosis. Thus, prosthetic-patient mismatch (PPM) may contribute to persistent postoperative pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>An association between PPM and reduced postoperative survival was reported by two single-center retrospective studies from Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]; in contrast, a third study found no relationship between PPM and survival:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Quebec study of 929 patients who underwent mitral valve replacement, the EOAI was used to define PPM as severe when &le;0.9 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup></span> (9 percent), moderate (69 percent of patients) when &gt;0.9 and &le;1.2 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> and nonsignificant when &gt;1.2 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup></span> (22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients with severe PPM had 6- and 12-year survivals that were lower than those for patients with moderate or nonsignificant PPM (74 versus 84 and 90 percent at six years, and 63 versus 76 and 82 percent at 12 years). PPM was associated with higher pulmonary artery pressures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Ottawa study of 884 patients who underwent mitral valve replacement, PPM, defined as an EOAI of &le;1.25 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> was present in 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Survival for patients with PPM was significantly lower compared with those without PPM at all-time points ranging from 91 versus 95 percent at one year to 65 versus 75 percent at 10 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, a study from Vancouver found no association between PPM and overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Among 2440 patients who had undergone mitral valve replacement, 14 percent had no PPM, 70 percent had moderate PPM, and 16 percent had severe PPM (categories defined as in the Quebec study). Survival to 15 years was not significantly different among patients with no, moderate, or severe PPM. The EOAI was an independent predictor of early mortality but not of late or overall mortality. There was interaction between EOAI and pulmonary hypertension (which was an independent predictor of overall mortality).</p><p/><p>Limitations of these studies included absence of separate results for patients with either MR or stenosis and inclusion of patients who might have undergone mitral valve repair using current practice standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. There were large differences in the frequency of PPM (78 percent, 32, and 86 percent) in the three studies, which may have been partly due to the lower proportion of smaller prostheses in the Ottawa study as well as differing normal reference values for EOA in the Ottawa study.</p><p>In addition, it is not clear that the association between PPM and pulmonary hypertension is causal. Patients requiring smaller prosthetic valve sizes (eg, &lt;27 mm) frequently have heavily calcified mitral annuli and longstanding mitral disease likely to predispose to persistent pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, PPM may reflect patient specific risk factors rather than a prosthetic valve problem.</p><p>Despite these limitations, evidence that PPM is associated with residual pulmonary hypertension and increased mortality provides a rationale for implanting a mitral valve prosthesis with largest EOA for a given annulus size; the inability to completely avoid PPM provides further support for the strategy of repairing rather than replacing the valve, when possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>].
