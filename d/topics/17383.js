In addition, there are lingual tonsils on the posterior tongue and tubal tonsils just posterior to the Eustachian tube opening. Waldeyer's ring is the ring of these four lymphoid tissues in the pharynx formed by the palatine tonsils (&quot;tonsils&quot;), pharyngeal tonsils (&quot;adenoids&quot;), tubal tonsils, and lingual tonsils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75111%7EPC%2F65825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75111 graphicRef65825 \">figure 1A-B</a>). </p><p>The tonsils are positioned laterally in the pharyngeal wall between the palatoglossal arch and palatopharyngeal arch (the anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars), which merge superiorly to become the soft palate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72358\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72358 \">figure 2</a>). Each tonsil is contained within its own fascia. A potential space between the tonsil and the pharyngeal constrictor muscle can accumulate pus and become a peritonsillar abscess. The tonsil is innervated by branches from the glossopharyngeal nerve. Lymphatic drainage includes the upper jugular and jugulo-diagastric lymph nodes.</p><p>The tonsillar vascular supply is from branches of the external carotid artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78639\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78639 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior pole: Descending palatine artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mid-fossa: Ascending pharyngeal artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inferior pole: Tonsillar branch of the lingual artery and ascending palatine branch of the facial artery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15449409\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for a tonsillectomy in adults are reviewed elsewhere.

In higher-risk patients with severe obstruction or a need to rule out malignancy as an indication for tonsillectomy (eg, unknown primary), the risks of anesthesia need to be weighed against any benefit derived from the procedure. Biopsy is an alternative approach and can potentially be performed in the clinic.

If the clinical history suggests that a bleeding diathesis is or may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 1</a>), laboratory evaluation is indicated.

In general, antiplatelet agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) should be avoided for one week prior to surgery. For patients who take these drugs chronically, the risks and benefits of cessation of therapy versus perioperative bleeding need to be weighed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Perioperative administration of nonsteroidal analgesic medication may increase the risk of postoperative hemorrhage. A retrospective review of 10 studies found that adults receiving intravenous administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> had a fivefold increased risk of hemorrhage compared with patients not administered ketorolac [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Tonsillectomy can be performed in adult patients who are on anticoagulants (eg, vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin) with proper bridging strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The surgeon should evaluate patients for severe trismus, which can limit operative exposure and cervical spine instability, since this is a risk factor for neurologic symptoms postoperatively. Patients at high risk, such as those with Down syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis, should have spine films to screen for cervical spine abnormalities. If needed, evaluation and clearance by a spine specialist should be undertaken prior to proceeding with surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-subluxation-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical subluxation in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage due to an aberrant carotid artery is a rare and potentially catastrophic complication.

Given that tonsillar bed infections following tonsillectomy are exceedingly rare, it would be difficult to perform an adequately powered trial to determine the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics for preventing infection at the tonsillectomy site.</p><p>However, head and neck surgeons agree that antimicrobial prophylaxis should be used for head and neck surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. However, the optimal antimicrobial coverage (specifically whether or not to cover gram-negative organisms) is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In general, the inherent risk for infection in head and neck surgery is related to the bacterial load of oral flora (typically 100,000,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/mL)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81076\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81076 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. A <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitor</span> combination such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/sulbactam</span> provides adequate coverage of these organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> or clindamycin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> are good alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients.</p><p>Indirect evidence is available. A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials of prophylactic antibiotics for surgery for head and neck cancer revealed a relative difference in infection rates of 43.7 percent in favor of the use of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, this analysis (like most trials evaluating antibiotics for head and neck surgery) used skin incision infection rates as the primary outcome, and some of these operations did not involve incision of the mucosa.</p><p>Following tonsillectomy, some surgeons continue antibiotics into the perioperative period in select patients (eg, chronic infection); however, postoperative antibiotics are generally unnecessary for most patients. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative antibiotics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. The patient must be intubated in order to protect the airway and prevent aspiration of secretions or blood. Most surgeons prefer an endotracheal tube (eg, oral-RAE Tracheal tube) positioned in the midline and bent inferiorly to allow the tube to be positioned over the tongue, lower lip, and toward the chin. The endotracheal tube is secured with tape, and a mouth gag (eg, Crowe-Davis, McIvor) is placed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57172 \">figure 4</a>). The mouth gag holds the mouth open during retraction of the tongue and endotracheal tube. The surgeon and the anesthesiologist share the same region of the patient's anatomy for airway maintenance and surgical field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, the surgeon must take care to prevent kinking of the endotracheal tube or accidental extubation during manipulation of the mouth gag.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Measures to prevent complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The local complications of tonsillectomy are prevented with vigilance during prepping, draping, and intraoperative manipulation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the sterile drapes to expose the intraoral and pharyngeal structures without injuring the eyes or face. Globe injury has been reported with the use of penetrating towel clips around the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid damage to teeth (ie, chipped or dislodged) during either airway placement or with manipulation of surgical instruments in the mouth. Obtain a chest radiograph if there is any suspicion that a tooth or a portion of tooth is missing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid temporomandibular joint dislocation by limiting the extent to which the jaw is opened by the mouth gag during the procedure. Once the mouth gag is removed, the surgeon should palpate the joint and check dental occlusion. A depression noted in the preauricular area indicates that the mandibular condyle is trapped in front of the articular eminence. The most common sign of this problem postoperatively is an inability to close the mouth or malocclusion. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79109%7EEM%2F59637\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79109 graphicRef59637 \">figure 5A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporomandibular-joint-tmj-dislocation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid excessive hyperextension of the neck during intubation and the procedure. If there is concern for cervical instability, maintain the neck in a neutral position during the operative procedure to decrease the potential for atlantoaxial subluxation. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Tonsillectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus as to a standard tonsillectomy technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The instruments used are either cold (knife), hot (diathermy), or a combination of the two. Well-designed randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal method for tonsillectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a variety of instrumentation and techniques that are used to perform a tonsillectomy. Tissue temperatures and collateral thermal tissue injury vary greatly by instrumentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The superiority of one instrument type over another has not been clearly demonstrated. There are insufficient data from randomized trials to determine whether any technique is superior with respect to incidence of postoperative hemorrhage. The choice of instrumentation affects the risk and timing of postoperative bleeding. As an example, according to a 2017 Cochrane review of both adult and pediatric studies, Coblation was associated with less pain than other tonsillectomy techniques on postoperative days 1 and 3, but not on postoperative day 7. The primary bleeding risk was similar, but Coblation had a slightly higher risk of secondary bleeding (risk ratio 1.36, 95% CI 0.95-1.95) based on low quality of evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It should be noted, however, that with mixed techniques (cold dissection and diathermy for hemostasis), the risk of postoperative hemorrhage becomes greater as diathermy power increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Major bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>Cold dissection is performed with a tonsil knife and tonsil dissector (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56667\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56667 \">figure 6</a>). Electrodissection can be performed using a needle tip or spatula tip (monopolar) or <span class=\"nowrap\">forceps/scissors</span> (bipolar). Tissue temperatures up to 600&ordm;C are attained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A suction cautery can also be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Coblation refers to a form of diathermy introduced for tonsillectomy in the 1990s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59293\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef59293 \">movie 1</a>). Radiofrequency (low-energy) waves pass from the Coblation wand through saline to produce a plasma field with lower tissue temperatures (&lt;70&ordm;C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The energy breaks organic molecular bonds, resulting in tissue disintegration. Coblation is purported to accurately reduce the volume of target tissue with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. </p><p>The Microdebrider instrument is often used to perform a subtotal tonsillectomy; however, this procedure is rarely performed in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two types of tonsillectomy techniques:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete or total tonsillectomy &ndash; A complete or total tonsillectomy removes the entire tonsil and is the most commonly performed procedure for adults. The tonsillectomy procedure begins with the patient being placed in a supine position and provided general anesthesia with intubation. The mouth gag retractor is placed on the tongue and positioned on the upper teeth. The retractor is opened to allow the mouth to be held open, with the tongue retracted inferiorly. The mouth gag is then suspended off the Mayo stand or a tonsil suspension device. In the complete tonsillectomy technique, an Allis clamp is used to grasp the upper portion of the tonsil (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59293\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef59293 \">movie 1</a>). As it is pulled anteriorly and medially, the anterior tonsillar pillar mucosa is divided superiorly to inferiorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50984\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50984 \">figure 7</a>). As the mucosa is divided, the plane between the tonsil capsule and the tonsil fossa (pharyngeal constrictors) can be identified. With the superior pole of the tonsil freed, the Allis clamp can be repositioned as needed to grasp the inferior tonsil, and the tonsil is dissected out of its bed. Care is taken to control (tie or cauterize) the perforating vessels as they are encountered. The dissection is carried out ideally in a plane superficial to the muscle layer; however, scar and infection often make finding this dissection plane especially difficult in adults compared with children. Electrocautery or suture ligation will usually control bleeding. Once the tonsil is released from the tonsillar fossa, the inferior mucosa is divided and the tonsil removed. Care must be taken not to enter into the base of the tongue, where bleeding may be difficult to visualize for hemostasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subtotal tonsillectomy &ndash; A partial, rather than a complete, tonsillectomy can also be performed. A partial or intracapsular tonsillectomy is associated with regrowth of the tonsil remnant, may cause hypertrophy or recurrent infections, and therefore is infrequently performed in adults with recurrent tonsillar infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/17,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22,23</a>]. A partial tonsillectomy is typically performed to treat tonsillar hypertrophy for pediatric patients with sleep apnea. Regrowth of the tonsillar tissue is possible with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This technique is not commonly used in adults. Subtotal tonsillectomy (ie, tonsillotomy, partial tonsillectomy, and intracapsular tonsillectomy) involves removing most of the tonsil. Studies that compared tonsillectomy with subtotal tonsillectomy report less postoperative pain with the subtotal approach, but this approach takes longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Guillotine tonsillectomy is a cold technique of predominantly historic significance that was performed in the clinic setting on an awake patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A special instrument with a loop of wire was placed over the tonsil. The wire was then tightened, then pulled through the tonsil to amputate it from the tonsillar fossa. While the path of least resistance for the wire should be through the anatomic plane between the capsule of the tonsil and the pharyngeal muscles, chronically infected tonsils have severe scarring, limiting the usefulness of this procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Same-day surgery appears to be safe for the majority of otherwise healthy patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Postoperative admission is indicated for the following patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with elevated cardiac risk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding diathesis, specifically patients with sickle cell anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive sleep apnea as the indication for tonsillectomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital disorders such as Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, and mental retardation because of their higher risk of cervical spine and respiratory complications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative dietary recommendations vary. Many clinicians advocate a soft diet for up to two weeks since hard foods might irritate the surgical site and induce bleeding. Acidic foods (citrus, tomato) may cause pain. Optimal food temperature is purely a patient preference.</p><p>Drinking plenty of liquids in the first 72 hours is important to prevent dehydration; keeping the area moist also reduces pain. Analgesics should be taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals to reduce pain from swallowing; otherwise, decreased oral intake can lead to hypovolemia. Up to 5 percent of post-tonsillectomy patients are seen in the emergency room visits for issues relating to hypovolemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients can resume light activities within two weeks but should avoid activities that increase central pressure (eg, heavy lifting, straining, strenuous exercise) for two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. After this period of time, the likelihood of bleeding is minimal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative antibiotic therapy is unnecessary. A meta-analysis on antibiotics to reduce post-tonsillectomy morbidity concluded there was little or no evidence that antibiotics reduce the main morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy (pain, need for analgesia, hemorrhage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. They appeared to reduce fever (relative risk [RR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.85), but methodological shortcomings in the included trials may have produced a bias.

Ear pain also may occur; it is &quot;referred&quot; pain from the glossopharyngeal nerve (which innervates the pharyngeal muscles); anecdotally, ear pain may be relieved by chewing gum.</p><p>We recommend appropriate use of liquid analgesics for pain in the first week postoperatively. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is helpful for relieving pain, but controversial regarding bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/17,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,28</a>]. A meta-analysis of randomized trials found that use of NSAIDS in children post-tonsillectomy did not increase bleeding requiring surgical intervention, but the effect on minor bleeding was not evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, these data should not be generalized to adult patients since bleeding after tonsillectomy is more common in adults. In the United States, NSAIDs are usually avoided because of concern about bleeding; however, NSAIDs are routinely prescribed in Europe because, at least in children, they can significantly reduce nausea, vomiting, and narcotic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>For adult patients with severe pain, codeine-based medication can be used on a limited basis.

It can also help with reducing swelling in the oropharynx or soft palate. The use of NSAIDs as part of a pain regimen was shown to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A later trial compared a postoperative course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> to no prednisolone following tonsillectomy in patients four or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

After the surgery, the tonsillar fossa develops a thick white patch (eschar) as it is healing. The eschar usually falls off after six to nine days, which may be associated with mild bleeding. Some experts feel the postoperative bleeding risks may be reduced by keeping a soft diet, reduced activity, and avoiding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (or similar products).</p><p>Minor bleeding (no more than specks of blood in the saliva) is usually managed conservatively. Patients can be instructed to gargle with cold water. The patient should seek medical attention for persistent bleeding, coughing (sign of blood being aspirated), or vomiting blood clots.</p><p>In the clinic or emergency department setting, the application of pressure to the tonsillar fossa with a tonsil gauze may stop the bleeding. If this fails, the tonsillar fossa can be injected with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a></span> mixture (1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine). Cauterization with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a> can be performed in a procedure room with appropriate equipment and lighting, provided the patient does not have an excessive gag reflex.

Drinking plenty of liquids in the first 72 hours is important to prevent hypovolemia and limit pain.</p><p>Large amounts of bright red blood from the mouth or nose should be reported to the clinician immediately or the patient should be instructed to be seen in the emergency department. High fever, persistent nausea and vomiting (or blood in the vomit), persistent coughing, inability to take fluids or excessive weakness, severe pain not relieved by prescribed pain medicines, or shortness of breath are also reasons to seek medical attention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Return to work</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are often instructed that they may return to work two to three weeks following tonsillectomy; however, this varies from one to three weeks depending on the individual's postoperative course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main procedure-specific complications following tonsillectomy are bleeding, pulmonary-related complications, and tonsillar bed infection.</p><p>The indications for and technique used for performing tonsillectomy may have implications for the incidence and type of morbidity, primarily pain and bleeding. As an example, the removal of chronically scarred tonsils can be more difficult owing to the lack of a distinct dissection plane, which may be the reason that the overall hemorrhage rate for tonsillectomy is greater in adults than in children (4.5 versus 2.6 percent in one study), who typically do not have scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Cold instrument techniques have been associated with more intraoperative blood loss and less pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], while hot techniques may result in more secondary bleeding. Combined techniques (eg, cold dissection plus hot techniques for hemostasis) have intermediate rates for these morbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, it should be noted that the risk of postoperative hemorrhage becomes greater as diathermy power increases with mixed techniques (ie, cold dissection and <strong>bipolar</strong> diathermy for hemostasis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Tonsillectomy'</a> above.)</p><p>The impact on health care expenditure from complications of tonsillectomy was reported in a cohort study of 36,210 adult patients who underwent tonsillectomy. Postoperative emergency department visits and hospitalizations as well as total per capita costs were analyzed. Ten percent of patients visited the emergency department, and 1.5 percent were admitted within 14 days of tonsillectomy, with 6 percent treated for hemorrhage (one-half requiring return to the operating room), 2 percent for dehydration, and 11 percent for pain. The cost for uncomplicated tonsillectomy was $3832, $6388 for hemorrhage, $5753 for dehydration, and $4708 for pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Major bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative bleeding can be severe, even lethal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Hemorrhage sufficient to require specific treatment has been reported in up to 6 percent of cases following tonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/31,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35-37</a>]. Up to 50 percent of patients who bleed require control of oropharyngeal bleeding in the operating room. Multiple bleeding episodes are common among those who bleed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>] and can herald a more significant life-threatening hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Patients with a negative history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> normal coagulation studies preoperatively who experience bilateral diffuse tonsillar bleeding may warrant further coagulation evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Primary hemorrhage occurs most commonly within six hours of surgery, with a mean of 5.3 hours in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. It is often severe and is more likely to require a return to the operating room than secondary hemorrhage. Secondary hemorrhage is most likely to occur between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> postoperative day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/32,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,37</a>]. This is the time period when the tonsillar bed eschar separates, exposing small surface vessels to local trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In one study using mixed tonsillectomy techniques, hemorrhage occurred in 389 of 11,796 patients (3.3 percent of procedures); hemorrhage was primary in 0.5 percent and secondary in 2.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. When &quot;cold&quot; techniques are used alone, primary hemorrhage occurs more frequently than secondary hemorrhage, but the overall rate of hemorrhage is reduced compared with use of mixed or primarily hot techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/18,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,36</a>]. Excessive use of &quot;hot&quot; techniques may cause more thermal damage and a larger area of eschar that is more prone to secondary bleeding when it sloughs. </p><p>However, the risk of hemorrhage is associated with the extensiveness of the procedure. In a prospective, multicenter cohort study with 9405 adult and pediatric patients, the overall risk of hemorrhage (minor and severe) was 7.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Delivery of anesthesia to a patient with post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage is hazardous, and early intubation for airway protection should be considered in the patient with significant postoperative bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Electrocautery (monopolar, bipolar, or suction cautery), chemical cautery (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a>), or suture ligation will usually control oropharyngeal bleeding. Persistent oozing from the tonsillar bed(s) can be controlled by suturing the tonsillar pillars together, which helps to tamponade surface bleeding.</p><p>Uncontrolled bleeding due to arterial injury requires a more aggressive approach (see <a href=\"#H39943061\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above). In the extremely rare event that bleeding cannot be controlled transorally, the oropharynx is packed and the patient prepared for either angiographic embolization or external carotid artery ligation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative respiratory compromise can occur for several reasons.

The sudden relief of respiratory obstruction from the enlarged tonsils results in loss of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This can lead to transudation of fluid into the interstitial and alveolar spaces and respiratory compromise.

Reduced nasal resonance resulting in improved voice and speech quality following removal of large tonsils is more usual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, unwanted postoperative hypernasality may be caused by velopharyngeal incompetence, which can be a serious problem. Hypernasality usually resolves spontaneously, but if it persists for eight weeks, then speech therapy is recommended, and surgery may be indicated if the vocal disturbance persists for 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>An inability to close the mouth postoperatively or the presence of malocclusion is a sign of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation. If this is identified intraoperatively, the joint is reduced while still under anesthesia.
