In experimental animal models, the time from inoculation to microscopically detectable parasitemia was approximately 15 days, with a peak at 20 to 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Most patients have nonspecific symptoms (such as malaise, fever, and anorexia) or are asymptomatic so do not come to clinical attention during the acute phase.</p><p>In a minority of patients, acute infection may be associated with inflammation and swelling at the site of inoculation, known as a chagoma. Chagomas typically occur on the face or extremities; in some cases, parasites can be demonstrated in the lesion. Inoculation via the conjunctiva may lead to a characteristic unilateral swelling of the upper and lower eyelid known as Roma&ntilde;a's sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58601\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58601 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Severe acute disease occurs in less than 1 percent of patients; manifestations may include acute myocarditis, pericardial effusion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meningoencephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Severe acute Chagas disease carries a substantial risk of mortality.

In addition, arrangements should be made for maternal evaluation and treatment after completion of lactation. Screening should also be pursued for the infected woman's other children (if any). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-chronic-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For the first several months of life, congenital <em>T. cruzi</em> infection is an acute phase infection, and thus demonstration of the parasite (or its DNA or antigen) forms the basis for diagnosis. Diagnosis is complicated by the fact that immunoglobulin (Ig)G serology in an infant reflects maternal antibody for up to nine months after birth.</p><p>The technique traditionally used to diagnose congenital <em>T. cruzi</em> infection is the micromethod (or microhematocrit method) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection/abstract/20,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26,27</a>]. This technique consists of centrifugation of fresh cord or neonatal blood sealed in four to six heparinized microhematocrit tubes (12,000 rpm for seven minutes), followed by light microscopic examination of the buffy coat layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the sensitivity of examination of a single infant specimen by this technique is less than 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection/abstract/17,18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,28</a>]; repeated sampling may increase the sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection/abstract/17,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29</a>].</p><p>Molecular techniques have substantially higher sensitivity compared with the micromethod, estimated at 65 to 70 percent in a single specimen and 85 percent when performed in multiple specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection/abstract/17,18,28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,28,30,31</a>]. Several investigators have reported transient detection of low quantities of <em>T. cruzi</em> DNA in very early specimens from infants later confirmed to be uninfected; some researchers therefore require positive results in more than one specimen or by more than one technique for confirmation of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection/abstract/22,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32</a>].

The incubation period following vector-borne exposure is one to two weeks, after which the acute phase of Chagas disease begins. In transfusion- and transplant-associated cases, the incubation period may be as long as four months. (See <a href=\"#H154112846\" class=\"local\">'Transmission routes and risk groups'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2177685264\" class=\"local\">'Acute T. cruzi infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with acute <em>T. cruzi</em> infection have nonspecific symptoms (such as malaise, fever, and anorexia) or are asymptomatic, so do not come to clinical attention. In a minority of patients, acute infection may be associated with inflammation and swelling at the site of inoculation; when the inoculation site is the conjunctiva, the patient may develop characteristic painless swelling of the eyelids, known as Roma&ntilde;a's sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58601\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58601 \">picture 2</a>). Severe acute disease occurs in less than 1 percent of patients; manifestations may include acute myocarditis, pericardial effusion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meningoencephalitis. (See <a href=\"#H2223249627\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute Chagas disease should be suspected in individuals who live or have recently spent significant periods of time in areas of Latin America with vector-borne transmission, especially those who lived in houses with adobe walls <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thatched roofs. However, <em>T. cruzi</em> infection is rarely detected during the acute phase. (See <a href=\"#H3331542074\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In acute <em>T. cruzi</em> infection, the level of parasitemia is high; motile trypomastigotes can be detected by microscopy of fresh preparations of anticoagulated blood or buffy coat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60060\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60060 \">picture 1</a>). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays generally demonstrate positive results days to weeks before circulating trypomastigotes are detectable on peripheral blood smears. (See <a href=\"#H3331542074\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most congenital Chagas infections are asymptomatic or cause nonspecific signs. Low birthweight (&lt;2500 g), anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly are significantly more frequent among infants with congenital Chagas infection than uninfected infants. In a small proportion of patients, congenital infection causes severe morbidity, including meningoencephalitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H1429232944\" class=\"local\">'Congenital Chagas disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital Chagas infection should be suspected in children born to women who have lived or spent significant periods of time in areas of Latin America with vector-borne transmission. Polymerase chain reaction is used increasingly for early diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease in Latin American cities and is the method of choice in industrialized countries. The traditional technique for diagnosis of congenital <em>T. cruzi</em> infection consists of microscopic examination of the buffy coat layer of fresh cord or neonatal blood following centrifugation. For infants not diagnosed at birth, conventional immunoglobulin (Ig)G serology is recommended after nine months of age, when transferred maternal antibody has disappeared. (See <a href=\"#H4016323853\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antitrypanosomal therapy for all patients with acute or congenital <em>T. cruzi</em> infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65745 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Antitrypansomal drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benznidazole-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benznidazole</a> and nifurtimox; in general, benznidazole is better tolerated so is favored as the first-line treatment for Chagas disease. Dosing and adverse effects are outlined in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54443 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67193\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67193 \">table 3</a>).
