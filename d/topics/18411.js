Stenting represented an advance over percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) alone because acute procedural success was higher and the rate of restenosis requiring target lesion revascularization was much lower. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients required clinically-driven repeat target lesion revascularization within the first year after PTCA alone compared to 10 to 15 percent with bare-metal stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Drug-eluting stents (DES) represented a further advance in PCI and are now used in the majority of procedures. In addition, newer generation DES are used in preference to first generation DES.

The concept that complete revascularization (CR) leads to better outcomes than incomplete revascularization (IR) was based on outcomes seen in older CABG studies and predate modern medical therapy. </p><p>The hypothesis that CR is superior has been challenged by studies performed in patients on optimal medical therapy and who receive current CABG and PCI techniques, including DES. Early studies comparing IR to CR in patients undergoing stenting found higher rates of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] and the need for repeat revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

CR was achieved in 41 and 67 percent of those receiving PCI or CABG, respectively. Using a definition of CR (applied to the diagnostic angiogram) as any attempt to revascularize all disease segments &ge;1.5 mm, no significant difference was found between those with CR and those with IR in the adjusted rates of five-year death (8.9 versus 8.9 percent; adjusted hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.76-1.43 respectively) or the composite of death, MI, or stroke (12.1 versus 11.9; adjusted hazard ratio 1.04 95% CI 0.79-1.36).

A final kissing balloon postdilation is essential and is performed by readvancing a guidewire and angioplasty balloon through the sides of the parent vessel stent into the side branch and inflating simultaneously with a second balloon positioned within the parent stent.

A modification of the technique has been developed using a two-step approach with one kissing inflation after initial stenting of the side branch and crush with a balloon in the main vessel and a second, or FKBD, after the main vessel stent is placed (the double kissing crush technique). As noted above, this technique has shown benefit over provisional stenting in complex left main coronary artery disease with true distal bifurcation stenosis involving both the left anterior descending and circumflex origins.

Retrospective analyses have raised the possibility of a possible increase in risk (cardiac death or MI) with DES in these vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>]. The BASKET-PROVE trial attempted to directly address this issue by randomly assigning 2314 patients needing stents 3.0 mm or greater in diameter to receive sirolimus-eluting stents, everolimus-eluting stents, or bare-metal stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. While the rate of the primary end point (composite of death from cardiac causes or nonfatal MI at two years) was <strong>lower</strong> with the two DES (2.6 versus 3.2 versus 4.8 percent for sirolimus-eluting stents, everolimus-eluting stents, and bare-metal stents, respectively), these differences did not achieve statistical significance. This was due in part to unexpectedly low event rates, causing the trial to be underpowered to address the issue. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute vessel closure or dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stenting is the treatment of choice for either acute or threatened closure complicating PTCA and for the treatment of dissection; the goal is to restore TIMI 3 flow. In addition, acute or threatened closure may complicate predilation, stent deployment, or postdilation during a planned stent procedure and require the placements of additional stents to achieve optimal results. Failure to adequately restore flow or leaving untreated dissections significantly increases the risk for subacute thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Dissection and abrupt closure after PTCA'</a>.)</p><p>For treatment of acute closure or extensive dissections, the operator must consider other factors that may jeopardize the final result, including the relative size of the vessel, the inflow of blood into the treated segment, and the distal runoff. When either the flow into the artery or distal runoff is compromised, there is an increased risk for acute and subacute stent thrombosis, which may negate the beneficial effects of additional stenting. Smaller caliber vessels treated with smaller diameter stents also have an increased likelihood for subacute thrombosis compared to larger vessels treated with larger diameter stents.</p><p>Emergency surgery may be required in some situations, such as dissection of the left main artery or significant bifurcations, refractory thrombosis, loss of guide wire access, or inability to perform stenting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC CLINICAL SETTINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to their use for specific coronary artery lesions, intracoronary stents, particularly drug-eluting stents, have been used in specific clinical settings in addition with stable or unstable angina.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-eluting intracoronary stents: General principles&quot;, section on 'Efficacy and safety compared to BMS'</a>.)</p><p>This benefit of DES has been demonstrated in a broad array of lesion types including multivessel, ostial, chronic total occlusion, and long lesions, as well as in small coronary arteries. However, coronary artery bypass graft surgery should be considered in some patients such as those with a high risk of coronary artery stent thrombosis and lesions that cannot be adequately revascularized with PCI, as well as some patients with diabetes or left main coronary artery disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Specific coronary lesions'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to specific lesion types, DES are of benefit in specific clinical situations such as in patients with diabetes, acute coronary syndromes, vein graft lesions, and in-stent restenosis. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Specific clinical settings'</a> above.)</p><p>On the other hand, large vessels, especially with focal lesions in patients without diabetes, have lower risk for restenosis and may benefit less from DES.
