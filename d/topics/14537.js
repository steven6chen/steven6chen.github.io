Greater than 70,000 hospitalizations, 800,000 office visits and 500,000 hospital days, have been attributed to tibial shaft fractures alone. While the elderly suffer many of these fractures from falls, the presence of significant osteoporosis increases the risk for compound or more complex fractures with higher morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review issues related to proximal tibial fractures. A general overview of tibial fractures is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PERTINENT ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tibia is the major weight-bearing bone of the lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a>). The proximal portion of the bone, the tibial plateau, forms the lower surface of the knee joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69611 \">figure 1</a>). The thicker of the two articular surfaces is the medial tibial condyle, while the lateral tibial condyle is a relatively thinner and weaker portion of the joint. The anatomy of the knee is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H133527526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>Separating the medial from the lateral tibial condyle is the intercondylar eminence, an important bony prominence that anchors the attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89733\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89733 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Another key bony landmark is the tibial tuberosity which is on the anterior surface, several centimeters below the joint line and the inferior patellar pole, which serves as the attachment site for the patellar tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A strong fibrous structure, the interosseous membrane, connects the tibia and fibula along the length of the two bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77999\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77999 \">figure 2</a>). Proximally, this structure, reinforced by strong anterior and posterior ligaments, forms a synovial joint, the proximal tibiofibular articulation.</p><p>Another fibrous structure, the crural fascia, surrounds the bones and muscles of the lower leg. Fascial extensions and the interosseous membrane separate the muscles, nerves and vessels of the lower leg into four distinct compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 3</a>). Three of these, the anterior, posterior, and deep posterior compartments all border the tibia and can be compromised by tibial injury.</p><p>Nerves and vessels lie within the anterior and the deep posterior compartments and trauma that causes significant swelling in these compartments can result in neurovascular compromise. The key blood supply of the tibia arises from periosteal vessels and the nutrient artery. The nutrient artery originates from the posterior tibial artery and enters the posterolateral cortex at the middle third of the tibial shaft near the origin of the soleus muscle. Fractures in this region potentially compromise this blood supply.</p><p>The periosteal vessels provide a less vulnerable circulation as they derive an abundant blood supply from the anterior tibial artery which travels down along the interosseous membrane. Vascular compromise can arise more proximally from marked effusion of the knee joint or trauma that affects the popliteal artery before it branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries or at the level of the anterior tibial artery as it branches off the popliteal artery and passes through a gap in the interosseous membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The tibial nerve and several branches provide the key innervation to the muscles of the lower leg and foot. Nerve roots arise from L4 through S3. The posterior tibial nerve parallels the course of the posterior tibial artery and courses through the deep posterior compartment. In the popliteal space branches of the tibial nerve provide innervation to the posterior compartment and to the popliteus muscle. The deep peroneal nerve branches and follows the course of the anterior tibial artery providing innervation to muscles in the anterior lower leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant direct trauma, knee hyperextension injuries, and twisting motions in elderly, osteoporotic individuals are among the most common ways that proximal tibial fractures occur. In adults, vehicle-pedestrian collisions, motor vehicle collisions in which the knee is jammed against the dashboard, and collisions during contact sports involving hyperextension of the knee are specific scenarios that lead to injuries to this region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury to the proximal tibia may present as a knee effusion or as localized swelling and tenderness over the bone. Pain may limit the examination and obscure important findings. Careful skin inspection is performed to look for <span class=\"nowrap\">puncture/missile</span> wounds, lacerations, and other evidence of an open fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A knee effusion in a patient with a proximal tibial fracture suggests an osteochondral fracture or an internal derangement (eg, meniscal or ligamentous damage). Aspiration often reveals hemarthrosis and the presence of lipid droplets or cellular bone marrow elements is indicative of an intraarticular fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemarthrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemarthrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ligamentous and meniscal integrity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ligamentous and meniscal injuries frequently occur in conjunction with proximal tibial fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Pain may interfere with accurate assessment of ligamentous and meniscal integrity. Instillation of local anesthetic into the knee joint may facilitate evaluation of these structures, including the anterior drawer <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Lachman test of the ACL, the McMurray test for meniscal damage, and varus and valgus stress testing to evaluate the lateral and medial collateral ligaments, respectively. A detailed description of the use of these and other tests in the evaluation of a patient with knee pain is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than 10 degrees of opening during varus or valgus stress testing is abnormal. Laxity at the joint line suggests a tear of one of the collateral ligaments, while laxity inferior to the joint line suggests a displaced fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute compartment syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute compartment syndrome refers to a constellation of symptoms and findings that result from compromised perfusion of one or more of the muscular compartments of the lower leg. Blood or edema within an encircling fascia impairs circulation and results in unrelenting pain, muscle weakness, and hypesthesia or anesthesia in the skin supplied by nerves that course through the fascially enclosed compartment. Of the four compartments of the lower leg, the anterior, superficial posterior, and deep posterior compartments all border the tibia and can be compromised by tibial injury. Tibial fracture is the most common injury associated with acute compartment syndrome of an extremity.</p><p>Tense swelling of the affected muscles, decreased distal pulses, muscle weakness, increased pain elicited by passive stretch of involved muscles, and impaired sensation due to nerve compression or ischemia may be noted on examination. This may progress to pulselessness, paralysis, and anesthesia. Permanent neuromuscular damage may ensue if the compartment pressure is not decreased promptly by fasciotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A retrospective study reported factors that correlate with an increased risk of compartment syndrome in patients with tibial plateau fractures. This study of 162 tibial plateau fractures reported the overall risk of compartment syndrome to be 11 percent, and found that femoral displacement and tibial widening on plain radiographs, as well as a higher Schatzker classification, were important risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard radiographs for suspected proximal tibial fracture include anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and intercondylar notch views. When clinical suspicion of fracture is high but plain radiographs are equivocal, computed tomography (CT scan) better defines the fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may demonstrate bone bruising and associated meniscus or ligamentous injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. For this reason many clinicians prefer to follow standard radiographs with MRI to define the extent of injury when initial imaging is unremarkable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58064419\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the proximal tibia occur most often from direct trauma to the region at or just distal to the knee, and are diagnosed by radiograph. In most instances, plain radiographs are sufficient. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58064545\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for pain at or around the knee following acute trauma is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin#H6196446\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;, section on 'Acute knee pain associated with trauma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT BY FRACTURE LOCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal tibial fractures are classified for management purposes into those that affect the medial or lateral tibial plateau and fractures of the intercondylar notch.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Tibial plateau fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tibial plateau fractures account for approximately one percent of all fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. They most commonly involve the lateral plateau after a forceful, direct blow to the lateral knee. A review involving a population sample of approximately 576,000 adults found the overall incidence to be 10.3 per 100,000 people annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Greater numbers of proximal tibia fractures occurred in men (189 men versus 166 women) with the mean age at the time of injury being 52.6 years. Men sustained more injuries when below 50, while women older than 50 sustained markedly more fractures than men. </p><p>Radiographs include lateral, anterior-posterior (AP - (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70950\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70950 \">image 1</a>)), and oblique views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77716\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77716 \">image 2</a>) and typically reveal a depression of the lateral tibial plateau in moderate to severe fractures. In more subtle injuries, radiographs may appear normal or show only a slight increase in the density of the bone on an AP view.</p><p>When clinical suspicion of fracture is high and plain radiographs are equivocal, many clinicians prefer to proceed to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of the ability to visualize bone bruising and associated meniscal or ligamentous injury. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is another alternative if MRI is contraindicated or not available. CT will better define a fracture but does not allow meniscal or ligamentous injuries to be assessed.</p><p>Medial tibial plateau fractures require a higher force since this side of the joint has more strength. A strong medial force or an axial load such as landing on one's feet after falling from a height are potential mechanisms. When standard radiographs suggest a medial injury, additional imaging may demonstrate simultaneous fractures of both plateaus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for orthopedic referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency (ie, immediate) surgical consultation is required for open fractures and those that cause vascular compromise or acute compartment syndrome. Fractures with <strong>any</strong> degree of displacement or depression, even just a few millimeters, or those associated with suspected or documented meniscal or ligamentous injury merit orthopedic consultation within 48 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compression, icing, appropriate analgesics, splinting of the knee in near-full extension, intermittent elevation of the leg above heart level, and strict non-weight bearing are the initial treatments for a tibial plateau fracture. Significant injuries are stabilized and orthopedic consultation is obtained. The majority of fractures, particularly those sustained from a high energy mechanism, require surgical treatment with open reduction and internal fixation.</p><p>For a relatively small subset of fractures without displacement, depression of the tibial plateau, or associated injuries of significance (eg, knee ligament tear), at the first follow-up visit the patient is placed in a hinged brace that is locked in near-full extension and advised to continue non-weight bearing for the affected extremity, and to ambulate with crutches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Follow-up care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncomplicated proximal tibial fractures without any displacement, depression of the tibial plateau, or associated ligamentous or meniscal injury are amenable to non-operative management by clinicians experienced managing such fractures. After brace fitting, the patient returns weekly for the first three weeks following injury. If there is no displacement at two weeks, the patient begins working on knee flexion in the brace with a goal of achieving 90 degrees by four weeks. Plain radiographs are repeated weekly for three weeks and then on a two to three week basis depending on radiographic appearance.</p><p>Strict non-weight bearing is the norm for six weeks, but this period may be adjusted based on the injury and clinical progress. Partial weight bearing in the brace can begin once there is adequate radiographic healing (ie, bony callus is present).</p><p>Bracing continues until radiographic healing appears complete &ndash; this typically requires 8 to 12 weeks. The patient begins exercises to regain lower extremity strength following removal of the brace. Patients rarely regain full function in less than 12 weeks and more often require 16 to 20 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Return to sport or work</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the injured extremity has regained approximately 80 to 90 percent of the strength of the uninvolved extremity, the patient may resume work that does not place undue stress on the leg and may begin sport-specific functional rehabilitation. This particularly applies to non-weight bearing activities. Healing should be nearly complete before more stressful activity or prolonged weight bearing is attempted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8958482\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is the most common, significant short-term complication associated with tibial fracture. ACS is a limb-threatening emergency and immediate orthopedic consultation is required when the diagnosis is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acute compartment syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p>Proximal tibia fractures are frequently sustained in motor vehicle collisions or other major traumatic events in which patients suffer other severe injuries, which often delays the return to daily activity. Given the high-energy trauma often involved in proximal tibial fractures, complications occur with some frequency and may include infection, non-union or malunion, and stiffness of the knee. Nevertheless, overall outcomes are generally good over the short term, although data is limited. In an observational study of 244 tibial plateau fractures treated surgically, 190 had what were considered good outcomes, but 54 had significant long-term morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Outcomes are generally better in younger patients. A retrospective study of 47 tibial plateau fractures treated surgically found that patients younger than 40 years experienced substantially less disability compared to age-matched controls than older patients compared to their controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One important functional complication following tibial plateau fractures is an inability to regain normal gait. According to a small case-control study, following this injury patients showed slower cadence and shorter stride length, such that walking speed declined 18 percent compared to controls. These patterns persisted after three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The major long-term complication of tibial plateau fractures is osteoarthritis of the knee. However, radiologic findings one year following injury, even when some arthritic change is noted, are not accurate predictors of diminished functional outcome over the mid to long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Difficulty recovering normal gait is an important complication, and contributes to the relatively high number of patients who develop ankle osteoarthritis. Other complications include chronic pain over the fracture and any surgical incision sites, as well as thinning and irritation of overlying skin. All of these long-term complications occur more frequently in patients over 40 and in those with comorbidities such as diabetes.</p><p>Data pertaining to long term outcomes is limited. Researchers in one study used a validated assessment instrument (KOOS score) to survey 71 patients 5 to 11 years following surgical repair for a tibial plateau fracture and found that many reported clinically significant reductions in overall functional outcomes and knee-related performance in sport and recreation activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a similar study with six-year follow-up, knee-related outcomes for 82 patients were rated as fair and functional outcomes for sport and recreation as poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition these patients rated their health-related quality of life lower than an age-matched population. High energy trauma was associated with poor outcomes.</p><p>Long-term population based cohort studies of 8426 patients compared to controls show that tibial plateau fractures requiring surgery significantly increases the likelihood (5.3 LR) of total knee replacement. At 10 years, 7.3 percent of patients required such replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior tibial spine and intercondylar notch fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avulsion of the anterior tibial spine is particularly common in skeletally immature adolescents but can also occur in young adults. Adults with the same mechanism of injury are more likely to sustain a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). With avulsion, the affected knee often has a significant effusion and aspiration may show blood and or fat indicative of an intraarticular fracture. The treatment of avulsion of the anterior tibial spine is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal tibial fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Tibial spine avulsion'</a>.)</p><p>Whether these fractures occur in skeletally immature or mature patients seems to have little effect on long-term outcomes. In a series of 37 cases that required surgical fixation of the tibial spine followed a mean of 16 years, two patients developed osteoarthritis of the knee. Using functional scores (WOMAC, Lysholm), 86 percent were classified as having good to excellent results. Knee examination demonstrated stability and adequate flexion (average 130 degrees). The 16 patients in this cohort with open growth plates at the time of injury did not develop malalignment or malrotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Tibial tubercle avulsions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tubercle avulsions occur at the apophysis of the anterior tibia where the patellar tendon attaches. These injuries are rare, representing less than one percent of physeal fractures. A few case reports describe bilateral avulsions. The mechanisms most often noted are knee flexion at the beginning of a jump or an awkward landing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Plain radiographs demonstrate displacement of a reasonable sized fragment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65878\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65878 \">image 3</a>). In adolescents, an unfused growth plate may cause confusion with an avulsion fracture. The treatment of avulsion of the anterior tibial tubercle is discussed in greater detail separately.
