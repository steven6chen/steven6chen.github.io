The initial approach to eye injury, as with any trauma, must involve careful triage. Because the eyes are located near vital the intracranial space, the cervical spine, and the airway, life-threatening injuries involving these structures need to be considered prior to assessing periocular and ocular damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once life-threatening injuries are excluded or identified and treated, the emergency clinician should identify threats to vision using a focused history and an organized approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F104435\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104435 \">algorithm 1</a>). A systematic approach to the evaluation of patients with eye injuries will lead to the rapid recognition and treatment of vision-threatening conditions including caustic eye exposures, orbital compartment syndrome (OCS), and open-globe injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-eye-injuries-in-the-emergency-department#H1901186\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to eye injuries in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with a high likelihood of an open globe based upon mechanism of injury (eg, penetrating eye injury) or physical findings (obvious perforation with teardrop pupil, vitreous extrusion, or protruding intraocular foreign body), the emergency clinician should <strong>avoid</strong> any further examination procedure that might apply pressure to the eyeball, such as eyelid retraction or intraocular pressure measurement by tonometry and <strong>avoid</strong> placing any medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracaine</a>) or diagnostic eye drops (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a>) into the eye. Any protruding foreign bodies should be left in place. The emergency clinician should place a shield over the eye and emergently consult an ophthalmologist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50022\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50022 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-globe-injuries-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-management#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open globe injuries: Emergency evaluation and initial management&quot;, section on 'Primary evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p>In young children, the extent of ocular injury often cannot be assessed by the emergency clinician due to poor cooperation. In these cases, an examination by an ophthalmologist should be performed. Examination under anesthesia in the operating room may be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1904568\"><span class=\"h1\">VISION-THREATENING CONDITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1904574\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular chemical burns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eye contact with acids or alkalis requires emergent evaluation and treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. Burn severity depends upon the agent involved, duration of exposure, and depth of penetration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56411 \">table 2</a>). Alkaline substances usually cause more severe damage than acids. Patients with chemical eye burns present with decreased vision, moderate to severe eye pain, blepharospasm (inability to open the eyelids), conjunctival redness, and photophobia. In severe cases of alkali exposure, the eye may appear white due to ischemia of the conjunctiva and scleral vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67858 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-chemical-burns#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical chemical burns&quot;, section on 'Eye exposure'</a>.)</p><p>With any significant ocular exposure to alkali or acid, continuous irrigation with water or saline is recommended until a neutral pH is achieved in the eye. Irrigation initiated at the scene is continued at the emergency department. Once at the hospital, the author prefers prolonged irrigation using intravenous tubing and manual active irrigation. Normalization of pH for most eye exposures typically takes 30 to 60 minutes. During irrigation, the provider should keep the eyelids retracted for maximal exposure of the conjunctiva and cornea. Irrigation of the fornices is particularly important in cases of wet plaster or cement exposure because the retained debris serves as a depot for further alkali injury. Irrigation should be less forceful if a concomitant globe rupture is suspected. &#160;</p><p>Polymethylmethacrylate scleral lens (ie, Morgan lens) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51399\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51399 \">figure 1</a>) are frequently employed rather than active manual irrigation for chemical eye exposures but may not be as effective for irrigation of the fornices. However, if prolonged irrigation beyond 60 minutes is needed or if staffing limits the ability to do active external irrigation, then a Morgan lens may be the best approach.

Trauma and intraorbital hemorrhage can cause rapidly elevated intraorbital pressure. This pressure is transmitted to the eye and optic nerve causing ischemia and an orbital compartment syndrome (OCS).

Retinal hemorrhage, tears, or detachment may be evident on direct ophthalmoscopy. However, urgent examination by an ophthalmologist, including slit lamp evaluation and indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression is essential for full characterization of the retinal injury. Scleral depression is not performed acutely in patients with a concomitant traumatic hyphema or iritis. In patients with vitreous hemorrhage that obscures the fundus but who have a closed globe, orbital ultrasound can identify a retinal detachment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95453\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95453 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Specific retinal injuries and potential interventions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute retinal break</strong> &ndash; The patient may complain of light flashes, floaters, or spots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-eye-injuries-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The nerve may be contused or even avulsed. The optic nerve rarely may be directly injured by a needle puncture during ophthalmic surgery or by hemorrhage within the orbit. (See <a href=\"#H1904731\" class=\"local\">'Orbital compartment syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect optic nerve injury, much more common than direct injury, results from contusion of the nerve within the optic canal. The usual cause is a forceful blow to the temple or the brow. The concussion is transmitted to the walls of the optic canal where the optic nerve becomes bruised, with optic nerve shearing. Sometimes, avulsion can arise from rapid deceleration of the head or rotation of the globe. Optic canal fractures are sometimes found in these circumstances, but the fracture is typically not the cause of optic nerve injury and does not warrant repair. Although abusive head trauma is a rare cause of optic nerve injury, it is an important consideration in infants who do not have a known history of significant head trauma.
