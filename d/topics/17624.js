However, pediatric MS, defined as onset of MS before the age of 18, is increasingly recognized and accounts for approximately 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This disorder was previously known as early onset MS (EOMS) and juvenile MS.</p><p>Since pediatric MS is rare, clinicians who see a child with recurrent episodes of acute neurologic symptoms and white matter lesions on brain MRI might initially consider a differential diagnosis that includes leukodystrophies, vasculopathies, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, mitochondrial defects, and other metabolic disorders, rather than MS. Given the availability of disease modifying therapies for MS and the impact on future prognosis, it is important to consider the possibility of pediatric MS in all children with white matter disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-acute-central-nervous-system-demyelination-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of acute central nervous system demyelination in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prognosis and treatments for children with MS are different from those of the more common adult form, and to a large extent are understudied. This topic will review the treatment and prognosis of pediatric MS. Some of the references on therapy refer to adult patients, since data are limited in pediatric MS and it is assumed that the disease response is likely to be similar.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of pediatric MS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of pediatric multiple sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progression of disability due to MS is highly variable, but accumulating data suggest that progression is slow in most adults with MS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis#H605008317\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical course and classification of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Rate of worsening'</a>.)</p><p>Several observational studies have found that a younger age at MS onset is associated with slower disease progression in terms of disability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71819\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71819 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Although not definitive, some data suggest that individuals with pediatric-onset MS have a paradoxically higher annualized relapse rate than those with adult-onset MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Despite the slower progression, because of their earlier onset, patients with pediatric-onset MS reach disability landmarks at younger ages than those with adult onset MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. One of the largest natural history studies of pediatric MS followed a cohort of 394 patients from France and Belgium who were 16 years old or younger at MS onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These were compared with 1775 patients who were older than 16 at MS onset. The following results were reported for patients with pediatric-onset MS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated median time from disease onset to the assignment of a Kurtzke Disability Status Score of 6 (ie, assistance needed for walking) was 29 years (95% CI 27-33), and the corresponding median age was 42 years (approximately 10 years younger than the estimated median age for adult onset MS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated median time from disease onset to conversion to secondary progression was 28 years (approximately 10 years longer than adult onset MS), and the corresponding median age was 41 years (approximately 10 years younger than adult onset MS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher relapse rate during the first two years of disease was associated with an increased rate of disability</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A progressive course at MS onset occurred in only 2 percent of children, and was associated with a shorter time to reach irreversible disability</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF ACUTE ATTACKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are the mainstay for treatment of acute MS attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They rapidly decrease inflammation and hasten recovery from an acute MS attack.</p><p>Pulse intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> given once daily for five days is a typical regimen used to treat an acute attack of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. No further glucocorticoids are given for patients who demonstrate complete recovery of their symptoms. However, a tapering oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> course can be used for patients with residual disability, starting with prednisone 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day and decreasing by 5 mg every two days.</p><p>For patients who show recurrence of symptoms during the glucocorticoid taper, retreatment with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> given once daily for five days) is a reasonable option. Therapeutic plasma exchange can be beneficial in patients with fulminant attacks that do not respond to glucocorticoids.<em> </em>Typically one plasma volume is exchanged every other day for a total of five to six exchanges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].<em> </em>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) can also be given in this setting and in the occasional patient who fails to respond to glucocorticoids. The usual dose of IVIG is 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERFERONS AND GLATIRAMER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunomodulatory agents are utilized for long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81947 \">table 1</a>). These agents, which include interferon beta drugs (interferon beta-1a and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-beta-1b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon beta-1b</a>) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], reduce the frequency of clinical relapses in adults with the relapsing form of multiple sclerosis by approximately 30 percent. They also decrease inflammatory lesion activity on MRI as well as prevent brain atrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease-modifying treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Interferons'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease-modifying treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Glatiramer'</a>.)</p><p>There have been no randomized controlled trials evaluating immunomodulatory disease modifying therapies in pediatric MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The literature describing the effectiveness and tolerability of these agents in children is limited to isolated case series and case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. Nevertheless, as in adults, interferon beta and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a> appear to reduce relapse rates and possibly reduce the progression of disability in pediatric patients with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Supporting evidence comes from an observational study that evaluated 65 patients with MS who were treated during childhood or adolescence at 15 centers in Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The mean age at onset of MS was 12 years. There were three treatment groups: 38 children received interferon beta-1a (Avonex) once weekly, nine received glatiramer acetate, and 18 received interferon beta-1a (Rebif) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-beta-1b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon beta-1b</a> (Betaferon) three times weekly. The mean treatment duration was 23, 33, and 41 months, respectively. The following observations were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean annualized relapse rate decreased from initial to final assessment to a similar degree in each group:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avonex: 2.4 to 0.4</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Glatiramer: 2.8 to 0.25</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rebif-Betaferon: 3.2 to 0.8</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores from initial to final assessment showed little or no change in each group.

A full dose is given to children weighing &ge;50 kg.</p><p>The most common side effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a> is an erythematous skin reaction localized to the injection site. This is usually transient and resolves with continued treatment. Patients should be warned about alarming but transient idiosyncratic reactions consisting of chest pain and flushing that may occur immediately after injection.</p><p>For patients taking interferons, the most common side effects include flu-like symptoms and headache. Transient elevations of liver aminotransferases, leukopenia, and thyroid function abnormalities (hypothyroidism more often than hyperthyroidism) can occur at the initiation of therapy. These laboratory tests should be serially monitored early in the treatment course, and intermittently thereafter. Abnormalities will often resolve with transient reduction in dosing.</p><p>All sexually active females should be counseled on the importance of contraception because of concern for teratogenicity of these agents. Interferons are category C for pregnancy risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DRUG%2F50021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50021 \">table 2</a>). Interferon beta treatment should be discontinued if a woman becomes pregnant or plans to become pregnant during therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing an agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend treatment with a disease modifying immunomodulatory agent for children who develop relapsing-remitting MS. Reasonable choices for therapy are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a>, interferon beta-1a (Avonex), interferon beta-1a (Rebif), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-beta-1b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon beta-1b</a> (Betaseron), and peginterferon beta-1a. All of these agents appear to have similar effectiveness for MS, and the initial choice of disease modifying immunomodulatory agent is highly influenced by patient and family preferences.</p><p>Interferon beta-1a (30 mcg intramuscular injection, Avonex) or peginterferon beta-1a (125 mcg subcutaneous injection) are often preferred by patients, since injections are limited to once per week or every 14 days, respectively. This is particularly helpful for patients with needle phobia. However, the intramuscular injection may be less well-tolerated by some patients.</p><p>The use of interferon beta drugs is generally avoided in adolescents who have comorbid depression, since there is concern that these agents may exacerbate depressive symptoms. In such patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a> is the preferred drug. In addition, glatiramer acetate is suggested for patients who have persistent liver function abnormalities following initiation of an interferon.</p><p>The decision process regarding the choice of therapy must include the child and family. Counseling the family on the medications and providing them with written information to review allows them to reach an educated decision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING RESPONSE TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both clinical and neuroimaging parameters can be used to monitor response to disease modifying MS therapy. The International Pediatric MS Study Group suggests neurologic examinations at baseline, and after initiating therapy at one, three, and six months, and every six months thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In clinically stable children without attacks, yearly follow-up and neurologic examination may be sufficient.</p><p>Independent of the patient's clinical status, ongoing disease activity on brain MRI may suggest the need for an alternate immunomodulatory agent or more aggressive treatment. While there is no firmly established consensus, comparative yearly MRIs are considered by many to be a neuroimaging measure of treatment response. Patients with a high annual relapse rate often have more frequent imaging performed.</p><p>The International Pediatric MS Study Group suggests obtaining repeat brain MRI scans 6 to 12 months after the initiation of an immunomodulatory agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The repeat scan is compared with the baseline scan performed prior to treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For clinically stable patients with no new T2 lesions or gadolinium enhancement, the MRI can be repeated yearly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with several new T2 lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> several lesions with gadolinium enhancement on follow-up imaging, repeat MRI should be performed again in six months. Changing disease modifying therapy can be considered if the MRI continues to demonstrate a significantly increasing burden of disease, as measured by new T2 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gadolinium enhancing lesions.

Multiple sclerosis profoundly affects all aspects of the child's life, and also has significant effects on the families. It is potentially a life-long diagnosis with implications of progressive disability. In addition, children with MS must often handle the considerable burden of daily to weekly injections of immunomodulatory agents. Nevertheless, many children seem to cope with the diagnosis fairly well, while their parents and other family members often have greater difficulty. This may relate to the &quot;invincible&quot; attitude of most adolescents. The clinician should carefully note changing psychosocial dynamics of the patient and his or her family.</p><p>The evaluation and treatment of pediatric depression is discussed in detail separately.

Glucocorticoids can be stopped without a taper in children who demonstrate complete recovery, while a tapering oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> regimen can be used for patients with residual disability. We taper by starting oral prednisone at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day and decreasing by 5 mg every two days. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute attacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with acute exacerbation of MS who fail to respond to IV glucocorticoid therapy, we suggest intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for five days (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For children who relapse during a taper of glucocorticoids, we suggest either retreatment with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for five days (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), or IVIG 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for five days (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Therapeutic plasma exchange (one total volume exchange every other day for five to six sessions) is an alternative if IVIG is not an option. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute attacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children who develop relapsing-remitting MS, we recommend treatment with a disease modifying immunomodulatory agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Reasonable choices for therapy are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a>, interferon beta-1a (Avonex), interferon beta-1a (Rebif), peginterferon beta-1a, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-beta-1b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon beta-1b</a> (Betaseron). All of these agents appear to have similar effectiveness for MS in adult clinical trials, and the initial choice of disease modifying immunomodulatory agent is highly influenced by patient and family preferences. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Interferons and glatiramer'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both clinical and neuroimaging parameters can be used to monitor response to disease modifying MS therapy. Patients are considered to have an inadequate response to therapy (ie, minimum six months on full-dose therapy and fully compliant with treatment) if they develop two or more relapses in a 12-month period, an increase or no reduction in relapse rate, or new T2 or contrast enhancing brain lesions on MRI compared with the pre-treatment period.

As examples, patients who are poor responders to interferon beta-1a once weekly can be switched to a higher dose interferon preparation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-beta-1b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon beta-1b</a> every other day or interferon beta-1a three times weekly), or switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a>. Poor responders to higher dose interferon can be switched to glatiramer acetate. Poor responders to glatiramer acetate can be switched to one of the interferon beta drugs.
