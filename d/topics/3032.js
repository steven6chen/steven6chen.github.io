Iron is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract; the duodenum is the site of maximal absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, a number of factors determine the efficiency of iron absorption, and a number of medical conditions may interfere with normal uptake of dietary iron. The most clinically important are disorders that affect the mucosal cells responsible for iron absorption, such as celiac disease, atrophic gastritis, <em>Helicobacter pylori </em>(<em>H. pylori</em>) infection, and bariatric surgery. Inherited disorders that interfere with iron absorption are very rare.</p><p>Dietary heme iron (iron from meat rather than plant sources) is better absorbed than non-heme iron, and an acidic environment (eg, normal gastric acid without acid-reducing medications) facilitates absorption. There are also a number of foods that may impair iron absorption such as tannates, phosphates, phytates (mineral-binding compounds found in whole grains and seeds), and foods high in calcium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64874 \">table 2</a>). It would be very difficult to develop iron deficiency solely due to these factors, but they may contribute to iron deficiency in the setting of blood loss, or, less commonly, extremely low intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2715991644\"><span class=\"h3\">Celiac disease/atrophic gastritis/H. pylori</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Celiac disease (also called gluten-sensitive enteropathy or nontropical sprue) is a disorder of small bowel inflammation triggered by exposure to gluten in susceptible individuals. It predominantly affects whites of northern European ancestry, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 70 to 1 in 300 (0.3 to 1 percent) in these populations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Celiac disease</strong> &ndash; Celiac disease can contribute to anemia by several mechanisms, including iron deficiency, reduced absorption of supplemental iron, and malabsorption of other nutrients required for red blood cell (RBC) production including vitamin B12, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, and copper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There may also be a component of anemia of chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease) as well as blood loss, although the contribution (if any) of gastrointestinal blood loss from celiac disease to iron deficiency is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Various reports have commented on the unexpected presence of celiac disease in individuals with iron deficiency and vice versa. As an example, in a series of 102 patients diagnosed with celiac disease in a northern European hospital, 70 had anemia as the presenting feature, and 34 of these 70 (approximately half) were premenopausal women, who might otherwise be thought to have iron deficiency on the basis of heavy menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In another series of 200 Scandinavian patients with anemia who underwent testing for celiac disease, 10 (5 percent) were found to be positive by serologic testing confirmed by intestinal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastritis and </strong><strong><em>H. pylori</em></strong> &ndash; Gastritis related to an autoimmune mechanism or <em>H. pylori</em> has also been implicated in causing iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In a series of 150 patients (mostly adults) with iron deficiency anemia, refractoriness to oral iron treatment was noted in 24 of 34 (71 percent) with antiparietal cell antibodies and autoimmune gastritis, and in 15 of 22 (68 percent) with <em>H. pylori </em>(as well as all eight with celiac disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another series of 71 patients with iron deficiency anemia who did not have an obvious source of blood loss and underwent upper and lower endoscopy, diagnoses related to reduced absorption included atrophic gastritis in 19 (27 percent) and <em>H. pylori</em> in 13 (18 percent), as well as celiac disease in four (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>The possibility of these conditions should be reviewed in individuals with unexplained iron deficiency, especially those at increased risk based on demographic features and those for whom oral iron therapy is ineffective.

Procedures that bypass the duodenum such as roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) have the greatest risk of causing iron deficiency because they reduce the site of maximal absorption and in some cases reduce gastric acid availability.

Thus, iron deficiency will develop in almost all patients undergoing dialysis who are treated with EPO, as well as some individuals with chronic renal failure not receiving dialysis, unless supplemental iron is administered. This subject is discussed in detail in separate topic reviews.

These stages are defined by the extent of depletion, first of iron stores and then of iron available for hemoglobin synthesis. Eventually, if negative iron balance continues, the iron and hemoglobin deficiency are so severe that production of iron-deficient RBCs and anemia occurs.</p><p>In the first stage, iron stores can be totally depleted without causing anemia. Once these stores are depleted, there is still enough iron present in the body within the &quot;labile&quot; iron pool from the daily turnover of red cells for normal hemoglobin synthesis, but the individual becomes vulnerable to development of anemia should there be further iron losses. Some individuals with extremely low levels of serum ferritin, but without anemia, may have symptoms of fatigue or show decreased exercise tolerance at this stage.</p><p>Further loss of iron results in anemia, which is initially normocytic with a normal absolute reticulocyte count (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236 \">table 4</a>). This stage of iron deficiency is common in the United States.

Reticulocyte production cannot be increased in the setting of iron deficiency, and the reticulocyte count becomes inappropriately low (despite being in the &quot;normal&quot; range in many cases). It is worth noting, however, that other concomitant causes of anemia such as vitamin B12 deficiency may cause macrocytosis and obscure the microcytosis caused by iron deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>The normal physiologic changes in response to iron deficiency produce a number of compensatory changes, including increased production of erythropoietin and reduced production of hepcidin, provided that renal function is normal and that the individual does not have an inflammatory condition that suppresses hepcidin production.

For those with microcytic or normocytic anemia, a reticulocyte count should be used to determine whether there is decreased RBC production, which is consistent with iron deficiency; increased RBC destruction (hemolysis); or blood loss. Review of the peripheral blood smear is likely to provide valuable information regarding the characteristic morphologies seen in iron deficiency anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64267 \">picture 7</a>) versus other causes of anemia. The patient's history, CBC, RBC indices, and findings on the peripheral blood smear usually allow the clinician to make a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Morphologic approach'</a>.)</p><p>There are two complementary ways to confirm (or exclude) the diagnosis of iron deficiency: iron studies (see <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Iron studies (list of available tests)'</a> below) and assessment of the response to a trial of iron therapy (see <a href=\"#H1232968741\" class=\"local\">'Response to a therapeutic trial of iron'</a> below). In the vast majority of individuals, iron studies should be obtained. The results help to distinguish iron deficiency from other conditions, document the severity of the deficiency (if present), and provide a baseline prior to initiating iron administration. Exceptions may include individuals who do not have access to this testing (eg, in low-resource settings) or in routine obstetric practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy#H717781762\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Iron'</a>.)</p><p>Even before the diagnosis of iron deficiency is confirmed, patients with suspected iron deficiency should be evaluated for the source of the deficiency, which is more likely to be dietary in individuals in resource-poor settings and more likely to be due to blood loss in menstruating or pregnant females and adults of either sex. The evaluation may include a thorough history and physical examination. Additional testing is discussed below, including colonoscopy if iron deficiency is confirmed. (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Search for source of blood and iron loss'</a> below.)</p><p>The gold standard for documenting iron deficiency is an iron stain (Prussian blue stain) of a bone marrow aspirate smear to assess iron stores in bone marrow macrophages and erythroid precursors (sideroblasts) on marrow spicules. Lack of stainable iron in erythroid precursors as well as bone marrow macrophages is consistent with iron deficiency, whereas in anemia of chronic disease, increased stainable iron is seen in marrow macrophages but stainable iron is absent or reduced in erythroid precursors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70226\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70226 \">picture 8</a>). However, as noted in the following sections, other less-invasive and less-expensive methods are available and effective for confirming or excluding iron deficiency in the vast majority of cases. In some cases where there is an obvious other explanation for anemia and the patient is undergoing bone marrow testing, iron deficiency may be a surprise finding. In these cases, it is important to ensure that proper controls and confirmatory testing is performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron studies (list of available tests)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by reduced or absent iron stores and increased levels of transferrin proteins that facilitate iron uptake and transport to RBC precursors in the bone marrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236 \">table 4</a>). Of these iron studies, ferritin remains the most useful test, and most patients require only a ferritin level or testing of ferritin, iron, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC), from which one calculates transferrin saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/21,22,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,72</a>]. It is important to consider the entire clinical picture when deciding which tests to order and when evaluating test results.</p><p>Expected results of these and other tests in adults with iron deficiency are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum iron</strong> &ndash; Iron can be measured in serum (preferred) or plasma. The test measures circulating iron, most of which is bound to the transport protein transferrin. Serum iron is low in iron deficiency as well as in anemia of chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease [ACD]). This is because levels of serum iron depend on the efficiency of iron recycling by bone marrow and reticuloendothelial macrophages, which is reduced in both conditions. Serum iron can also fluctuate with dietary intake and normal diurnal variation. By itself, low serum iron is not diagnostic of any condition but must be evaluated in light of other tests such as transferrin saturation and ferritin. (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum transferrin</strong> &ndash; Transferrin is a circulating transport protein for iron. It is increased in iron deficiency but can be decreased in ACD. Transferrin can also be reported as TIBC. The transferrin concentration (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> can be converted to the TIBC (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> by multiplying by 1.389 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transferrin saturation</strong> &ndash; Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is the ratio of serum iron to TIBC: (serum iron &#160;&divide; &#160;TIBC &#160;x &#160;100). In iron deficiency, iron is reduced and TIBC is increased, resulting in a lower transferrin saturation. Normal values are in the range of 25 to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/58,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,84</a>]. Values below 10 percent are common in individuals with iron deficiency, and a cutoff of below 16 percent is generally used to screen for iron deficiency, although other thresholds may be used in some settings such as pregnancy (see <a href=\"#H3210435842\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> below). Because the TSAT is a ratio, in principle, an increase in the serum iron (eg, due to hemolysis or recent ingestion of an iron tablet) can raise the value, even in an individual who has iron deficiency and an increased TIBC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum ferritin</strong> &ndash; Ferritin is a circulating iron storage protein that is increased in proportion to body iron stores. However, ferritin is also an acute phase reactant (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>) that can increase independently of iron status in disorders associated with inflammation, infection, liver disease, heart failure, and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Thus, a very low ferritin level (eg, &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [&lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L])</span> is highly specific for iron deficiency, but a higher ferritin level may be &quot;falsely normal&quot; and cannot be used to eliminate the possibility of iron deficiency in individuals with comorbidities. The sensitivity for iron deficiency increases as the cutoff is raised, but specificity decreases; the ideal value is not clear and different values have been suggested for different populations, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2292235433\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and sTfR-ferritin index</strong> &ndash; Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), also called circulating transferrin receptor or serum transferrin receptor, is a circulating protein derived from cleavage of the membrane transferrin receptor on bone marrow erythroid precursor cells. Its concentration in serum is directly proportional to erythropoietic rate and inversely proportional to tissue iron availability, similar to serum transferrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Thus, iron-deficient patients generally have increased levels of sTfR, with reference ranges determined by the individual laboratory performing the testing. sTfR is not used in routine practice but can be helpful in complex cases (see <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Patients with inconclusive initial testing or comorbidities'</a> below). The major advantage of sTfR is that it reflects overall erythropoiesis, which is increased in iron deficiency. However, sTfR can be elevated in patients with hemolysis or with administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">sTfR-ferritin index is calculated as the ratio of the sTfR (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> to the logarithm of the serum ferritin (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L):</span> (sTfR &#160;&divide; &#160;log[ferritin]). The sTfR reflects erythropoiesis, while the ferritin reflects the tissue iron stores; thus, a high sTfR-ferritin index (eg, above 2 to 3) is very likely to be a sign of iron deficiency due to increased erythropoietic drive and low iron stores. This index may be especially useful for population-based studies and for distinguishing between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) (see <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below) because sTfR is increased in iron deficiency and normal in ACD, whereas ferritin is decreased in iron deficiency and normal to increased in ACD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/21,56,87-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,56,87-90</a>]. Patients with ACD are likely to have an sTfR-ferritin index &lt;1, whereas those with isolated iron deficiency or iron deficiency plus ACD are likely to have an sTfR-ferritin index &gt;2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some studies have shown the serum ferritin to be equally useful as the sTfR or the sTfR-ferritin index whereas others have found low serum ferritin to be a better predictor of iron deficiency than sTfR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>].

Thus, elevated erythrocyte (RBC) zinc protoporphyrin (eg, &gt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> is consistent with iron deficiency. However, zinc protoporphyrin is not specific for iron deficiency as it may be elevated in inflammatory states, hemodialysis, and lead poisoning. These assays are not widely available or routinely used for diagnosing iron deficiency. Their role in the diagnosis of other disorders (eg, lead poisoning, porphyria) is discussed separately.

Such a patient is likely to have a brisk response to iron therapy.

The diagnosis of iron deficiency can usually be made from the serum ferritin alone or the ferritin, iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation without scheduling another visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/94-96,98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96,98,99</a>]. However, in patients with a strong suspicion for iron deficiency, a normal ferritin value should not be used to exclude the possibility of iron deficiency; these individuals may require additional evaluations.

However, changes in ferritin in inflammatory states can be highly variable, and other methods of determining iron deficiency in the setting of inflammation may be more helpful (eg, trial of iron administration; sTfR-ferritin index).

Confidence in the diagnosis of iron deficiency is greater with lower TSAT values, although the optimal threshold for TSAT to use for iron deficiency has not been established. The likelihood of iron deficiency is very high with a TSAT of &lt;10 percent (&lt;20 percent if concomitant inflammation); a TSAT value &lt;16 percent is indicative of a need to address possible iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/21,22,100,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,100,104</a>].

Serum ferritin is a good initial screening test. In one study of pregnant women, a serum ferritin concentration &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> was the best single indicator of reduced storage iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

Measurement of serum iron, <span class=\"nowrap\">transferrin/TIBC,</span> and percent saturation of TIBC had significantly lower diagnostic accuracy; this may be because pregnancy increases the transferrin concentration (and thus decreases the percent saturation) independent of iron stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

Further, it may be difficult to determine the reason(s) for a lack of response to iron if iron studies are not available. Additionally, administration of iron to an individual with thalassemia will worsen the existing iron overload commonly seen in this condition. Thus, it may be prudent to obtain iron studies to confirm the diagnosis even in cases where iron deficiency is considered extremely likely.

The absolute prevalence depends on the population studied. (See <a href=\"#H2260407746\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major causes of iron deficiency include blood loss and reduced absorption (eg, due to celiac disease, <em>Helicobacter pylori </em>[<em>H. pylori</em>], gastritis, or bariatric surgery). Less common causes include use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), urinary or pulmonary hemosiderosis, or rare inherited disorders. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Causes of iron deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron deficiency occurs in several stages, as illustrated by progressive changes in laboratory findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Stages of iron deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of iron deficiency depend on severity and may include symptoms of anemia, pica, and restless legs syndrome. The examination may be normal or show pallor, alopecia, dry skin, atrophic glossitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54472\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54472 \">picture 1</a>), angular cheilitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55357\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55357 \">picture 3</a>), or koilonychia (spoon nails) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86418\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86418 \">picture 5</a>). The complete blood count (CBC) may be normal or show microcytic, hypochromic anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64267 \">picture 7</a>) with low red blood cell (RBC) and reticulocyte counts and an elevated platelet count. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of tests are available for evaluating iron status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109258\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109258 \">algorithm 1</a>). Serum ferritin is the most useful, especially in uncomplicated patients (eg, those without a chronic inflammatory state or multifactorial anemia). Ferritin is often measured together with the serum iron and transferrin (TIBC) and the percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) is calculated. (See <a href=\"#H3279977048\" class=\"local\">'Overview of evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Iron studies (list of available tests)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A serum ferritin level &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is considered confirmatory for iron deficiency at any hemoglobin concentration, and a serum ferritin level &lt;41 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is considered confirmatory for iron deficiency anemia in an individual with a low hemoglobin concentration. (See <a href=\"#H4154468675\" class=\"local\">'Individuals without comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More complex patients may require additional testing including TSAT, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) or sTfR-ferritin index, or bone marrow iron stain. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Patients with inconclusive initial testing or comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A response to a therapeutic trial of iron administration may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. Lack of a response may be due to an alternative diagnosis or to conditions such as celiac disease or <em>H. pylori</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H1232968741\" class=\"local\">'Response to a therapeutic trial of iron'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H2970995900\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Approaches to lack of response'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia should have a thorough history and examination for possible causes of the deficiency, which may precede the final diagnosis. Those with confirmed iron deficiency for whom a cause is not obvious should have additional evaluations that may include endoscopy or testing for <em>H. pylori</em> or celiac disease, especially individuals age 50 or older and those who do not have a response to iron repletion. (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Search for source of blood and iron loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of iron deficiency includes a number of other causes of fatigue, pica, and restless legs syndrome. The major conditions in the differential diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia include thalassemias, sideroblastic anemias, and the anemia of chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/anemia</span> of chronic disease.
