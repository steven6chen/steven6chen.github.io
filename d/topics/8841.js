For the mother, episodes of drug withdrawal during pregnancy and illnesses related to high-risk behavior may occur. Consequences for the offspring exposed to prenatal substance use disorder include neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) or other neurobehavioral effects that present shortly after birth, potential congenital malformations, low birth weight (BW) for gestational age (GA) (intrauterine growth restriction [IUGR]), prematurity, and long-term adverse effects on growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-of-mothers-with-substance-use-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, these infants are placed at increased risk due to the mother's poor prenatal care and are at higher risk of being exposed to prenatally acquired infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-of-mothers-with-substance-use-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical features and management of neonates born to mothers with substance use disorders will be reviewed here.

Infants with prenatal exposure to drugs of substance use disorder are also at risk for prematurity or IUGR, which adds additional challenges for accurate determination of gestational age (GA) and whether birth weight (BW) is appropriate for gestation. Prematurity and IUGR may be directly related to the specific drug (such as cocaine and nicotine) or may be indirect due to other related variables, such as inadequate nutrition, that are more likely to occur in women with substance use disorder. Prematurity and IUGR increase morbidity and mortality in affected infants compared with term infants born with appropriate size for gestational age (AGA).

Prenatal barbiturate exposure is associated with both neonatal withdrawal symptoms and congenital malformations. Exposed infants are usually full term and appropriate weight for gestational age (GA). The teratogenic effect of barbiturates is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks associated with epilepsy and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Effect of antiseizure drugs on the fetus'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> withdrawal is not known. If withdrawal occurs, symptoms present at a median age of seven days of life (range 2 to 14 days). Withdrawal has been separated into two stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-of-mothers-with-substance-use-disorder/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute stage &ndash; Irritability, constant crying, sleeplessness, tremors, hiccups, and mouthing motions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute stage &ndash; Voracious appetite, frequent regurgitation, gagging, episodic irritability, sweating, sleep disturbances, and increased sensitivity to sound. This stage may last from two to four months and is due to the slow metabolism and excretion of barbiturates by the neonate.</p><p/><p>Treatment is initially supportive with an emphasis on decreasing sensory stimuli (eg, quiet and darkened room, and swaddling) and frequent feedings.</p><p>If there is no improvement with supportive care, pharmacologic therapy should be considered. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Phenobarbital</a> is the preferred agent. Plasma phenobarbital concentrations of 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> appear to adequately control signs of withdrawal. To achieve this level, a loading dose of 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is given to the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-of-mothers-with-substance-use-disorder/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. The phenobarbital concentration is measured and additional adjustment of dosing (ie, additional administration or withholding of phenobarbital) is made based on the concentration. Once the targeted phenobarbital concentration is achieved, maintenance doses of 2 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per 24 hours are required to maintain plasma phenobarbital concentrations and control withdrawal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-of-mothers-with-substance-use-disorder/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">POLYDRUG USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most mothers who are identified as using one drug of substance use disorder are likely to have used other drugs during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-of-mothers-with-substance-use-disorder/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In the United States, it is estimated that cigarettes, alcohol, and illicit drugs were used 17.6, 9.4, and 5 percent, respectively, of pregnant women in 2011. Mothers, especially those who use illicit drugs, likely use or misuse more than one substance. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Polydrug use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of prenatal substance exposure is based on a positive maternal history or screening, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> identification of a drug or its metabolites in either a maternal or neonatal urine specimen. If there is a negative result or absence of maternal screening, neonatal screening is indicated if maternal or infant characteristics known to be associated with maternal substance use disorder are present. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the consent process for neonatal screening and the legal implications of a positive result vary among the states. The clinician needs to be aware of the local laws and changes that affect infants with prenatal drug exposure and their mothers. (See <a href=\"#H457621567\" class=\"local\">'Urine screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of infants with in utero drug exposure is variable and is dependent on the drug(s), timing, and amount of the last maternal use, genetic factors, and maternal and infant metabolism and excretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of comprehensive care for the dyad is important in the postnatal period, which is optimally provided by a multidisciplinary team that includes social services, drug counselors, obstetricians, and pediatricians. General care measures include assessment of the mother's history, as comorbidities are not uncommon in this population (eg, victims of violence including sexual abuse and psychiatric disorders), parental support and education, optimizing the environment for dyad interaction and self-regulation, and determining the infant's gestational age and appropriateness of birth weight. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of the drug and the timing of last maternal use may help to determine the likelihood and timing of neonatal withdrawal (eg, opioids) or duration of direct toxic effects (eg, cocaine). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are associated with prenatal exposure to smoking, alcohol, opioids, amphetamines, and cocaine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many drugs of substance use disorder are excreted into breast milk and if present can have negative effects on nursing infants. These include amphetamine, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, alcohol, and phencyclidine. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated in stable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a> or buprenorphine-maintained women who meet other criteria. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal withdrawal occurs in infants with prenatal exposure to opioids, barbiturates, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alcohol, and other substances, such as nicotine and benzodiazepines, can augment the withdrawal display. Initial care is supportive and includes decreasing sensory stimuli and providing adequate caloric intake for the infant's increased metabolic needs. Pharmacologic therapy is used if the infant continues to have significant withdrawal symptoms despite supportive care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-abstinence-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal abstinence syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Barbiturates'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with prenatal cocaine exposure may exhibit neurobehavioral abnormalities that usually present between 48 and 72 hours of life. These include tremors, high-pitched cry, irritability, hyperalertness, and episodes of apnea or tachypnea. These symptoms appear to be due to a direct effect of cocaine rather than withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Cocaine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term sequelae, especially poor neurodevelopmental outcome, are seen in infants with prenatal exposure to alcohol and barbiturates. These drugs are also teratogens and prenatal exposure to either drug may result in a recognized syndromic constellation of congenital malformations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks associated with epilepsy and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Effect of antiseizure drugs on the fetus'</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is uncertain whether other drugs of substance use disorder (eg, cocaine and opioids) are associated with poor long-term outcome. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cigarette smoking'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Cocaine'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-abstinence-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal abstinence syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-of-mothers-with-substance-use-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bada HS, Das A, Bauer CR, et al.
