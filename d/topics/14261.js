The Institute of Medicine estimates that the incidence of poisoning in the United States is approximately 4 million cases per year, with 300,000 cases leading to hospitalization and approximately 30,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 2003 to 2004, poisoning accounted for 18 percent of all injury deaths and 10 percent of hospital discharges for injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Poisoning is a significant public health issue for children. Each year in the United States, more than 1 million poison exposures among children younger than six years of age are reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. In addition, approximately 130,000 to 140,000 exposures are reported for children 6 to 12 years and 150,000 to 170,000 exposures for teenagers 13 to 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Because not all poisoning exposures are reported to poison control centers, these numbers are most likely an underestimate.</p><p>Over 90 percent of poisoning exposures occur in homes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. The pattern of poisonings varies by age and sex. For preadolescents, poisoning occurs slightly more often in males than females, but this trend reverses in teenagers, with approximately 60 percent of all poisonings in the 13- to 19-year age group occurring in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of poisonings involving young children are classified as unintentional (eg, exploratory ingestions, therapeutic errors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In contrast, more than one-half of poisoning exposures involving teenagers are intentional (60 percent in 2016) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poisoning exposure typically causes minor symptoms in young children; death is a relatively rare occurrence.

Based on national surveillance between 2007 and 2011, it is estimated that nearly 9500 children younger than six years are hospitalized each year for unsupervised ingestion of prescription medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Opioids (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">buprenorphine</a>) and benzodiazepines were the most commonly ingested medications. Among children who presented to the emergency department with unsupervised medication exposure between 2010 and 2013, opioids and benzodiazepines were the most commonly ingested prescription solids; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>, cough and cold remedies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diphenhydramine</a> were the most commonly ingested liquid over-the-counter medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Child self-exposure to electronic cigarettes also appears to be increasing.

It was derived through analysis of more than 3.8 million exposures that were reported to the AAPCC from 1985 through 1989 among children younger than six years.

Of the more than 2 million poisoning exposures reported to United States poison control centers in 2016, 67 percent were managed at a nonhealth care facility, which was usually the site of exposure, primarily the home of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately 85 percent of cases in children &lt;13 years were managed outside a health care facility. In contrast, approximately 60 percent of cases in teenagers and 50 percent of cases in adults (&ge;20 years) required management in a medical facility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost to society</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poisoning is a financial burden to society. Medical spending for poisoning treatment surpassed $3 billion in 1992 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Numerous studies have shown that poison control centers reduce health care spending. Poison control centers provide a mechanism for safe management of most poisonings at home, expedite referral to a health care facility when necessary, decrease unnecessary emergency department visits, and reduce hospital length of stay for patients with poison exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>]. One study estimated that the average public call to a poison control center in 1992 saved $175 in other medical spending [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The authors estimated that every $1 spent on poison control center activities saved approximately $6.50 in medical costs. This is likely an underestimate of the benefits of poison control centers, in that it does not take into account decreased morbidity and mortality, or the reduction in parental anxiety and saved time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age and sex are factors to consider in evaluating a child or adolescent's risk for poisoning.

Preschool children, who typically understand the concept of danger and can understand and follow simple rules, may become victims of poisoning if left unsupervised. In addition, the impulsivity of some children puts them at even greater risk for poisoning.</p><p>Developmental issues and pressures also contribute to the increased risk of poisoning among adolescents. The goal of independence and the tendency to believe that they are indestructible may cause adolescents to take undue risks in experimenting with illicit drugs, other substances of abuse, or potentially dangerous fads (eg, the &quot;cinnamon challenge&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Peer pressure and desire to conform also contribute to this problem. In addition, teenagers (more commonly girls than boys) may take an overdose of medication as a suicide attempt or gesture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This may be related to an acute personal crisis or a reflection of more chronic issues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal behavior in children and adolescents: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental factors also contribute to poisoning events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Most homes contain numerous potentially toxic substances, particularly in the kitchen (eg, dishwasher detergent <span class=\"nowrap\">packets/pods),</span> bathrooms, laundry room (eg, laundry detergent pods), and garage. Items used frequently, such as cleaning products, may be stored in low cabinets for easy access. Some products are so commonly used and seem so familiar that parents may not appreciate their toxicity. The risks of laundry and dishwasher detergent pods are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caustic esophageal injury in children&quot;, section on 'Esophageal injury'</a>.)</p><p>Products or medications that are used or taken frequently may be stored properly, but during use may be left momentarily within a child's reach (eg, medication organizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]). Child self-exposure accounted for 95 percent of visits to a health care facility for evaluation of exposure to a potentially toxic dose of a pharmaceutical agent reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers between 2001 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Look-alikes also pose a problem for small children. Some medications look identical to candy. Similarly, some cleaning products may look like or be stored in containers that resemble those of food or juice. The availability of medications, drugs, or other substances of abuse at school or home may put vulnerable teenagers at further risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most poisonings that occur in young children are unintentional. Though sometimes referred to as &quot;accidental,&quot; the preferred term in the injury prevention literature is &quot;unintentional&quot; because the term &quot;accident&quot; implies a random, uncontrollable act of fate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Poisonings, like other types of injuries, are understandable, predictable, and preventable events. Active areas of research include better understanding of poisoning events, strategies to reduce the frequency of poisonings, and improvement of services and treatment when poisonings occur.</p><p>Prevention strategies for poisonings, as for other types of injury, can be divided into primary (pre-event), secondary (event), and tertiary (post-event) prevention strategies. As a general rule, primary passive intervention strategies (eg, legislation that limits the dose of baby <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> per container) are more effective than active intervention strategies (educating parents to keep baby aspirin out of the reach of children). Educational efforts have been shown to change safety-related knowledge and behavior (eg, displaying the poison control telephone number) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-36</a>]. However, direct evidence that educational counseling results in lower injury rates is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Secondary prevention strategies are mentioned briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere.

Between 1960 and 1980, deaths from aspirin dropped from 144 to 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1970, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) required child-resistant packaging for certain types of opiates and other dangerous drugs, drain cleaners and oven cleaners, lighter fluid, turpentine, and a variety of solvents and other household products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Child-resistant containers separate the child from the toxic product by imposing a physical barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-poisoning-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The particular physical barrier is not necessarily childproof but is designed to delay the child's ability to open the container long enough for an adult to discover the child before ingestion can occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The PPPA has been one of the most important achievements in poisoning prevention.
