One of the advantages of EUS is the ability to apply the ultrasound transducer directly against the luminal surface, which minimizes intervening adipose tissue and air between the transducer and the target tissue, thereby enhancing image quality. The proximity of the transducer to the target tissue also permits the use of higher frequency ultrasound, which further contributes to the enhanced image resolution. As a result, EUS is used routinely in the evaluation of numerous gastrointestinal disorders, including the diagnosis and staging of gastrointestinal tumors. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p>The technical evolution of EUS has lead to the development of small caliber intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) miniprobes (about 2 mm), which can be passed through standard endoscopes directly into the bile or pancreatic duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69099\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69099 \">picture 1</a>). The small caliber, flexibility, and excellent image quality produced by these catheters makes them ideal for evaluating a variety of biliary and pancreatic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74332 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the role of IDUS in the evaluation of several pancreatic and hepatobiliary disorders. The role of standard EUS instruments in the evaluation of these conditions is presented separately. (See appropriate topic reviews.) The role of miniprobes for evaluation of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract is also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-frequency-catheter-endoscopic-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-frequency catheter endoscopic ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) is capable of producing better image resolution than standard endoscopic ultrasound (EUS; 0.07 to 0.18 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Acoustic coupling is optimized by the tubular anatomy of the pancreatic and bile ducts, which are fluid filled and only slightly larger in caliber than the probe itself. In addition, the probes operate at higher frequencies (12 to 30 MHz) than standard EUS, which leads to higher image resolution.</p><p>Three systems are available to perform IDUS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70245\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70245 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electronic cylindrical phased array</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined probe (allows both radial and linear scanning)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical radial sector scan system</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Electronic systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electronic systems use thin catheters (diameter 1.1 mm, 3.5 French), have no rotating parts, and are extremely flexible. These probes contain a ring of 64 transducer elements that produce a 360&ordm; image. The transducer ring detects the signals from the tissue and transmits them via microwires to the image processor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical probes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Components of mechanical probes include a single transducer, a wire to rotate the transducer, a cable that excites the transducer and transfers signals to the image processor, and a flexible protective housing. The rotating transducer is mounted on the tip of the wire and produces a 360&ordm; image.</p><p>Design variations exist for these catheter systems, some of which permit the use of a guidewire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79640\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79640 \">picture 2</a>). Single use probes are available in which a constant connection exists between the cable and the housing; the transducer rotates in a water-filled chamber whereas the shaft of the housing is free of fluid. Another multi-purpose catheter is available that requires insertion of the cable and transducer into a water-filled housing that may contain a distally attached balloon over the region of the transducer. This protective housing and balloon attachment helps minimize near field artifacts and reduces resistance during transducer rotation. Their design allows multiple uses and reduces the cost of this technology. Newer mechanical probes that permit mechanical rotating sector scanning and linear scanning have also been developed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">BILIARY TRACT INTRADUCTAL ULTRASOUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) can assist in the evaluation of patients with a variety of biliary tract disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74332 \">table 1</a>). The most common indications for IDUS of the biliary tract include the evaluation of choledocholithiasis and obstructive jaundice. IDUS is useful for determining the cause of biliary obstruction and can also assist in local tumor staging.</p><p>In contrast to endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), IDUS is often better able to evaluate the proximal biliary system and surrounding structures, such as the right hepatic artery, portal vein, and the hepatoduodenal ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61520\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61520 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74347\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74347 \">image 2</a>). Examination of more distant tissues is hindered by its limited depth of penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. IDUS may also have limited value in evaluating lymph nodes, and unlike EUS, IDUS cannot be used to perform fine needle aspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The IDUS catheter can be inserted into the bile duct through an endoscopic or percutaneous approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was required in approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients undergoing IDUS during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in initial reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. New small caliber IDUS catheters permit cannulation without the need for sphincterotomy in almost all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>]. Severely stenotic strictures may require dilation with a catheter or balloon. The IDUS procedure time, including catheter insertion and imaging time, adds approximately 5 to 10 minutes to the duration of standard ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. Complications attributed directly to IDUS are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/11,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,15</a>].</p><p>The normal bile duct appears as either two or three layers, which is similar to that seen during standard EUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/7,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16-18</a>]. The normal bile duct wall is 0.31 to 0.79 mm thick, with smooth inner and outer surfaces and homogeneous internal echoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. When visualized as a two-layer structure, an internal hypoechoic layer is seen which represents the mucosa, muscularis propria (fibromuscular layer), and fibrous layer of the subserosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. An outer hyperechoic layer represents the adipose layer of the subserosa, the serosa, and the interface echo between the serosa and surrounding organs. A third inner hyperechoic layer, representing an interface, will occasionally be identified. It may not be possible to differentiate the fibromuscular layer from the perimuscular connective tissue in some patients in whom they appear as a single hypoechoic layer. This limits the ability to differentiate between T1 and T2 bile duct cancers, although this distinction is usually not clinically relevant when considering treatment options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Choledocholithiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of imaging modalities are available to evaluate patients with suspected choledocholithiasis, including transabdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, ERCP, and EUS. (See appropriate topic reviews.) Initial studies have suggested a role for IDUS in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis who have normal cholangiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report included 62 patients who were suspected to have bile duct stones who underwent cholangiography and IDUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The presence of bile duct stones or sludge was confirmed after sphincterotomy. Overall, the combination of cholangiography plus IDUS was significantly more accurate than cholangiography alone for diagnosing bile duct stones (97 versus 87 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report included 31 patients with choledocholithiasis who underwent transabdominal ultrasonography, ERCP, and IDUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. All patients underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone removal to confirm the presence of bile duct stones. Wire-guided insertion of the IDUS catheter was possible in all patients. The sensitivity of IDUS was superior to ERCP and transabdominal ultrasonography (97 versus 81 and 45 percent, respectively). In the one patient in whom IDUS was falsely negative, the stone had migrated proximally into the left intrahepatic bile duct while only the right hepatic duct had been examined. A protocol requiring more complete bilateral examination may have permitted stone visualization. The sensitivity of IDUS over the other techniques was even higher for detecting small stones (&lt;5 mm) and for determining the number of stones. IDUS reliably distinguished stones from sludge and air bubbles and there were no complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third report focused on 65 patients with suspected choledocholithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. IDUS successfully identified all stones in 59 patients in whom choledocholithiasis was confirmed. Two false positive diagnoses were made in the remaining six patients, giving an overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100, 67, and 97 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a fourth report, IDUS was performed in 35 patients with suspected choledocholithiasis with equivocal findings on cholangiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Of 21 patients with apparent normal cholangiography, eight (38 percent) had stones or sludge detected by IDUS. All of these patients subsequently underwent sphincterotomy, which confirmed the presence of sludge or stones in seven. In contrast, IDUS permitted avoidance of sphincterotomy in five patients in whom a suspected stone on cholangiography was shown to be an air bubble by IDUS. Overall IDUS led to a change in clinical management in 13 patients (37 percent). However, the high rate of residual stones and sludge observed in this study compared with previous reports raise questions regarding the quality of the cholangiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Furthermore, the clinical significance of the residual sludge and stones is unclear since some of these may have been small enough to pass spontaneously.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Conclusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IDUS can demonstrate common duct stones in patients suspected of having choledocholithiasis in whom stones are not visualized by other imaging modalities.
