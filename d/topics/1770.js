Pain is controlled with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> elixir. Incentive spirometry is encouraged to reduce atelectasis. Oxygen is administered by nasal cannula in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and weaned thereafter. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea are managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-and-long-term-management-of-the-uncomplicated-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Patients are typically maintained with nil per os (NPO) and intravenous fluids.

Surgeons who routinely await radiologic confirmation of anastomotic integrity before starting a diet contend that clinical signs may not predict a leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-and-long-term-management-of-the-uncomplicated-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and that routine imaging may identify a leak earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-and-long-term-management-of-the-uncomplicated-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].
