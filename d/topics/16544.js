They work by stimulating insulin secretion so are useful only in patients with some beta cell function.</p><p>The sulfonylurea receptor is a component of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel (K-ATP channel) in the pancreatic beta cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonylureas-and-meglitinides-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The K-ATP channel regulates the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Sulfonylurea binding leads to inhibition of these channels, which alters the resting potential of the cell, leading to calcium influx and stimulation of insulin secretion. The net effect is increased responsiveness of beta cells to both glucose and non-glucose secretagogues (such as amino acids), resulting in more insulin being released at all blood glucose concentrations. Sulfonylureas may also have extrapancreatic effects, one of which is to increase tissue sensitivity to insulin, but the clinical importance of these effects is minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonylureas-and-meglitinides-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The K-ATP channel is a functional complex of the sulfonylurea 1 receptor (SUR1) and an inward rectifier potassium channel subunit Kir6.2. Mutations in either the <em>SUR1</em> gene or the Kir6.2 gene lead to the loss of K-ATP activity; as a result, the cell is persistently depolarized, resulting in calcium influx, high cytosolic calcium concentrations, and the release of insulin, producing a syndrome called persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mutations in the Kir6.2, and to a lesser extent, the <em>SUR1</em> gene, have also been identified that activate the K-ATP channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonylureas-and-meglitinides-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Activating mutations increase the number of open K-ATP channels at the plasma membrane, hyperpolarizing the beta cells and preventing the release of insulin. These mutations have been found in patients with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus; insulin secretion in these patients can be restored with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glyburide-glibenclamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glyburide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonylureas-and-meglitinides-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

They have structural characteristics that allow them to be given in much lower doses than the first-generation sulfonylureas. Nevertheless, the different sulfonylureas are equally effective in lowering blood glucose concentrations. There are, however, differences in absorption and metabolism, as well as in effective dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56701 \">table 1</a>). Comparison of plasma half-lives is misleading since the biological effect is often much longer. For example, the hypoglycemic action of glyburide can last for more than 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonylureas-and-meglitinides-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] due in part to the formation of active metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonylureas-and-meglitinides-in-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

They cause greater suppression of overnight hepatic glucose output, thereby lowering fasting blood glucose concentrations relatively more than shorter-acting agents.
