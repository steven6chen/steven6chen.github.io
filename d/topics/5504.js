These included pre-renal transplant sensitization regimens; HLA-matched or family member apheresis-harvested platelet concentrates for refractory, thrombocytopenic patients; and washed maternal platelets for infants with isoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia.</p><p>In direct response to concerns about blood safety raised by the AIDS epidemic, directed donations increased dramatically after 1985, despite official discouragement by all of the major blood banking organizations. Currently, directed donations constitute less than 1 percent of all blood collected, a figure that seems to be stable. While any blood component (red blood cells, plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets or granulocytes) can be directed towards a particular patient, the vast majority of directed donations are for red blood cells.</p><p>This topic covers issues specifically related to directed blood donation. The safety of blood donation for the donor, and the risks and benefits of any blood transfusion are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Procedures and processes to enhance safety for the blood recipient and the blood donor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Administration and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusions in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY OF DIRECTED BLOOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the early reluctance to provide directed donations, which centered on administrative and logistical concerns, has been overcome as directed donation programs are now no more complex to administer than are autologous transfusion programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24435857\"><span class=\"h2\">No difference in infectious disease risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More substantive concerns about the relative safety of directed donor blood as compared with community, volunteer blood are now addressable with data accumulated by the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Studies (REDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/directed-designated-blood-donation-programs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These data were collected at five geographically and demographically diverse blood centers under the sponsorship of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Seropositivity for various infectious disease markers was measured in 30,778 first-time directed donors and compared with 384,276 first-time (allogeneic) community donors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no significant differences in the prevalence of three of the five markers: anti-HIV-1 and HIV-2, anti-HCV, and a serologic test for syphilis (STS).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Directed donors had a significantly higher prevalence of positive tests for anti-HTLV-I (relative risk 2.32) and HBsAg (relative risk 1.99).</p><p/><p>Further analysis of the REDS data indicated that essentially all differences between directed and community donors were explained by differences in the demographics of the two groups (age, sex, ethnic group, etc). The authors concluded that directed donors were no less safe simply because they were donating specifically for a friend or relative. Previous data comparing the prevalence of positive tests in directed donors (60 to 70 percent of whom were first-time donors) to community, volunteer donors (a much lower percentage of whom were first-time donors) were flawed because of the incomparability of the two groups.</p><p>In summary, blood from directed donors is neither safer nor measurably less safe than blood from community, volunteer donors. Furthermore, there is an increased administrative cost associated with this procedure. As a result, we do <strong>not</strong> generally recommend directed donation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks with future pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is prudent to avoid using a man's blood for his female partner if she is capable of and desirous of bearing children. In this setting, the woman may become sensitized to her partner's red cell or platelet antigens, possibly leading to hemolytic disease or thrombocytopenia in the newborn if the fetus and father have red cell or platelet antigens lacking in the mother. This consideration should in most circumstances outweigh the fact that the blood from a spousal donor may carry a reduced risk to the recipient given that the recipient is likely to have exposure to other body fluids from the spouse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal diagnosis and management of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn&quot;, section on 'Types of HDFN'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938919\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's physician should be responsible for requesting directed donations and should be kept informed as to the status of all blood collected. Designated donors, as well as the intended recipient, should be completely informed regarding the details of the directed donor program, particularly such issues as confidentiality, potential risks and benefits, and possible use of the blood for other than the intended recipient (if necessary). Informed consent should be obtained, preferably from both donor and recipient.</p><p>Each institution offering directed donations should determine whether or not it is willing, prior to collecting the blood, to perform red cell typing of potential directed donors to determine if the blood is compatible with the recipient. Given a number of logistical and cost concerns, most community blood centers discourage this practice.</p><p>Designated donors must meet all the criteria for protection of the recipient that are used for community volunteer donors, and they must be aware that their blood will be subjected to the same battery of infectious disease tests used to screen volunteer blood. (See <a href=\"#H24435938\" class=\"local\">'Testing of blood for directed donation'</a> below.)</p><p>Designated donors should also be aware that blood not used by the intended recipient may be made available to others. (See <a href=\"#H24435995\" class=\"local\">'Directed donation that is not used'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency of donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with allogeneic donors, directed donors should be restricted to donation schedules that meet US Food and Drug Administration and AABB guidelines in which there are at least eight weeks between whole blood donations. Compressed schedules, appropriate for autologous donors, are generally not applicable to directed donors. One potential exception occurs when, in the opinion of the medical director, a component of truly enhanced safety can be provided by the designated donor (as with parent to infant or HLA-matched sibling to sibling). With repeated transfusion from a parent to an infant, for example, small quantities of relatively fresh blood are required at stable intervals. In this setting, it may be prudent to draw less than full units at shorter intervals than the current eight-week standard. This approach is recommended because it protects the donor from iron depletion and the recipient from exposure to multiple donors.</p><p>With the establishment of newer, automated technology, directed donors can, if otherwise eligible based on (gender-specific) body size, donate dual red blood cell units, thereby doubling the contribution of red blood cells from a donor without the need for a compressed donation schedule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dedicated donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The compelling argument that reducing donor exposure enhances transfusion safety has encouraged some to suggest a new classification of donor that is a variation of a directed donor, a so-called &quot;dedicated&quot; donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/directed-designated-blood-donation-programs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Dedicated donors are committed to providing repeated donations of specific components for a single recipient, thereby reducing or obviating the need for that patient to receive components from multiple donors. While no allowances have been made in the standards for blood banking and transfusion medicine published by the AABB to enable dedicated donors to donate more frequently, this regimen is gaining in popularity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing between donation and transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Directed donor blood cannot be used for emergency transfusion, given the need to collect and test the blood. With exceedingly rare exceptions, directed donor blood should not be made available for transfusion until completely tested. Since complete testing usually takes approximately 48 hours (and one should also factor in time for paperwork, delivery of the blood to the hospital, and perhaps time to seek a replacement donor should the first donor be disqualified for any reason), it would make sense to have directed donors' blood drawn approximately one week prior to a scheduled elective surgical procedure. If everything were to work to perfection, and the primary intended donor's blood be made available for transfusion, 48 to 72 hours would be the shortest time frame in which this could occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24435938\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing of blood for directed donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Directed donor blood undergoes all of the same screening procedures used for anonymous volunteer donation. Screening includes a thorough blood donor medical history as well as laboratory testing. With exceedingly rare exceptions (perhaps when a parent is donating for <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> child and has a non-significant positive viral marker such as anti-HBc), directed donor blood that has a positive infectious disease screening test is discarded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Procedures and processes to enhance safety for the blood recipient and the blood donor&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Directed donors are also accorded the same patient confidentiality protections as any patient; thus, if screening reveals an infectious or other risk, the recipient will not be notified. (See <a href=\"#H938919\" class=\"local\">'Informed consent'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24435995\"><span class=\"h2\">Directed donation that is not used</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thorough screening of the donor and donated blood allows blood not used by the intended recipient to be made available for others. Crossover of directed donor blood is common practice, although there are some collection facilities that discard unused directed donor blood. This differs from autologous blood donations, which generally are not released to other recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation#H25011227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation&quot;, section on 'Crossover (release to other recipients)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD IRRADIATION WITH RELATED DONORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1989, attention was drawn to one of the potential adverse consequences of receiving blood from related donors: development of often fatal transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/directed-designated-blood-donation-programs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This can occur in fully immunocompetent individuals, and it is most likely to occur when the donor is homozygous for an HLA haplotype shared with the recipient. Subsequent reports confirmed this relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/directed-designated-blood-donation-programs/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], prompting the AABB to require irradiation of all donor units drawn from a blood relative of the intended recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/directed-designated-blood-donation-programs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
