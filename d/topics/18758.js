The microbiology of vulvar abscesses is discussed in this section; Bartholin gland abscesses are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bartholin gland masses: Diagnosis and management&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>The vulvar skin is colonized with organisms found on the skin and in the vagina and rectum. Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative enteric organisms are commonly isolated from vulvar abscesses. Anaerobic bacteria, such as Peptostreptococcus or beta-lactamase-producing anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides fragilis) may also be present in this polymicrobial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-abscess/abstract/6,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14</a>]. </p><p>Methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) is the most common pathogen among vulvar abscesses that require incision and drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-abscess/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There are no data regarding abscesses that do not require incision and drainage, since they are rarely cultured. The largest case series of vulvar abscesses included 162 women at a county hospital in Texas who underwent incision and drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. MRSA was isolated in 64 percent of cases; the remaining cultures grew &quot;usual vaginal flora,&quot; including group B streptococci, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and Enterococcus species.</p><p>The results of this study are consistent with other United States studies showing that MRSA is often present in cultures of the perineum taken during routine obstetric care and that MRSA is the most common cause of skin and soft tissue infections at other body sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-abscess/abstract/9-11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11,15,16</a>]. The rate of female genital colonization with MRSA in other countries is unknown. Athletes, military recruits, and children in day care are at increased risk for MRSA skin infections. Other risk factors include injection drug use and poor hygiene. A case series of three families suggests that heterosexual contact may be a risk for MRSA genital infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-abscess/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>There is no evidence of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> or <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> in vulvar abscesses other than Bartholin gland abscesses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of vulvar abscesses other than Bartholin gland abscesses is unknown. </p><p>Many women with vulvar abscesses have no apparent risk factors.

Pain beyond local tenderness is not typically associated with a vulvar abscess and, particularly in immunocompromised women, may raise suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections#H2371333042\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p>There are few data regarding how often vulvar abscess is accompanied by fever. In one study, fewer than 10 percent of women with vulvar abscesses had an associated temperature &ge;100.4 F [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of vulvar abscess is based on the finding on physical examination of a tender, often fluctuant vulvar mass with surrounding erythema and possible edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> induration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60868\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60868 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-abscess/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15317659\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vital signs are measured to assess for fever and hemodynamic stability, particularly in women who report fever, are ill-appearing, or are immunocompromised. </p><p>The site of the suspected vulvar abscess is examined. The vulva should be visually inspected and the mass palpated. Signs consistent with an abscess (tender mass, fluctuance, erythema, edema, induration) should be noted. The size of the abscess should be measured and documented; this information is useful to assess response to therapy. The extent of the mass should be assessed by visualization of any vaginal component with a speculum examination and with palpation of the mass with a bimanual pelvic examination. Any mass that does not have findings typical for an abscess should be evaluated further, as appropriate (see <a href=\"#H15317614\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15317701\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the increasing prevalence of resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, aerobic and anaerobic cultures should routinely be collected. Since vulvar abscesses other than Bartholin gland abscesses are not caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia, testing for these infections is not part of the evaluation. Cultures are collected after the initial incision in abscesses that require incision and drainage and by needle aspiration at the leading edge of cellulitis if no incision is planned.</p><p>Laboratory evaluation to evaluate for bacteremia and sepsis is required in the few women who develop systemic illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood cultures for the detection of bacteremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15317713\"><span class=\"h3\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic data do not generally contribute to the diagnosis since the extent of the abscess is typically palpable on examination. The extent of deeper abscesses is evaluated during incision and drainage. In the pediatric population, however, some experts use translabial ultrasound to differentiate cellulitis from a drainable abscess. This may be helpful in avoiding an unnecessary operative procedure. </p><p>Biopsy of the lesion is appropriate for women in whom malignancy is suspected. It is generally recommended that women over age 40 with a Bartholin cyst or abscess undergo drainage and biopsy of the gland to exclude the possibility of an underlying carcinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management#H363592216\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bartholin gland masses: Diagnosis and management&quot;, section on 'Bartholin gland carcinoma'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15317614\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of a vulvar abscess includes infectious and noninfectious vulvar masses and lesions. Abscesses are generally singular and present as a palpable mass rather than an ulcer or flat lesion (macule, patch, plaque) and may begin small, but are larger than a papule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis based on morphology&quot;</a>.) &#160; </p><p>Other infections of the vulva include vulvovaginitis, which does not present with a mass or rarely presents with erythema. Genital herpes simplex infection causes painful papules, but these are too small to be abscesses. Necrotizing fasciitis, although rare, should be suspected in a woman who has a vulvar abscess <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent vulvar pain combined with erythema or induration (see <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Necrotizing fasciitis'</a> below). </p><p>Noninfectious masses are typically nontender and nonerythematous (eg, Bartholin gland cyst, epidermoid cyst). Notable exceptions to this are vulvar nodules due to hidradenitis suppurativa, which are painful and often progress to form an abscess. Vulvar cancer may present as a firm mass or lesion with surrounding erythema. A biopsy should be performed if there is suspicion of a cancer or precancerous lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2874755\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of vulvar abscess depends upon the lesion size and the patient's risk factors for failure of therapy or systemic infection. The general principles of management are the same regardless of the type of vulvar abscess.</p><p>Small lesions often resolve with conservative therapy (eg, warm compresses); however, incision and drainage is the mainstay of treatment of vulvar abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-abscess/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>]. Antibiotics are required in some cases (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2874722\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions that are appropriate for conservative therapy (eg, warm compresses) may be treated by any primary care clinician (see <a href=\"#H2874343\" class=\"local\">'Conservative therapy'</a> below). Incision and drainage requires a clinician who has experience with vulvar procedures.</p><p>Consultation with an advanced pelvic surgeon may be required if the abscess extends into the mons pubis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> into the medial aspect of the thigh or if necrotizing fasciitis is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2873935\"><span class=\"h2\">Small abscesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first line of therapy for most women with a small vulvar abscess (&lt;2 cm) is conservative therapy (eg, warm compresses or sitz baths). Antibiotic therapy may be used in combination with conservative measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2874343\"><span class=\"h3\">Conservative therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small vulvar abscesses (&lt;2 cm) that have yet to point to the skin surface (&quot;come to a head&quot;) are treated with warm compresses or sitz baths three to four times per day. If the lesion does not resolve after a week or if the lesion points to the skin's surface, incision and drainage will hasten resolution.</p><p>For immunocompromised women, conservative management should be used <strong>only</strong> for abscesses that are too small for incision and drainage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2874507\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics combined with conservative therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment of a small vulvar abscess with conservative therapy alone is reasonable.

Occasionally, a vulvar abscess will require extensive debridement in an inpatient setting. When extensive debridement is anticipated, an experienced pelvic surgeon should perform the procedure.</p><p>Inpatient incision and drainage under regional or general anesthesia is preferred if an abscess is very large (&ge;5 cm), if there is suspicion that the abscess may extend to another anatomic compartment (eg, thigh, anterior abdominal wall), or in immunocompromised women. If there is a potential for post-drainage complications, we also admit the patient for postoperative observation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h4\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspects of incision and drainage specific to vulvar abscess are discussed here. General principles of incision and drainage of a skin abscess can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technique of incision and drainage for skin abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Incision and drainage of a vulvar abscess is performed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Local anesthetic is injected at the planned incision site and around the base of the abscess. A pudendal block is not recommended, since it does not anesthetize the anterior aspect of the perineum and is often ineffective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pudendal-and-paracervical-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pudendal and paracervical block&quot;</a>.). </p><p>For drainage of abscesses that are &ge;5 cm, the procedure may need to be performed under general anesthesia to ensure patient comfort and achieve adequate exposure.</p><p>An incision in the anterior-posterior axis of the vulva is preferred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78394\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78394 \">picture 2</a>). This optimizes exposure, since the anterior-posterior axis of the vulva is larger than the medial-lateral axis. In addition, during the healing process, there will be less tension on the incision, due to the normal forces during movement in the vulvar area.</p><p>The incision should extend the length of the indurated vulvar tissue. A generous incision is required to allow complete drainage and irrigation of the abscess. A small incision may be inadequate and result in a wound that is more difficult to pack postoperatively. &#160;</p><p>Abscess fluid and debrided material should be sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture and susceptibility testing. The base of the abscess should be debrided until all necrotic tissue has been removed. Consultation with an advanced pelvic surgeon may be required if the abscess extends into the mons pubis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> into the medial aspect of the thigh or if necrotizing fasciitis is suspected. </p><p>As with incision and drainage at other body sites, the defect should be drained, irrigated, and packed with gauze (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78394\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78394 \">picture 2</a>). This saline-soaked gauze is removed and replaced daily (&quot;wet to dry&quot;).</p><p>There are several options for wound management after and I&amp;D of a vulvar abscess. One option is wet to dry dressing changes, having the wound heal by secondary intention, from the base upward until the defect has healed and closed. The cavity becomes smaller and smaller with time, requiring less packing material. The patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family must be comfortable with changing the wet to dry dressings, or home health care must be arranged. Another option is to place sutures in the operating room, but not tie them. Initially, wet to dry dressing changes are done for approximately three to seven days.

We also treat these women with antibiotic therapy. Another reasonable approach is to initiate antibiotics in these women only if the lesion does not improve after two days.
