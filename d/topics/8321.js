It is the reason men have male sexual features, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair on the body and face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large, strong muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A deep, low voice</p><p/><p>Women make testosterone, too, but in much lower amounts than men.</p><p>Androgens can also be made in a lab and are called &quot;synthetic androgens.&quot; They are also called &quot;anabolic steroids,&quot; or just &quot;steroids.&quot;</p><p>Doctors sometimes prescribe testosterone to men whose bodies don't make enough. It is taken as an injection (shot), as a patch placed on the skin, or a gel rubbed into the skin.</p><p>Some people (mostly men, but sometimes women) take androgens or other hormones to build up their muscles and perform better in sports. But this can lead to serious side effects and other problems. Doctors do <strong>not</strong> recommend doing this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99569136\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different types of hormones to boost sports performance?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androgens and other hormones to boost sports performance include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone &ndash; This is the main androgen made by the body. Doctors agree that it is safe to give testosterone to men who cannot make a normal amount of testosterone on their own. For men with normal testosterone levels, taking extra hormone might help sports performance a little bit. But it can also be harmful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synthetic androgens &ndash; These include stanozolol and nandrolone, which come in pills (but can also be injected).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemicals that change into androgens in the body &ndash; These include androstenedione (also called &quot;andro&quot;) and DHEA. Androstenedione is available only by prescription. There is no proof that it makes your muscles stronger. DHEA pills are sold over-the-counter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SARMS &ndash; This stands for &quot;selective androgen receptor modulators.&quot; Many different SARMs are sold over the internet and claim to help build muscle. But they are not approved in any country. Many have also been found to have problems with their labeling. For example, they might contain substances other than what they say they contain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemicals that help the body make more testosterone &ndash; One example is human chorionic gonadotropin (also called hCG), a hormone women's bodies make when they are pregnant. Another is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tamoxifen</a>, a pill that blocks the female hormone estrogen. Male athletes use this to prevent breast growth when they are taking testosterone. That's because testosterone can turn into estrogen, which then makes the breasts grow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth hormone &ndash; This hormone normally helps the body grow and build muscle. Doctors prescribe it to people who don't make enough of it. But people who have normal amounts of growth hormone sometimes take extra to try to boost their performance. There is no proof that this works, and it can be harmful.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99569153\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the risks and side effects of hormones to boost sports performance?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androgens can cause the following side effects in both men and women:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood problems, such as acting aggressive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Too many red blood cells and a higher-than-normal risk of blood clots</p><p/><p>Other side effects happen to men, women, and teenagers differently:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men, androgens cause the testes to get smaller and stop making natural testosterone and sperm. This can be reversed if men stop taking androgens, but it can take a long time. They also cause men's breasts to grow (called &quot;gynecomastia&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women, androgens cause a deep voice and hair growth on the face and other parts of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In teenagers, androgens can cause the ends of certain bones to fuse together earlier than normal.</p><p/><p>In men, hCG can cause the breasts to swell and grow larger.</p><p>Growth hormone has many side effects, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An enlarged heart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand swelling</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99569168\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-treatment-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Growth hormone treatment in adults (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
