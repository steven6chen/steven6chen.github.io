Breastfeeding for all infants is strongly supported by both governmental and medical professional organizations because of its acknowledged benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The composition of human milk is both complex, containing multiple nutrients, and remarkable for its variability. As an example, the concentration of some nutrients may differ between women and according to duration of lactation or time of day, whereas the concentration of other nutrients is relatively constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The composition of human milk is ideally suited to the full-term infant. The ability to vary the content permits nutrient composition to be adapted to meet the ongoing needs of the infant. In addition, the lack of monotony in the diet may potentially stimulate sensory development and permit better acceptance of new flavors and foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Approximately 70 percent of the proteins in human milk are in the soluble whey fraction and 30 percent in the insoluble casein fraction. In contrast, bovine milk protein contains 18 percent whey and 82 percent casein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The high proportion of whey protein in human milk is beneficial for infants for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with casein, whey is more easily digested and is associated with more rapid gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The whey protein fraction provides lower concentrations of potentially deleterious amino acids, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and methionine.

In contrast, formula has &lt;5 percent nonprotein nitrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18</a>]. There is debate as to how much these nonprotein nitrogen-containing compounds contribute to nitrogen utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The rate of absorption of nonprotein nitrogen, determined by stable isotope methods, has been estimated at 13 to 43 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nucleotides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nucleotides represent 2 to 5 percent of the nonprotein nitrogen in human milk and are lacking in bovine milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nucleotides are important for gastrointestinal, immune, and metabolic functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. As an example, nucleotides are important for the normal development, maturation, and repair of the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, the growth of nonpathogenic bifidobacteria in stool is enhanced by exogenous nucleotides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although nucleotides can be synthesized endogenously, the rapid growth of infants creates a demand for nucleotides that exceeds their endogenous supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">LIPID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipid (fat) represents approximately 50 percent of the calories in human milk and is the major energy source. The fat requirement of a healthy term infant, using data from breastmilk composition, is approximately 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for the first six months of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62525 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Of the macronutrients in human milk, lipid is the most variable in concentration, and this variation is largely responsible for the variation in energy content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The milk lipid content rises throughout lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], varies over the course of one day, increases within feeds, and varies from mother to mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In particular, the lipid content of hindmilk (milk at end of expression) may be 1.5 to 3 times more than that of foremilk (milk at beginning of expression), contributing 55 versus 42 percent of calories, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The total lipid content of human milk is not affected by maternal diet, although it may be correlated directly with maternal body fat stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Despite the variability among women, human milk lipid content is adequate for the nutritional needs of the infant throughout lactation. </p><p>The lipid and energy contents of human milk increase during lactation, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111635 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This was illustrated in a study that compared human milk samples of mothers who had breastfed for &gt;1 year with those from mothers who had breastfed for two to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Milk from mothers who had lactated longer provided more energy content (880 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/L</span> versus 741 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/L,</span> respectively) and had more fat content estimated by creamatocrit measurement (10.7 versus 7.4 percent). (Creamatocrit is determined by centrifugation of 75 microL milk samples within glass capillary tubes. The measurement of fat is the percentage of fat to the total length of the milk.) </p><p>Human milk facilitates lipid digestion and absorption by its organization of lipid into milk fat globule triglycerides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These globules are digested by bile salt-stimulated gastric lipase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Human milk is unique in its content of very long-chain fatty acids such as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, derivatives of the essential fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acids. Arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids have been associated with improved cognition, growth, and vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Neurodevelopmental outcome'</a>.)</p><p>Fatty acids in human milk are distributed on the triglyceride molecule and consist of a high proportion of long-chain fatty acids: palmitic, oleic, and the essential fatty acids, linoleic, and linolenic. The triglyceride structure is designed for enhanced lipid absorption with esterification of palmitic acid, the major fatty acid. This permits lipase to hydrolyze palmitic acid into two monoglycerides, which are better absorbed than the free palmitic acid. In addition to enhanced lipid absorption, mineral absorption is improved since free palmitic acid is not available to bind minerals. The enhanced absorption of lipid and minerals from human milk is diminished if human milk is pasteurized, because lipase is heat labile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>To match the overall lipid absorption from human milk, formula has a greater quantity of passively absorbed medium chain-length fatty acids (MCFA) than human milk. This supplementation of MCFA decreases the overall content of long-chain fatty acids in formula compared with human milk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CARBOHYDRATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human milk carbohydrate is comprised principally of lactose, with a small proportion consisting of oligosaccharides. Studies in term infants demonstrate unabsorbed lactose in the feces of breastfed infants, which is assumed to be a normal consequence of breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. A softer stool consistency, nonpathogenic bacterial fecal flora, and improved absorption of minerals have been attributed to the lactose in human milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Oligosaccharides, found in carbohydrate polymers and glycoproteins, are important in the host defense of the infant as their structures mimic specific bacterial antigen receptors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Anti-microbial components'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MINERAL AND TRACE ELEMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concentrations of calcium and phosphorus in human milk are relatively constant through lactation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111635 \">table 2</a>), but are significantly lower than in formula. Despite lower mineral concentration and intake, bone mineral accretion and status of breastfed infants is similar to that of infants fed formula due to enhanced absorption (bioavailability) during the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. In human milk, minerals are bound to digestible proteins and are also present in complexed and ionized states, making them more readily bioavailable than in bovine milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In one study, follow-up at eight years of age showed that children who were breastfed compared with those not breastfed had significantly greater bone mass, and the effect was greater in those who had breastfed for &gt;3 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Although concentrations of iron, zinc, and copper decline during lactation, the needs for these nutrients are usually adequately met through the first six months of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62525 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>Beyond six months of age, iron and other micronutrient-containing complementary foods should be introduced to prevent deficiencies in full-term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-for-full-term-infants/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

These mothers should receive vitamin B12 supplementation or should eat foods fortified with vitamin B12. Commonly used B12-fortified foods include certain brands of nutritional yeasts, most ready-to-eat cereals, many meat analogs, and some milk alternatives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin K deficiency is common in the newborn infant. This is due to the low vitamin K content of breast milk, inadequate production of vitamin K by an immature liver, absence of the bacterial flora that produce vitamin K, and poor placental transfer of vitamin K. In breastfed infants, the plasma concentrations of all vitamin K dependent factors are about 20 percent of the adult values. Therefore, prophylactic administration of vitamin K1 oxide (phytonadione, 1 mg intramuscularly) is given to newborns shortly after birth to prevent vitamin K hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
