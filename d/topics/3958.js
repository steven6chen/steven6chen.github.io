GVHD occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non-identical donor (the graft) recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction that causes disease in the transplant recipient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>GVHD has been classically divided into acute and chronic variants based upon the time of onset using a cutoff of 100 days. However, this conventional division has been challenged by the recognition that signs of acute and chronic GVHD may occur outside of these designated periods. This observation has led to the increased use of clinical findings, rather than a set time period, to differentiate between acute and chronic GVHD. The widely accepted National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria for the diagnosis of GVHD include an overlap syndrome in which diagnostic or distinctive features of chronic GVHD and acute GVHD appear together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Clinical manifestations of chronic GVHD include skin involvement resembling lichen planus or the cutaneous manifestations of scleroderma; dry oral mucosa with ulcerations and sclerosis of the gastrointestinal tract; and a rising serum bilirubin concentration. In contrast, patients with acute GVHD commonly demonstrate a classic maculopapular rash; abdominal cramps with diarrhea; and a rising serum bilirubin concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical and histological manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of chronic GVHD.

The exact incidence of chronic GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is unknown. While chronic GVHD occurs in approximately 40 percent of allogeneic HCT recipient, reported incidence rates range from 6 to 80 percent, depending upon the presence of risk factors and the diagnostic criteria used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

Among 34 analyzed variables, high recipient age, previous acute GVHD, female donor to male recipient, and a history of chronic myeloid leukemia were identified as significant risk factors for the development of chronic GVHD.

Diagnostic features are those that establish the diagnosis of chronic GVHD without need of further investigation. In contrast, distinctive features are seen in patients with chronic GVHD and are absent in patients with acute GVHD, but require further investigation to confirm the diagnosis.

Traditionally, chronic cutaneous GVHD has been classified as lichen planus-like or sclerotic (resembling scleroderma); however, many different clinical presentations of chronic GVHD are now recognized, reflecting a spectrum of epidermal and dermal (sclerotic) changes. Details regarding the cutaneous manifestations of chronic GVHD are presented separately.

Affected patients often give a history of photoactivation. Alternating areas of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation are commonly observed. Without effective treatment, the affected skin may become progressively indurated and fixed to the underlying fascia. The epidermis becomes significantly atrophic with prominent poikiloderma, with some patients possessing localized lesions that resemble morphea. The skin may be hyperpigmented, hypopigmented, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hide-like, with the development of joint contractures similar to those observed with scleroderma.</p><p>The following cutaneous findings can establish the presence of chronic GVHD without the need for further testing or evidence of other organ involvement (ie, diagnostic features) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Poikiloderma</strong> &ndash; A combination of atrophy, hypopigmentation, and hyperpigmentation in the skin usually appearing as patches with mottled pigmentation and telangiectasias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F66942\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66942 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lichen planus-like features</strong> &ndash; Erythematous to violaceous papules or plaques with a predilection for the dorsal hands and feet, forearms, and trunk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55336\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55336 \">picture 2</a>).

There is typically a temporal evolution of skin findings. Initially, there may be marked, nonpitting edema of the extremities. With progression of the disease, the swelling resolves and is replaced by symmetrical induration with puckering that gives the skin the texture of orange peel (peau d&rsquo;orange). Contractures and joint stiffness are also observed resulting in limited range of joint motion, most commonly involving the wrists or fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76298\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76298 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows high intensity in muscle in fat suppressed T2 weighted images. Biopsy is often deferred due to concerns regarding the risk of impaired wound healing. When a biopsy is performed, histology demonstrates lymphocytic infiltration, edema, and fibrosis in the fascia and subcutaneous septa. The infiltration is diffuse and it often extends into the subcutaneous fat and pericapillary space, but usually spares the muscle itself.

The muscle weakness is described as moderate to severe symmetrical weakness of the proximal muscles, the neck flexors, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limb girdle. Involvement of the muscles of the upper esophagus, pharynx, respiratory system, and heart are rare. Serum creatine kinase is usually 5 to 50 times the upper limit of normal, but may be within normal limits early in the disease process. Elevations in other enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, and aminotransferases are also common. Autoantibodies directed against the nucleus, smooth muscle cells, or mitochondria may be present. Electromyography (EMG) is usually abnormal and demonstrates findings consistent with an inflammatory myopathy (eg, fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, short-duration and small amplitude motor unit action potentials, and full interference patterns in weak muscles). Biopsy is necessary to confirm involvement. Histopathology demonstrates the degeneration, necrosis and regeneration of muscle fibers and infiltrates of inflammatory cells of donor origin.
