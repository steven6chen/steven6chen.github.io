It can occur in conjunction with aortic dissection or in isolation. The focus of this review is spontaneous, isolated dissection of the mesenteric arteries, particularly of the superior mesenteric artery but also of the celiac axis; isolated inferior mesenteric artery dissection is rarely reported. </p><p>Acute aortic dissection is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636997030\"><span class=\"h1\">MESENTERIC VASCULAR ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous mesenteric dissection has a predilection for the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and also occurs in the celiac artery, though rarely in the inferior mesenteric artery. Combined SMA and celiac artery dissection can also occur. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1866410743\"><span class=\"h2\">Celiac axis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The celiac axis originates from the abdominal aorta at the level of the 12<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebrae and provides blood flow to the structures arising from the primitive foregut (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110821\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110821 \">figure 1</a>). The 10<sup>th</sup> primitive ventral segmental artery gives rise to the celiac axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The celiac axis is short, with its takeoff perpendicular to the aorta and perhaps slightly caudal. Most commonly, after a short course, the celiac axis branches to provide left gastric, hepatic, and splenic arteries; however, the pattern of branching can be highly variable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2760158135\"><span class=\"h2\">Superior mesenteric artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) originates from the abdominal aorta and provides arterial inflow to the structures of the midgut (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89910 \">figure 2</a>). The SMA typically develops out of the 13<sup>th</sup> primitive ventral segmental artery; however, many aberrations can occur during development, resulting in a range of anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The origin of the SMA is located just below the origin of the celiac axis at the level of the first lumbar vertebrae. From its origin, the SMA courses anteriorly with varying degrees of angulation from the aorta for a distance of approximately 2 cm, after which it turns inferiorly, coursing along a similar axis to the aorta. Within this portion, the SMA has an outer wall and an inner wall, which has a bearing on the pathophysiology of SMA dissection. (See <a href=\"#H1645696742\" class=\"local\">'Etiologic factors'</a> below.) </p><p>The SMA continues inferiorly, passing behind the splenic vein and pancreas but anterior to the duodenum. It is normally positioned anterior to the left renal vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60042\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60042 \">figure 3</a>). The first branch arising from the SMA is typically the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756 \">figure 4</a>). The next branch is typically the middle colic artery. Thereafter, the SMA gives rise to multiple jejunal branches and then to right colic and ileocolic branches, which provide terminal branches that supply the intestines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H838893456\"><span class=\"h2\">Collateral circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SMA has collateral connections to the celiac axis and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89911\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89911 \">figure 5</a>). The celiac axis pathway to the SMA is via the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery and, in some individuals, via a persistent embryonic connection known as the arc of B&uuml;hler. The middle colic branch of the SMA connects to the IMA via the marginal artery of Drummond and via the meandering mesenteric artery, which is also known as the arc of Riolan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1511342219\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arterial wall is composed of three layers. From lumen to exterior, these are the intima, media, and adventitia; the media is the thickest layer with the most number of and frequently separated layers. Vascular dissection refers to the phenomenon that occurs when a focal tear in the intima exposes the deeper layers of the artery and forcibly separates these layers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Separation occurs longitudinally and circumferentially and is variable in extent, ranging from a short, focal intimal flap to a lengthy lesion that creates a true lumen and a false lumen. By definition, the true lumen of the artery is surrounded by all three vessel layers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The dissection can remain focal or can progress to obliterate the true lumen or weaken the arterial wall, leading to arterial rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The extent of the dissection (circumferential, longitudinal) and severity of lumen compromise determine the nature of the clinical manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H463704895\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>Manifestations of mesenteric artery dissection are most commonly related to lumen reduction with varying degrees of intestinal ischemia. Lumen reduction is caused by pressurization of the false lumen leading to compression of the true lumen. If flow is occurring through the false lumen, then flow in the true lumen is proportionately reduced with increasing impingement. However, multiple communications can occur between the true and false lumens, thereby allowing flow through the false lumen to contribute to distal perfusion. As the dissection propagates distally, branch vessels can also become compressed, leading to local ischemia and infarction despite minimal compromise of the main vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1645696742\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiologic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure, along with other factors (eg, flow vectors, mural defects) within the artery, contribute to the initiation and propagation of mesenteric artery dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid pressure &ndash; The occurrence of the intimal tear and progression of the dissection are mediated by the presence of forces that overwhelm the tensile and adhesive strength of the arterial wall. With spontaneous mesenteric artery dissection, this force is produced in part by intra-arterial blood pressure. However, it should be noted that only a minority of patients with mesenteric artery dissection are hypertensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow vectors &ndash; Dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) has been observed to begin on its anterior surface along the convex outer curvature just beyond its takeoff as it turns inferiorly. With the assistance of computer models, increased hemodynamic forces are consistently shown within this segment of the SMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Similar conditions are present within the descending thoracic aorta occurring along the greater curvature of the aortic arch just distal to the takeoff of the subclavian artery, which may contribute to thoracic aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, with SMA dissection, hypertension and histologic abnormalities are less frequently encountered, and thus this hemodynamic condition is regarded by some as the primary etiologic component. On the other hand, similar descriptions have not been offered for occurrence of dissection occurring in the celiac axis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wall strength &ndash; Limited histologic evaluation is available for specimens of SMA dissection. Unlike aortic dissection, where wall abnormalities related to atherosclerosis, cystic medial necrosis, or connective tissue disorders have been associated with aortic dissection, no such abnormalities are commonly identified with mesenteric artery dissection. Myxoid degeneration of the dissected arterial has been reported in cases of SMA dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1160120764\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of mesenteric artery dissection is unknown. One review identified 143 reports, mostly from small case series, reporting on superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection, making it a relatively rare abdominal pathology. With the increasing use of cross-sectional abdominal imaging, the incidence is likely to increase. </p><p>Patients tend to be in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Males are much more commonly affected than females. The majority (70 percent) of reported cases of SMA dissection come from Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p>Typical risk factors for atherosclerosis (eg, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia) are usually absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Smoking and hypertension appear to have some correlation, though these are absent in the majority of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463704895\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4094720467\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some cases may come to clinical attention due to an incidental finding of mesenteric dissection on computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen performed for reasons not related to the dissection, although this is thought to occur in a minority of patients. Asymptomatic patients represent a small group of patients with superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection, but the numbers may be increasing as axial imaging is increasingly being used to evaluate patients with suspected abdominal pathology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2337342100\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms and signs are directly related to the effects of the dissection (ie, pain from tissue separation, local hematoma, inflammation) or are from malperfusion leading to intestinal ischemia. Patients typically present with their first episode and will not report having similar episodes in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Nearly all patients with symptomatic SMA dissection will present with abdominal pain. Associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also be present but are often absent. Patients with celiac artery dissection present similarly, and differentiating between these is not possible without imaging. (See <a href=\"#H1037702603\" class=\"local\">'Vascular imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>The pain is typically sudden in onset, severe in intensity, and located in the epigastric or periumbilical regions. It is not alleviated or aggravated by eating. Pain can be attributed to dissection alone without the occurrence of ischemia. However, pain that is characterized as out of proportion to the physical exam is suggestive of intestinal ischemia. The degree of pain has been correlated to both the extent of the dissection as well as the resulting ischemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609631291\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While performing the survey, the clinician should note the patient's comfort level. Patients with mesenteric artery dissection are uncomfortable appearing and cannot remain still for very long. Findings on physical examination are minimal, at least initially. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion#H420418691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mesenteric arterial occlusion&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4222138820\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory studies are typically obtained for patients presenting with abdominal pain, including complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests, amylase tests, lipase tests, lactate tests, and urinary analysis. However, these are nonspecific. Much of the laboratory examination will be completely normal in patients with mesenteric dissection, particularly early on, but laboratories are useful for ruling out other potential etiologies for abdominal pain, and certain abnormalities (eg, elevated lactate, elevated white blood count, elevated liver function tests) may suggest the occurrence of complications, such as intestinal ischemia or perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain#H552587793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;, section on 'Initial workup'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190364758\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4096185857\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A specific diagnosis of mesenteric arterial dissection is often not initially suspected based on the clinical presentation, given the rarity of the condition. In less severe pain presentations, the diagnosis can be elusive, often resulting in a diagnostic delay, which increases the potential for the development of complications and medical deterioration of the patient. For patients suspected of having a vascular cause for abdominal pain, determining the specific etiology relies on advanced vascular imaging. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037702603\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have undergone cross-sectional abdominal imaging (with or without intravenous contrast), the dissected portion of the vessel may be apparent depending upon the resolution of the scan. If another etiology for abdominal pain is not identified, we suggest high-resolution multislice computed tomographic (CT) angiography. In most centers, CT angiography is readily available and can be performed in most patients with minimal risk. However, in a subset of patients with allergy or renal dysfunction, the intravenous contrast load may be less desirable. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is an alternative. </p><p>CT angiography is highly sensitive for identifying intimal flaps of clinical significance and differentiating arterial dissection from atherosclerotic thrombotic occlusion or embolic occlusion. The anatomic findings for various vascular lesions have characteristic anatomic locations (first branch of the superior mesenteric artery [SMA] for embolism, atherosclerotic lesions at the origin of the SMA for thrombotic occlusion). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion#H420418691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mesenteric arterial occlusion&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The extent and severity of SMA or celiac artery dissection range from a small intimal flap to lengthy artery occlusion. CT angiography also shows the collateral flow around the dissected vessel, which can be important for anticipating the severity of clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Catheter-based arteriography can also establish a diagnosis of SMA or celiac artery dissection and has the added advantage of providing hemodynamic information and potentially providing treatment. However, it is invasive and generally does not provide much information regarding nonvascular etiologies contained within the differential diagnosis. Thus, arteriography is generally reserved for patients shown to have mesenteric artery dissection and who have concerning radiographic features (eg, large intimal flap, lumen compromise, risk for rupture) that require additional diagnostic information or that may be considered for endovascular treatment. It may also be indicated in those who fail to improve in response to medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1804966919\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Duplex ultrasonography can also be used to evaluate the mesenteric arteries but is highly operator dependent and often requires a confirmatory exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, at institutions that perform mesenteric ultrasonography routinely and well, the examination can be incorporated into the diagnostic algorithm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962379695\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A classification scheme has been proposed based upon the angiographic appearance and correlates with the clinical course (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109983\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109983 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I lesions do not result in compromised distal flow. They represent lesions in which an intimal tear has occurred but the resulting dissection merely forms a septum that separates flow in the true lumen from flow in the false lumen, both of which contribute to uncompromised distal flow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II lesions result in compromised flow. These lesions occur when flow beyond the proximal tear between the true and false lumens is separated by the septum and there are no communications distally. Flow can persist into a false lumen but will continue to compromise flow in the true lumen, leading to decreased distal flow and ischemia. In addition, branch vessels in the region of dissection are at risk for compromise leading to local ischemia in the distribution of the affected branch. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III lesions result in complete occlusion and cessation of flow through the dissected segment of artery. The distal flow depends completely on collateral pathways that reconstitute beyond the occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H838893456\" class=\"local\">'Collateral circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2057119669\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of mesenteric artery dissection as a cause of abdominal pain includes nonvascular and vascular etiologies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain#H552587793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;, section on 'Initial workup'</a>.)</p><p>The suddenness and severity of the abdominal pain combined with minimal initial physical findings provide a clue that suggests a vascular rather than another more typical etiology for abdominal pain, although this alone is not helpful in distinguishing mesenteric artery dissection from other vascular etiologies of intestinal ischemia. However, such a presentation in a younger patient without risk factors for embolism, nonocclusive ischemia, or thrombotic mesenteric occlusion may point toward mesenteric dissection, particularly in those of Asian descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Like patients with other etiologies of acute abdominal vascular syndromes, vascular imaging will demonstrate the anatomic problem. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190365308\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"#H1037702603\" class=\"local\">'Vascular imaging'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1804966919\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H733744337\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal exploration is indicated for patients who present initially with severe bowel ischemia (eg, peritonitis, free air) and for those patients who fail to improve or develop signs of worsening intestinal ischemia with initial medical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2426606075\" class=\"local\">'Initial medical therapy and monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Laparotomy, rather than laparoscopy, may be safer and more expedient for evaluating the viscera in the face of grossly dilated bowel. The extent and severity of intestinal ischemia, including the appearance of the abdominal contents (color, distention), peristalsis, arterial pulsations in the mesenteric arcades, and bleeding from cut surfaces, should be assessed. Areas of the intestine that are clearly nonviable (ie, full-thickness ischemia with dilated, dark, paralyzed bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110502\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110502 \">picture 1</a>)) and areas of impending or gross perforation should be quickly resected using a stapler to contain or prevent gross spillage. </p><p>Whether to restore distal perfusion depends on the perfusion of the remaining bowel at the time of exploration. Bowel of questionable viability that peristalses even a little should be left intact until after perfusion is restored, after which bowel viability should be reassessed. Instillation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> may aid with determining the level of bowel perfusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110506 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2426606075\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial medical therapy and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For symptomatic patients not requiring immediate abdominal exploration, medical therapy should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or celiac artery dissection is confirmed to prevent vessel thrombosis and to reduce the likelihood of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Asymptomatic patients should also be treated. Treatment includes antithrombotic therapy, controlling blood pressure, and treatment of pain. (See <a href=\"#H1779521344\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3632031937\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure lowering'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2541461573\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to specific treatment for mesenteric artery dissection, management includes bowel rest, fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and possibly broad-spectrum antibiotics. Supplemental parenteral nutrition may be needed if the period of bowel rest required becomes prolonged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1822158737\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should undergo serial examination and follow-up imaging typically after 48 hours but prior to discharge. The majority of patients with symptomatic mesenteric artery dissection will be successfully managed with medical therapy. Failure of medical management occurs in 10 to 45 percent, with higher rates correlating with more severe or complex dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109983\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109983 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (see <a href=\"#H962379695\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above). Combined celiac axis and SMA involvement has a higher failure rate, presumed to be due to compromised collateral flow between the two vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients who fail to improve clinically or who worsen either clinically or radiographically should be considered for intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

We place patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and heparin initially. Once pain has resolved, we repeat imaging and, if there is any residual abnormality, the patient is transitioned to oral Vitamin K antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>). If the artery shows interval remodeling, we maintain the patient on antiplatelet therapy alone with aspirin. However, others have suggested anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists for one year as a standard regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3632031937\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood pressure lowering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications to lower blood pressure and control heart rate are prescribed in a manner similar to the treatment of aortic dissection. Although hypertension is not commonly present in patients with mesenteric artery dissection, it is thought that local increased hemodynamic forces at least contribute to the pathophysiology. (See <a href=\"#H1511342219\" class=\"local\">'Definition and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Beta blockade followed by alpha blockade, if needed, appears to be the best strategy. Beta blockade is initiated to achieve the lowest allowable heart rate while avoiding symptomatic bradycardia. If pain and hypertension persist, an alpha blocker can be added to the regimen to achieve normotensive target. Our target blood pressure is 100 to 120 mmHg. Caution should be taken not to lower blood pressure to a point where intestinal perfusion becomes compromised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes#H1628662340\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Acute medical management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2541461573\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to adequately control pain as this can contribute to hypertension, which in turn worsens pain in a positive feedback loop.

For patients with compromised distal perfusion and those with refractory pain but without signs of severe intestinal ischemia, the goal of intervention is to correct the arterial abnormality and restore distal perfusion prior to loss of bowel viability. This can be accomplished using an open surgical or endovascular approach or a combination of both. The approach depends upon the extent and location of the dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Vascular intervention will also be required for patients who develop mesenteric artery aneurysm (typically late aneurysm formation; diameter &ge;2 cm) to prevent future rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2188170001\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysm formation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of visceral artery aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Certainly, patients with potential loss of bowel viability should be considered for an open surgical approach. An open surgical approach allows complete assessment of the bowel, which is not possible with an endovascular approach alone; however, when an open approach is deemed necessary, endovascular revascularization may still be possible using open, retrograde vascular access. Alternatively, laparoscopy can be used to inspect the bowel, and, if no issues are identified, an endovascular approach may be used. </p><p>Although more invasive, early success rates for open surgical revascularization are similar to those of endovascular therapy, with both approaches having increased mortality for patients with symptomatic SMA dissection who fail medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/12,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22</a>]. However, the long-term patency for surgical revascularization appears superior. Therefore, each patient should be assessed individually on the basis of patient risk, anatomy, and status of disease to select the most appropriate form of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2913806428\"><span class=\"h3\">Open approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open surgical reconstruction is the best option for managing long SMA lesions and possibly occlusions that involve multiple branch vessels. One option is excision of the intimal flap with patch angioplasty. It is important to resect all of the septum proximally and achieve a satisfactory distal endpoint. Inability to address all of the proximal pathology will mandate surgical bypass. Vein conduit is preferred in most circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>].</p><p>Surgical exposure depends on the vessel affected and extent of the arterial dissection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The celiac axis can be approached though an upper midline laparotomy. The left lobe of the liver is mobilized and retracted to the right. The lesser omentum is divided, allowing for retraction of the esophagus and stomach to the left. The aorta is palpated, and the overlying crural fibers are divided until the aorta is exposed. Dissection along the aorta inferiorly will intersect the takeoff of the celiac axis. Further dissection along the celiac axis itself will lead to the branch vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first few centimeters of the SMA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110493\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110493 \">picture 3</a>) are best exposed via a medial visceral rotation either through a transabdominal or retroperitoneal approach. More distal exposure is limited by the pancreas and duodenum through this approach. Exposure of the SMA beyond the pancreas is best performed using an anterior approach. The omentum and transverse colon are retracted cephalad while the small bowel is moved to the right of the abdomen. The SMA is located at the base of the small bowel mesentery as it crosses the duodenum. Taking down the ligament of Treitz further facilitates exposure. The artery is positioned to the left and posterior in relation to the superior mesenteric vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H812843498\"><span class=\"h3\">Endovascular approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular treatment is generally used for focal, proximal lesions without significant branch involvement, but it can be used for more extensive lesions in patients who are not felt to be good operative candidates. Endovascular stent placement is the most commonly used technique to reestablish lumen patency. Treatment may also be needed to address arterial vasospasm or thrombus. Direct infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papaverine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">papaverine</a> has been reported with favorable results as an adjunct; however, experience with thrombolysis has produced marginal results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-mesenteric-arterial-dissection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>It is unclear whether bare metal or covered stents should be used for the initial dissection, but, in the presence of mesenteric aneurysm, covered stent placement is required.

Spontaneous mesenteric dissection has a predilection for the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and also occurs in the celiac artery, but rarely in the inferior mesenteric artery. Combined SMA and celiac artery dissection can also occur. (See <a href=\"#H1511342219\" class=\"local\">'Definition and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesenteric artery dissection is rare. Risk factors include male sex, older age, and Asian ethnicity. Risk factors for atherosclerosis are usually absent. Although blood pressure likely plays a role in the pathogenesis, only a minority of patients with mesenteric artery dissection are hypertensive. (See <a href=\"#H1160120764\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly all patients with SMA or celiac artery dissection will present with abdominal pain; asymptomatic presentations are rare. The severity and suddenness of abdominal pain in the face of minimal abdominal findings suggests a vascular rather than another etiology for abdominal pain. Such a presentation in a younger patient without risk factors for other vascular etiologies of intestinal ischemia (eg, embolism, nonocclusive ischemia, thrombotic mesenteric occlusion) may point to mesenteric dissection, particularly among Asian patients. (See <a href=\"#H463704895\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4096185857\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2057119669\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomographic (CT) angiography is highly sensitive for identifying intimal flaps of clinical significance and for differentiating arterial dissection from embolic or atherosclerosis-related thrombotic occlusion. CT angiography also shows the collateral flow around the dissected vessel, which can be important for anticipating the clinical course. A classification scheme of the extent of SMA dissection based upon the angiographic appearance also correlates with the clinical course. (See <a href=\"#H4096185857\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H962379695\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with confirmed spontaneous mesenteric or celiac artery dissection without severe intestinal ischemia necessitating abdominal exploration, we suggest initial medical therapy, rather than any form of vascular intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The aim of medical therapy is to prevent vessel thrombosis and to reduce the likelihood of progression. The majority of patients with mesenteric artery dissection can be successfully managed medically, which includes antithrombotic therapy, blood pressure lowering, and treatment of pain. Patients should undergo serial examination, with follow-up imaging typically after 48 hours but prior to discharge. (See <a href=\"#H733744337\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal exploration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2426606075\" class=\"local\">'Initial medical therapy and monitoring'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of medical management occurs in 10 to 45 percent of patients. Higher failure rates are seen with combined celiac and SMA involvement, presumably because of a loss of collateral flow between the two vessels. Patients who develop signs of worsening intestinal ischemia with initial medical management also require abdominal exploration to evaluate the bowel and resect nonviable segments. Whether to restore distal perfusion depends on the perfusion of the remaining bowel at the time of exploration.
