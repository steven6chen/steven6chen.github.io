The incidence of gastroschisis is similar in male and female fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>], higher in singleton pregnancies than in twin pregnancies, and higher in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white mothers than non-Hispanic black mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Studies worldwide have consistently reported that young women (ie, under 20 years of age) have a severalfold higher rate of offspring with gastroschisis than the general obstetrical population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/19,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24-26</a>]. This is likely related to lifestyle factors that characterize this population (cigarette smoking, use of recreational drugs, alcohol consumption, low body mass index, increased frequency of genitourinary infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/5,24,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24,27-32</a>].</p><p>Developed and developing countries worldwide have reported an increasing incidence of gastroschisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/23,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33,34</a>]. In a study of data from 25 population-based registries in 15 European countries, maternal age-standardized incidence of gastroschisis increased almost fourfold, from 0.54 per 10,000 births between 1980 and 1984 to 2.12 per 10,000 births between 2000 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Similarly, data from 14 US states showed a 30 percent increase in incidence from 1995-2005 to 2006-2012 (from 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/10,000</span> to 4.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/10,000);</span> the increase varied but was significant across all categories of maternal age and <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The postnatal diagnosis of gastroschisis is based on physical examination showing the characteristic clinical finding of a full-thickness paraumbilical abdominal wall defect, often associated with evisceration of bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61463 \">picture 1</a>). It is usually located to the right of the umbilical cord insertion site and tends to be &lt;4 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. There is no covering membrane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On ultrasound examination, gastroschisis consists of a relatively small (&lt;4 cm) paraumbilical abdominal wall defect, usually to the right of the midline, with visceral herniation. The umbilical cord insertion site is adjacent to and separate from the defect and should be normal. The intestine usually is the only herniated organ; other intra-abdominal organs rarely pass through the defect, but the liver and stomach may also herniate. The stomach is usually malpositioned, even when intra-abdominal. The intestinal mass lacks a covering membrane and floats freely in the amniotic fluid.</p><p>The exteriorized bowel appears cauliflower-like because fluid between adjacent bowel loops results in acoustic interfaces at both near and far bowel walls. Visualization of the bowel is enhanced by the highly echogenic bowel wall edema and inflammation that may occur in addition to the dilated lumen created by multiple volvuli in the free floating loops. Late in pregnancy, the eviscerated bowel often appears thickened, matted, and mildly dilated due to chronic exposure to amniotic fluid. The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of bowel also may become dilated due to obstruction. In a study that used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the morphology of gastroschisis in 24 fetuses over the course of pregnancy, three fetuses imaged in both the second and third trimester showed increased extracorporeal displacement of bowel in the third trimester, and three fetuses with bowel dilatation suggestive of obstruction all had small bowel stenosis at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The stomach, duodenum, liver, spleen, and bladder were intra-abdominal in all 24 fetuses, and the fetal stomach was in contact with the fetal bladder, except when bowel dilation prevented this from occurring.</p><p>Almost all cases of gastroschisis are associated with an elevated maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) level; thus, the possibility of gastroschisis, as well as other fetal anomalies, should be considered in pregnancies with elevated second trimester MSAFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. In one series of 23 cases, the MSAFP level was elevated in every case, with a median value of 9.42 MoMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In another series of 20 cases of gastroschisis, the median MSAFP was 7.0 MoMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. By comparison, the MSAFP in pregnancies with open spina bifida are, on average, 4 MoMs and anencephaly 8 MoMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. An elevated MSAFP is an indication for thorough ultrasonographic examination of the fetus for anatomic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Alpha-fetoprotein'</a>.)</p><p>The combination of ultrasound examination and MSAFP screening detects at least 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121861309\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated anomalies and findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastroschisis is termed &quot;simple&quot; when isolated and &quot;complex&quot; when associated with coexisting intestinal abnormalities, but this distinction is often not possible to discern prenatally. Associated gastrointestinal anomalies and problems (eg, malrotation, atresia, stenosis, perforation, necrosis, volvulus) occur in up to 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>] and may be related to vascular disruption caused by herniated bowel. Disruption of the superior mesenteric artery, for example, may lead to volvulus or to &quot;apple peel&quot; jejunal-ileal lesions. Meckel's diverticulum and gallbladder atresia also occur, but are less common. Bladder herniation has been reported in 6 percent of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97276\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97276 \">image 1</a>), with bowel or urinary tract dilation. A rare type of complex gastroschisis has been termed &quot;closed,&quot; &quot;closing,&quot; or &quot;vanishing&quot; gastroschisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-50</a>]. In these cases, the defect closes around the viscera, which can cause intestinal atresia and ischemia or midgut infarction resulting in short bowel syndrome. </p><p>Most cases have no extraintestinal abnormalities. In a study of pooled data from 24 international birth defects registries including over 3300 cases of gastroschisis, only approximately 10 percent of gastroschisis cases were associated with major unrelated defects, approximately 2 percent of cases were part of a recognized syndrome, and cardiac anomalies were detected in 2 to 3 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, this may be due to ascertainment bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/34,43,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,43,51-53</a>]. A study using a prospectively collected database including almost 4700 infants with gastroschisis discharged from 348 neonatal intensive care units in North America reported associated anomalies in 8 percent and cardiac anomalies in 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], but others have reported associated anomalies in as many as one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Oligohydramnios is the most common amniotic fluid abnormality, but polyhydramnios may occur, particularly in fetuses with reduced bowel motility or obstruction.</p><p>There is no increase in incidence of aneuploidy when gastroschisis is isolated or simple.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121860697\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic images</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroschisis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76768%7EOBGYN%2F97277%7EOBGYN%2F63613\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76768 graphicRef97277 graphicRef63613 \">image 2A-C</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color Doppler image of umbilical cord and gastroschisis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61153\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61153 \">image 3</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three-dimensional ultrasound of gastroschisis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69631\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69631 \">image 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121861625\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Omphalocele is the major disorder to consider in differential diagnosis. The membranous sac helps to distinguish omphalocele from gastroschisis; however, membranes occasionally rupture in utero. If the membrane ruptures, the locations of the liver and cord insertion site can help to differentiate an omphalocele from gastroschisis. Omphalocele is often associated with an extracorporeal liver, while the liver is typically intracorporeal in gastroschisis. The cord insertion site is into an umbilical sac in omphalocele and paraumbilical onto otherwise intact abdominal wall in gastroschisis. Gastroschisis is associated with a lower rate of associated defects than omphalocele (32 versus 80 percent in one large study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] and 8 versus 35 percent in another large study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p>Other major abdominal wall defects in differential diagnosis, ectopia cordis, limb-body wall complex, cloacal exstrophy, and urachal cyst, are rare (prevalence of each less than 1 in 100,000 births). Omphalocele and body-stalk defects are connected to the cord, ectopia cordis develops above and bladder exstrophy below the cord insertion, and gastroschisis is paraumbilical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96558\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96558 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTETRICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is wide variability in the antenatal management of gastroschisis due to a lack of high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses with isolated gastroschisis is not increased above the baseline population risk, so invasive fetal genetic testing is not routinely offered. We suggest fetal genetic evaluation if nongastrointestinal structural abnormalities are identified on ultrasound examination. Microarray molecular testing rather than G-banding has been recommended whenever fetal structural anomalies are detected on prenatal ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], but the additional value in cases of gastroschisis has not been studied extensively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>In the study of pooled data from 24 international birth defects registries described above, there were 41 syndromes related to aneuploidy among the 3322 cases of gastroschisis (1.2 percent of the total cases, which included isolated and nonisolated); the most frequent abnormalities were trisomy 18 (15 cases), trisomy 13 (14 cases), sex chromosomes anomalies (4 cases), and trisomy 21 (2 cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common pregnancy complications associated with gastroschisis include development of growth restriction (30 to 60 percent of cases), intrauterine fetal demise (3 to 6 percent), spontaneous preterm birth (30 percent), and bowel dilation and wall thickening (common, frequency depends on diagnostic criteria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/51,59-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,59-63</a>]. The mechanisms causing these adverse outcomes in gastroschisis are unclear. Therefore, pregnancy monitoring is empiric and typically includes serial ultrasound examinations for assessment of fetal growth and fetal bowel abnormality and standard tests for antepartum fetal surveillance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121862674\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform serial ultrasound examinations every three weeks for assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume (AFV). If growth arrest or oligohydramnios is diagnosed, umbilical artery Doppler flow is evaluated. &#160;</p><p>Growth impairment is common in gastroschisis, occurring in one- to two-thirds of fetuses, depending upon the criteria used (birth weight for gestational age below the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile versus below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Deficiency in growth may be due to loss of protein and fluid across the exposed bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. We use a standard formula for estimating fetal weight, which was validated in one large study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Because the most commonly used formulas for estimating fetal weight, such as Hadlock, rely heavily on the measurement of abdominal circumference, others have reported that these formulas tend to underestimate the weight of these fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Siemer and colleagues developed a specific formula for estimating fetal weight in fetuses with abdominal wall defects using the biparietal diameter, occipitofrontal diameter, and femur length measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. This formula appears to estimate fetal weight in these fetuses more accurately than formulas using abdominal circumference, and is used by some clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. </p><p>Growth restriction in fetuses with abdominal wall defects is predictive of an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Given the known perinatal risks associated with fetal growth restriction, we believe antepartum fetal surveillance is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H83783110\" class=\"local\">'Antepartum fetal surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p>AFV abnormalities frequently occur. Oligohydramnios may be related to fetal growth restriction and is a risk factor for cord compression and its sequelae. Polyhydramnios is less common, but an important finding because it is often caused by dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract due to bowel atresia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121862729\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of fetal bowel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform serial targeted sonographic evaluation of the stomach and bowel (both intra- and extra-abdominal) to look for significant dilatation or acute changes (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">thickening/edema)</span>. If such changes are observed prior to 34 weeks, we administer a course of glucocorticoids to enhance fetal maturation in the event that preterm delivery becomes indicated, but we do not intervene solely on the basis of bowel wall thickening or dilatation.</p><p>Prolonged exposure to the toxic environment of the amniotic fluid may damage the intestines, although a mechanism has not been proven. Gastric dilatation, bowel dilatation, and bowel wall thickening have been considered poor prognostic signs by several investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/71-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-76</a>], but others have not found the presence of these abnormalities sufficiently predictive to influence clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/59,77-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,77-85</a>]. A 2009 systematic review including data from 10 observational studies (n = 273 patients) concluded that there was no strong evidence that fetuses with isolated gastroschisis and antenatal bowel dilation greater than 10 mm or greater than 18 mm were at increased risk of intrauterine death, postnatal bowel resection, length of time to oral feeds, or length of time hospitalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. However, the small number of adverse events in these studies precluded making a definite conclusion about the significance of prenatal bowel dilation in fetuses with gastroschisis. Subsequently, one group observed that third trimester intra-abdominal bowel dilatation appeared to be modestly predictive of adverse outcome in complex gastroschisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence that extra-abdominal small bowel dilation &gt;25 mm is associated with short-term prenatal complications, including nonreassuring fetal testing and intrauterine fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In one small series, the three fetuses with external bowel diameters of 27 to 28 mm had these adverse outcomes, while 11 fetuses with diameters of 5 to 24.5 mm did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Adverse prenatal sequelae may be related to umbilical cord compression by the dilated bowel or severe uteroplacental insufficiency. Other series have observed that intra-abdominal dilatation was predictive of bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>] and associated with increased neonatal morbidity when multiple, but not single, loops of bowel were dilated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. But data are far from definitive: the threshold for dilation predictive of adverse outcome varies among studies, and some studies have not observed adverse effects from either intra-abdominal or extra-abdominal bowel dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83783110\"><span class=\"h3\">Antepartum fetal surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal growth restriction and amniotic fluid abnormalities are commonly accepted indications for increased antepartum fetal surveillance (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antepartum fetal surveillance&quot;</a>). In our practice, we order nonstress testing (NST) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a biophysical profile score (BPP) for all fetuses with gastroschisis, upon diagnosis of growth restriction or oligohydramnios, or at 32 weeks in the absence of such a diagnosis, because these pregnancies may be associated with an increased rate of fetal demise late in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/61,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,92</a>].

The decision on timing of delivery is based on a combination of factors, including gestational age (probability of fetal lung maturity), ultrasound findings (fetal growth profile, AFV, appearance of fetal bowel), and fetal testing results (NST, BPP, umbilical cord Doppler if fetal growth restriction is present).</p><p>We suggest consultation with a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist, neonatologist, and pediatric surgeon before delivery to discuss patient-specific factors in the timing of delivery. We do not consider bowel dilatation alone an indication for preterm delivery if fetal growth, AFV, and fetal testing (BPP, NST) remain reassuring (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above). In the authors&rsquo; practices, fetuses with gastroschisis, normal growth, and reassuring fetal testing are delivered in the early term period (37 weeks, if pulmonary maturity is suggested by amniocentesis, or at 38 weeks without amniocentesis). We believe available data support this approach over expectant management for minimizing neonatal morbidity (eg, sepsis, bowel damage [necrosis, atresia, perforation, adhesion]) and neonatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>], and this approach eliminates any possibility of stillbirth at term (39 to 40 weeks). Preterm delivery is performed for standard obstetrical indications (eg, nonreassuring fetal testing, lack of interval growth). However, one contributor to this topic (LWH) does not intervene until the 39<sup>th</sup> week of gestation if twice weekly fetal surveillance (BPP, NST) is reassuring and the bowel is not significantly dilated, but delivers earlier if bowel dilation &gt;25 mm develops after 37 weeks of gestation. Even when expectant management is attempted, the average gestational age at delivery is approximately 37 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>No high-quality evidence is available on which to base a recommendation for optimum timing of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Delivery as early as 33 weeks of gestation has been suggested based on reports of an increased risk of fetal demise in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/59,92,102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,92,102,103</a>] and a possible increase in risk of inflammatory bowel changes from ongoing exposure to amniotic fluid.

Thus, if fetal growth, AFV, and fetal testing (BPP, NST) are normal, the risk of intrauterine fetal demise prior to term appears to be minimal, and delivery at less than 37 weeks to reduce the risk of fetal demise is unwarranted. In a series of 261 pregnancies with gastroschisis followed with BPPs and NSTs, no stillbirths occurred, and 153 pregnancies achieved a gestational age &ge;37 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. </p><p>There is also no convincing evidence that preterm elective delivery decreases the need for silo closure, the time until enteral feeding can begin, or other gastrointestinal problems; available data are conflicting and generally of low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/99,106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,106,107</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83783631\"><span class=\"h3\">Route</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no evidence that cesarean delivery improves outcome in uncomplicated gastroschisis; surgical delivery should be reserved for usual obstetric indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/63,108-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,108-110</a>]. In a meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating the effect of mode of delivery in fetuses with abdominal wall defects (gastroschisis, omphalocele), there was no significant relationship between cesarean delivery and rate of primary fascial repair, neonatal sepsis, pediatric mortality, time until enteral feeding, or length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].</p><p>A population-based study in the United States reported 69 percent of pregnancies with gastroschisis attempted vaginal delivery in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Labor and rupture of membranes have not been proven to adversely affect outcome, although too few patients have been studied to allow a definite conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. </p><p>Some pediatric surgeons recommend cesarean delivery for gastroschisis with liver involvement, especially when there is marked liver herniation, because of the theoretic risk of dystocia and trauma.

In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared the outcome of complex versus simple gastroschisis, complex gastroschisis was associated with higher risks of in-hospital mortality (risk ratio [RR] 5.4, 95% CI 2.4-12.0), short bowel syndrome (RR 12.0, 95% CI 6.3-22.8), bowel obstruction (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.6), necrotizing enterocolitis (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.1-3.7), and parenteral nutrition and tube feedings on discharge (RR 11.2 [95% CI 3.8-33.2] and 2.8 [95% CI 1.5-5.5], respectively), but the rates of primary abdominal closure and silo bag placement were similar for both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroschisis/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].

There is no covering membrane. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of gastroschisis is unknown. All theories involve defective formation or disruption of the body wall in the embryonic period, with subsequent herniation of bowel. &#160; (See <a href=\"#H121860190\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an inverse association between maternal age and incidence of fetal gastroschisis, with the highest prevalence in whites and births to women under age 20 years.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal diagnosis is based on sonographic visualization of a paraumbilical abdominal wall defect, usually to the right of the midline, with visceral herniation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76768%7EOBGYN%2F63613%7EOBGYN%2F97277\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76768 graphicRef63613 graphicRef97277 \">image 2A-C</a>). The adjacent umbilical cord insertion site is normal. The herniated intestinal mass lacks a covering sac and floats freely in the amniotic fluid. The combination of ultrasound examination and MSAFP screening detects at least 90 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 10 percent of cases are associated with malformations outside of the gastrointestinal tract; additional gastrointestinal problems (eg, intestinal atresia, stenosis, perforation, necrosis, malrotation, volvulus) are present in up to 25 percent of cases. The karyotype is abnormal in 1 percent of cases, usually in the setting of associated abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H121861309\" class=\"local\">'Associated anomalies and findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy complications include increased risk of intrauterine growth restriction, fetal demise, spontaneous preterm birth, and bowel thickening and dilation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest offering invasive testing for fetal microarray molecular testing when gastroschisis is associated with additional nongastrointestinal structural abnormalities. Isolated gastroschisis does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain serial ultrasound examinations to follow fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume at two- to four-week intervals since these fetuses are at risk of growth impairment and amniotic fluid abnormalities. We also obtain targeted views of the intra- and extra-abdominal bowel to look for significant dilatation, thickening, or edema. If such changes are observed prior to 34 weeks, we administer a course of glucocorticoids to enhance fetal maturation in the event that preterm delivery becomes indicated, but we do not intervene solely on the basis of bowel wall thickening or dilatation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the increased risk of fetal demise late in pregnancy, we suggest antepartum fetal surveillance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of standard obstetric indications for abdominal delivery, we suggest a trial of labor rather than scheduled cesarean birth for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Cesarean delivery is reasonable if the liver is significantly herniated because of the theoretic risk of dystocia and trauma. We deliver pregnancies complicated by fetal gastroschisis at 37 or 38 weeks of gestation to minimize neonatal morbidity and mortality and avoid the possibility of term (39 to 40 weeks) stillbirth; however, there is no consensus on the optimum timing of delivery of these pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the delivery room, the bowel is wrapped with sterile saline dressings covered with plastic wrap to preserve heat and minimize insensible fluid loss, an orogastric tube is placed to decompress the stomach, peripheral intravenous lines are inserted, and the airway is stabilized. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the neonate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall survival is over 90 percent.
