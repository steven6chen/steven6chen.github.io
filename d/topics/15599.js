After starting the drug and titrating up to the minimum effective dose, response should be monitored over the following two to four weeks. For patients who tolerate the antidepressant but do not respond, we continue titrating up the dose slowly (to avoid side effects) every two to four weeks. For unresponsive patients who do not tolerate the drug, we suggest switching to a different antidepressant.

For patients who do not respond after two to four weeks, the dose is increased to 150 to 200 mg twice daily. The dose is increased further by increments of 100 to 200 mg per day every two to four weeks until the desired clinical response is achieved; the maximum dose is 300 mg twice daily. In clinically urgent situations, dose increases can occur once a week as tolerated.

In two randomized trials, patients with major depression (n = 259 and 131) who received nefazodone for 16 weeks were randomly assigned to either continue the drug or abruptly stop it and start placebo (as part of relapse prevention studies); the incidence of discontinuation symptoms was comparable for the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-modulators-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Thus, nefazodone is not commonly used in United States; generic versions are available, but the brand-name version is no longer manufactured. In addition, the drug has been withdrawn from the market in several countries. Patients receiving the drug should be monitored for signs and symptoms of liver failure (nausea, abdominal pain, jaundice, impaired synthetic function, coagulopathy, and delirium). Although periodic liver function tests (eg, every two to six months) may possibly be useful, there is no evidence that testing prevents hepatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serotonin-modulators-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nefazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nefazodone</a> can cause several other side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 4</a>).
