It is typically performed as an elective procedure in nonlaboring women at or near term to improve their chances of having a vaginal cephalic birth. Women most likely to opt for ECV are those who are well-informed, encouraged to undergo the procedure, believe in its safety, and desire a vaginal birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Women may choose not to undergo ECV because of fear of the procedure, incomplete information, and preference for scheduled cesarean delivery.</p><p>This topic will discuss the procedure for ECV. The causes, diagnosis, management, and outcome of breech presentation are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of issues related to breech presentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effectiveness of ECV is based on its ability to increase the proportion of fetuses in cephalic presentation at birth and decrease the frequency of cesarean delivery. The effectiveness of ECV was illustrated by a 2015 systematic review of eight randomized trials of ECV at term (n = 1308 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Compared with women with breech fetuses who had no attempt at ECV, women who attempted ECV reduced the risk of noncephalic presentation at birth by approximately 60 percent (relative risk [RR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.29-0.61) and reduced the risk of cesarean delivery by approximately 40 percent (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40-0.82). </p><p>Although ECV decreases the frequency of cesarean delivery compared with no ECV, the cesarean delivery rate after successful ECV remains higher than in the general obstetrical population. In a 2014 meta-analysis of observational studies of mode of delivery after successful ECV, the cesarean delivery rate after successful ECV was twice as high as the rate in women with cephalic-presenting fetuses and no ECV (21 versus 11 percent; RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.73-2.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The excess risk of cesarean delivery was due to both dystocia and nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns. </p><p>There is no clear explanation for the increased frequency of dystocia after successful ECV. One theory is that factors common to both breech presentation and successful ECV, such as an unengaged presenting part or small maternal pelvis, are also risk factors for dystocia. Parity also plays a role in risk of dystocia. Multiparous women are more likely than nulliparas to give birth vaginally after successful ECV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The data cited above compared cesarean delivery rates of breech pregnancies after successful ECV with cesarean delivery rates of breech pregnancies with no ECV or with cesarean delivery rates of the general obstetric population. When pregnancies with a cephalic-presenting fetus at birth as a result of successful ECV were compared with pregnancies with cephalic presenting fetuses who spontaneously turned from breech presentation in the third trimester, cesarean rates were similar in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AND FETAL FACTORS ON SUCCESS RATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pooled success rate of ECV was 58 percent in a 2008 systematic review of 84 studies including almost 13,000 version attempts at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Factors associated with lower ECV success rates include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nulliparity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/8-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/9,12,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13,16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral or cornual placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased amniotic fluid volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/13,15,16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,16,18,19</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Descent of the breech into the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/14,18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,20</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/13,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,18</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posteriorly located fetal spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Firm maternal abdominal muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frank breech presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ruptured membranes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tense uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal head not palpable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinner myometrial thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]</p><p/><p>Some of these factors may have also impeded spontaneous version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>In addition to absence of the above unfavorable prognostic factors, the presence of favorable prognostic factors, such as nonlongitudinal lie, unengaged presenting part, and black race, increases ECV success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The fetus in oblique or transverse lie is easier to rotate to a cephalic lie than the breech fetus since only small degrees of rotation are needed and these lies are inherently unstable. In meta-analysis, additional predictors of success were posterior placental location (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.4), complete breech position (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9-2.8), and an amniotic fluid index &gt;10 (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>A possible reason that black race appears to increase the chance of successful ECV is that the presenting part tends to remain high until the onset of labor in black women, and descent of the presenting part into the pelvis makes ECV more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study, neither ultrasound-estimated fetal weight, nor birthweight when birth occurred within a week of the procedure, was associated with ECV success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>While the factors mentioned above impact the average risk of ECV failure, the author's experience is that it is very difficult to predict success or failure in an individual case. Thus, it is reasonable to attempt ECV in women with risk factors for failure, such as obesity. For example, the author attempted ECV in a woman weighing 196 kg, and version was accomplished easily. However, all women should be informed of the possibility of failure, whether or not risk factors for failure are present.</p><p>The author is not aware of evidence to support avoiding ECV of fetuses who exceed any r estimated fetal weight, as long as a trial of labor and vaginal birth is planned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The risk of ECV in the presence of one or more nuchal cords has not been studied. One of the reasons for routine fetal heart rate monitoring during and following ECV is to detect fetal heart rate changes associated with cord entanglement, which appears to be rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The small risk of procedure-related complications must be weighed against the risk associated with persistent breech presentation, including cord prolapse, probable cesarean delivery, and complications of breech birth (whether vaginal or cesarean). Even with scheduled cesarean delivery, complications may result from precipitate labor, leading to vaginal breech birth. </p><p>Cesarean delivery is associated with well-described maternal risks but also risks to the baby, such as transient tachypnea of the newborn and trauma during delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. An increased risk for development of some medical illnesses, such as asthma, has also been hypothesized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Postoperative issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a 2008 systematic review of studies of ECV performed after 36 weeks (84 studies and 12,955 women), serious adverse maternal and fetal outcomes after, but not necessarily related to, ECV were infrequent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64649 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pooled complication rate was 6.1 percent (95% CI 4.7-7.8) and included stillbirth, abruption, emergency cesarean delivery, cord prolapse, transient abnormal fetal heart rate changes, vaginal bleeding, rupture of membranes, and fetomaternal transfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious complications (stillbirth [n = 12], abruption [n = 11]) occurred in 23 cases: pooled risk 0.24 percent (95% CI 0.17-0.34). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pooled risk of fetal death was 0.19 percent (95% CI 0.12-0.27).

For example, there were significant differences among studies in design, patient populations, ECV techniques, and <span class=\"nowrap\">ascertainment/definition</span> of outcomes. Since many studies did not determine relevant outcomes among women with breech presentation who did not have an ECV, a reliable comparison of the risk of ECV versus expectant management could not be performed. In addition, there was no assessment of maternal satisfaction, including degree of discomfort and, possibly, negative psychological effects in the event of failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/7,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33-35</a>]. However, the results were comparable to those in the largest single study, a series of 805 consecutive version attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Randomized trials have been too small to determine whether the overall risk of perinatal mortality is significantly increased or decreased after ECV compared with other approaches. In a 2015 systematic review of these trials, perinatal death occurred in 2 of 644 babies in the attempted ECV group and 6 of 661 babies in the group of breeches that did not undergo ECV (relative risk perinatal death 0.39, 95% CI 0.09-1.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERNATIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of alternatives to ECV, including expectant management, postural maneuvers to facilitate spontaneous version, moxibustion, and acupuncture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Expectant management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for expectant management include (1) expectant management with cesarean delivery (scheduled or unscheduled) of a persistently breech fetus or (2) expectant management with a trial of labor of a persistently breech fetus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of issues related to breech presentation&quot;, section on 'Choosing the route of delivery at term'</a>.) </p><p>Since spontaneous version may occur at any time, even after a failed ECV, a case can be made for delaying cesarean delivery for breech presentation until late pregnancy or early labor. The rate of spontaneous cephalic version following a failed ECV attempt was 6.6 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Risks associated with delaying cesarean delivery include complications of persistent breech presentation, such as cord prolapse or precipitous labor if membranes rupture. There are insufficient data to balance the potential benefits and risks of expectant management, but risks are probably low for most patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Postural maneuvers to facilitate spontaneous version</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no high-quality evidence that maternal postural changes facilitate spontaneous version, but data are limited. In a 2012 systematic review, maternal postural management had no significant effect on the rate of noncephalic births, either for the subgroup in which no ECV was attempted or for the group overall, compared with no intervention (relative risk [RR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.84-1.15; six randomized and quasi-randomized trials, n = 417 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Postural management included techniques such as pelvic elevation using a knee-chest position with or without a full bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>] and a supine head-down position with the pelvis supported by a wedge-shaped cushion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Moxibustion and acupuncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moxibustion refers to a type of Chinese medicine in which an herb is burnt close to the skin of the acupuncture point Bladder 67 (BL67) (Chinese name Zhiyin), located at the tip of the fifth toe. It has been proposed as a means of correcting breech presentation and has been used alone and with acupuncture. The procedure is performed for 20 to 60 minutes, once or twice per day, two to seven times per week for one to two weeks.</p><p>In a 2012 systematic review that compared moxibustion with observation alone in women with a singleton breech fetus, moxibustion did not result in a statistical reduction in noncephalic presentation at birth compared with no intervention (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67-1.19; three randomized trials, n = 594 subjects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There were no serious adverse events, although some women complained of pain, nausea, or an unpleasant odor. Given the significant heterogeneity among the trials, we feel there are insufficient data to recommend for or against use of moxibustion for version of the nonvertex fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">COST-EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ECV has been reported to be cost-effective in studies from the United States and United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In one such study, ECV was cost-effective when compared with a scheduled cesarean delivery for breech presentation when the probability of successful ECV was greater than 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, ECV is offered to women with a noncephalic fetal lie to improve their chances of having a cephalic vaginal birth.</p><p>There is no consensus about contraindications to ECV, except when labor and vaginal birth are contraindicated regardless of fetal presentation (eg, placenta previa, previous Classical cesarean delivery), and no strong evidence on which to base recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

This approach takes advantage of the higher probability of turning the fetus before term, the higher probability that the fetus will remain cephalic if ECV is performed at term, and the high probability that the fetus is mature or nearly mature in the event of complications necessitating urgent cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].

ECV is generally scheduled soon after the minimum gestational age for ECV is reached, but there are no contraindications to attempting ECV at &ge;40 weeks of gestation, although data are sparse.</p><p>For a nonlongitudinal lie (transverse, oblique), we perform ECV later in gestation, usually 39 weeks, in conjunction with induction of labor. (See <a href=\"#H620039933\" class=\"local\">'Nonlongitudinal lies'</a> below.)</p><p>The effectiveness of ECV at term has been established (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> above). ECV before term is more likely to turn the fetus, but the fetus may revert back to its previous presentation, necessitating another attempt at version or cesarean delivery or vaginal delivery as a malpresentation if possible. In the largest trial to address timing of ECV, the Early External Cephalic Version 2 Trial, over 1500 with singleton breech fetuses were randomly assigned to ECV at 34+0 to 35+6 weeks of gestation (early ECV) or at &ge;37 weeks of gestation (term ECV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Repeated ECV attempts were permitted, as was use of tocolytics and regional analgesia; 98 percent of the procedures were performed by experienced practitioners. The major findings from this trial were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early ECV resulted in significantly fewer fetuses in noncephalic presentation at delivery than term ECV (41.1 versus 49.1 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early ECV was slightly less painful than term ECV, but the difference was probably not clinically significant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of cesarean delivery was not significantly reduced with early ECV (52 versus 56 percent; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85-1.02). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications during the procedure occurred in 3 to 4 percent of patients in each group. The most common complication was a nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early ECV did not significantly increase the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (6.5 versus 4.4 percent in patients who underwent late ECV; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97-2.26). The median gestational age at delivery for both groups was 39.1 weeks.</p><p/><p>When a meta-analysis combined these data with data from some small trials, ECV at 34 to 36 weeks reduced the rate of noncephalic presentation at delivery by 20 percent compared with ECV at &ge;37 weeks (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.90); however, the decrease in noncephalic presentation was still not accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the cesarean delivery rate (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-1.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Reasons include the possibility that fetuses in noncephalic presentation in the third trimester have characteristics that place them at higher risk of having <span class=\"nowrap\">antepartum/intrapartum</span> complications necessitating cesarean delivery even if they turn or are turned to cephalic presentation, and a willingness among European hospitals to deliver the term but not the preterm breech fetus vaginally. </p><p>The higher success rate with early ECV needs to be weighed against the possibility of rare complications necessitating delivery of a preterm baby and lack of convincing evidence of a substantial reduction in cesarean delivery. Women should be informed of the relative advantages and disadvantages of early initiation of ECV attempts in order to make an informed choice. This choice is likely to be influenced by the value the woman places on a vaginal cephalic birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H231733293\"><span class=\"h3\">Version during labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ECV appears to be a safe option for women who present in labor with an unengaged breech presentation, intact membranes, normal amniotic fluid volume, and no contraindications to the procedure.

Theoretical advantages of delaying ECV until labor begins are that the maximum time for spontaneous version has been provided, the fetal condition can be monitored continuously from beginning of ECV to birth, cesarean delivery can be performed expeditiously since the woman is already on the labor unit, and administration of anti-D immunoglobulin can be delayed until the neonate's blood type is known (and thus avoided if the neonate is Rh(D)-negative).</p><p>The disadvantages of planned intrapartum ECV are that the opportunity to perform ECV may be lost due to descent of the breech into the pelvis, ruptured membranes, or rapid labor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary measures to enhance success</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several ancillary measures have been evaluated to look for ways to improve the success rate of ECV. The rationale for most of these interventions is to relax the uterus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anterior abdominal wall musculature and thereby enhance the operator's ability to manipulate the fetus. Tocolysis appears to be effective and is the best studied intervention. Regional anesthesia also appears to be effective, but is costly and invasive. </p><p>Other ancillary measures that have been proposed include vibroacoustic stimulation, amnioinfusion, hydration, and analgesia.

She is asked to keep her abdominal muscles relaxed and inform the operator if she feels any discomfort, rather than tensing her abdominal muscles, so that the pressure being used can be modified. Good rapport with the woman is essential to help her relax and keep her from tensing her muscles, which makes it harder to manipulate the fetus. We do not use analgesia or anesthesia. </p><p>The woman is positioned on a narrow, firm examination table with the fetal back towards the operator. A wedge or cushion can be used to tilt the uterus towards the operator and minimize aortocaval compression.</p><p>We administer a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist (eg, salbutamol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a>) to relax the uterus; however, if clinical assessment suggests that ECV is likely to be achieved easily, an initial attempt without tocolysis may be made. In our practice, this accounts for fewer than 20 percent of cases. Favorable clinical features are a lax uterus, easily palpable fetal parts, mobility of the fetus on palpation, and an unengaged presenting breech. We apply powder (eg, cornstarch) over the woman's abdomen to help the operator's hands slide over the skin while manipulating the fetus.</p><p>The breech is disengaged from the pelvis by slowly inserting the fingertips of both hands deeply behind the symphysis pubis to scoop the breech from the pelvis to a position above the sacral promontory. If the woman is steeply tilted on her side against a wall, the operator may sit and steady his or her left elbow on the examination table during the rest of the procedure. The author prefers to begin with a backward somersault, whereas ACOG describes beginning with a forward roll and then attempting a backward roll if the forward roll fails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Backward somersault</strong> &ndash; For the fetus in the left sacrolateral position with planned backward somersault (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F99955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99955 \">figure 2</a>), the operator stands on the woman's left side, on the same side as the fetal back. The breech is held with the edge of the left palm and pushed toward the woman's right flank and upward. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If version is not completed by this maneuver, the head is gently manipulated towards the woman's left flank and downward with the edge of the right hand, taking care to apply most pressure to the breech so that a flexed posture is maintained. Slight back-and-forth movement between the two hands may help promote fetal movement, but generally, pressure on the fetus should be slow and steady rather than repeated pushing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Forward somersault</strong> &ndash; For the fetus in the left sacrolateral position with planned forward somersault (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63535\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63535 \">figure 1</a>), the operator is positioned on the right side of the woman, on the opposite side as the fetal back. The procedure is similar to that described above, except that once the breech has been disengaged from the pelvis, more pressure is applied to the head than the breech, to maintain flexion of the baby.</p><p/><p>The fetal heart rate is auscultated every two minutes, with interruption of the procedure if bradycardia occurs. In one large series, an abnormal fetal heart rate leading to discontinuation of the ECV occurred in approximately 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>If ECV is unsuccessful after five minutes of attempts, we stop and let the woman rest on her side for approximately two minutes before making another attempt if the woman agrees to it.

Some use regional analgesia when initial attempts are unsuccessful. Ultrasound coupling gel can be used to facilitate the procedure rather than powder, particularly when the fetal heart rate is monitored by ultrasound rather than by intermittent auscultation. In a randomized trial, aqueous gel was more effective than powder for reducing maternal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Some obstetricians prefer to use two operators, one manipulating the breech and the other the fetal head.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTPROCEDURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620039836\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the ECV, fetal well-being is evaluated by cardiotocography. We monitor the fetal heart rate (FHR) until it is stable and reactive rather than for a minimum period of time. It is common for FHR tracings to be nonreactive for 20 to 40 minutes after ECV. These changes may reflect the fetal response to a transient period of stress caused by decreased uteroplacental blood flow during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>In a prospective cohort study including 980 women who underwent ECV (60 percent success rate), abnormal FHR patterns occurred in 9 percent and were associated with lower estimated fetal weight and longer duration of the procedure but not with subsequent mode of delivery or fetal distress during labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Two emergency cesarean deliveries were performed because of FHR abnormalities after ECV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620039752\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-D-immune globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts recommend administering anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> to Rh(D)-negative women immediately after ECV. Fetomaternal hemorrhage is almost always less than 30 mL. Given the extremely low risk of a large fetomaternal bleed, performing Kleihauer-Betke or similar tests to quantitate fetomaternal bleeding appears to be unnecessary before administration. In a prospective observational study that performed Kleihauer-Betke tests before and after ECV in over 1000 women, both tests were negative in 1214 women; 30 women (2.4 percent) converted from negative to positive: 20 of these women had only rare fetal erythrocytes on the Kleihauer-Betke smear, 10 had an estimated bleed greater than 1 mL, and 1 had an estimated bleed of 80 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Risk factors for fetomaternal bleeding could not be identified. Others have also reported rare cases of massive fetomaternal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>].

We agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to avoid immediate induction (ie, stabilizing induction) to minimize the chance of reversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The rate of reversion to breech is small, while elective induction is associated with longer labors, increases the risk of neonatal morbidity if performed at &lt;39 weeks of gestation, may increase the risk of cesarean delivery, and can be costly. </p><p>In a cohort study including 627 women, factors that increased the risk of cesarean delivery after successful version included labor induction, less than two weeks between ECV and delivery, high body mass index, and previous cesarean; the overall cesarean delivery rate was 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. In another study of 301 successful ECV procedures, the cesarean delivery rate was 13 percent and the instrumental delivery rate was 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

One study noted that, after unsuccessful ECV, multiparous women were more likely than nulliparas to have spontaneous version to cephalic presentation (12.5 versus 2.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-cephalic-version/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

ECV increases the proportion of fetuses in cephalic presentation at the onset of labor and decreases the frequency of cesarean delivery by approximately 40 percent. However, women who have had a successful ECV are still at increased risk of cesarean delivery because of an increased frequency of dystocia and nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings in labor compared with the general obstetrical population. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECV reduces the risk of noncephalic presentation at birth by approximately 60 percent, but maternal and fetal characteristics influence the rate in individual patients. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Effects of maternal and fetal factors on success rates'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The types and frequencies of risks of ECV are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64649 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We avoid ECV in settings associated with a low likelihood of successful version or increased risk of fetal harm from the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest performing ECV at &ge;36 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). ECV has been proven to have a high degree of safety and success at this gestational age. ECV attempts can be initiated earlier (34 to 35 weeks) to improve the success rate (ie, noncephalic presentation at delivery), but the safety of ECV performed before 36 weeks is less well-established and there is no strong evidence of a reduction in cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"#H69005334\" class=\"local\">'Timing and outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECV can be performed in early labor if membranes are intact and there are no contraindications. (See <a href=\"#H69005334\" class=\"local\">'Timing and outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to ECV is illustrated by the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100240\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100240 \">algorithm 1</a>). We administer a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist prior to ECV to relax the uterus, except in patients in whom clinical assessment suggests that ECV is likely to be achieved easily. One option is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> 0.25 mg subcutaneously 15 to 30 minutes prior to the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Tocolysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not use neuraxial anesthesia routinely; however, it is a reasonable option when ECV with tocolysis alone is unsuccessful. In cases where cesarean delivery is planned in the event of persistent breech presentation, ECV may be attempted at the time of planned cesarean, which can follow unsuccessful ECV while the neuraxial anesthetic is still effective. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Neuraxial anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the ECV, we monitor the fetal heart rate until it is stable and reactive. It is common for fetal heart rate tracings to be nonreactive for 20 to 40 minutes after ECV. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Postprocedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> to Rh(D)-negative women who undergo ECV. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Postprocedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not perform an elective induction immediately after ECV. However, because there is a tendency for a nonlongitudinal (ie, transverse, oblique) lies to recur, after successful ECV of a nonlongitudinal lie, some clinicians perform amniotomy to stabilize the lie, and then induce labor. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Postprocedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial attempt at ECV is unsuccessful, we offer the woman a reattempt of the procedure in one or more days. After two unsuccessful attempts on separate days, we would not try again.
