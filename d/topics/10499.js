Patients who undergo therapy for HCC are at high risk not only for progressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent HCC, but also for liver-related morbidity and mortality. It is important that patients have proper monitoring and assessment of their underlying liver disease, which may have a major impact on long-term survival. Prognostic scoring systems to assess the severity of underlying liver disease in patients undergoing treatment for HCC are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Staging and prognostic scoring systems'</a>.)</p><p>Comprehensive care for patients with cirrhosis includes treatment of the underlying liver disease (eg, antiviral therapy for HBV or HCV), immunization against hepatitis A and HBV (if indicated), and cirrhosis management, including endoscopic screening and treatment for varices.

According to the current (eighth edition, 2017) American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for HCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835 \">table 2</a>), most consider stages IIIB, IVa, and IVb disease to be incurable by resection. These stages are defined by invasion of a major portal or hepatic vein, direct invasion of organs other than the gallbladder, perforation of the visceral peritoneum, and nodal as well as distant metastases. However, hepatic resection for stages IIIB and IVA disease may be considered in a center of excellence because clinical benefits and long-term survival can be achieved in a properly selected, though admittedly small, minority of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Determining the extent of tumor involvement'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A chest CT is recommended to complete the staging evaluation. Although characterized in few reports, the recognized sites of metastatic spread of HCC are lung, bone, peritoneum, adrenals, and lymph nodes. These sites of disease may be demonstrated by standard imaging techniques, but peritoneal disease is frequently missed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Patterns of metastatic spread'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Less than 10 percent of HCC spontaneously rupture. Although these patients have a high likelihood of peritoneal seeding and usually a poor outcome from resection, this is not inevitable. If bleeding can be controlled, a formal staging evaluation should be undertaken, followed by laparoscopic exploration and a subsequent attempt at resection, if feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Determining the extent of tumor involvement'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients undergoing potentially curative partial hepatectomy for HCC, most perioperative deaths, particularly following major hepatectomy, are due to postoperative liver failure. Degree of liver dysfunction is the most important predictor of postresection liver failure and death. There are several strategies, including careful patient selection, tailoring the extent of resection to liver function, and preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) to produce hypertrophy in the future liver remnant and demonstrate the diseased liver is capable of regeneration, that can mitigate these risks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H1061867819\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Portal vein embolization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Postoperative morbidity and mortality'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Eligible candidates for resection must have a suitable tumor location, adequate liver reserve, and a sufficient liver remnant as assessed by clinical and biochemical measures and, in the case of major hepatectomy, by hepatic volumetry. As a general rule, for patients who would potentially have an insufficient future liver remnant but have preserved liver function and no severe portal hypertension, techniques such as preoperative PVE can initiate hypertrophy of the anticipated future liver remnant to enable a major resection that would not otherwise be possible. Failure of the liver to regenerate sufficiently after PVE is an indication that resection should not be pursued.

There is ongoing debate as to which staging system is optimal for use in HCC patients.

This difference in outcome is likely related to a higher competing risk of liver-related mortality in patients with cirrhosis, but may also be related in part to the higher frequency of multicentric HCC in patients with cirrhosis.</p><p>As a general rule, the degree of liver dysfunction, rather than the presence of the cancer, limits long-term survival in patients with cirrhosis with small, early stage HCC. The presence of cirrhosis creates a competing risk of liver-related mortality, as well as contributes to a higher risk of developing a second primary HCC. These principles were illustrated in one multi-institutional series of 591 patients undergoing resection of HCC, of whom 145 survived longer than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma-prognosis-role-of-neoadjuvant-and-adjuvant-therapy-and-posttreatment-surveillance/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. While the status of surgical margins, type of resection, preoperative AFP level, and presence of multiple tumors or microscopic vascular invasion were important predictors of five-year survival, they had no bearing on survival beyond five years.

Historically, HCV sustained viral response (SVR) using IFN-based therapy was associated with significant reductions in HCC recurrence rates after curative treatment. In an analysis of eight studies (totaling 1519 patients) examining the impact of an SVR on outcomes after potentially curative therapy (resection, local ablation), patients who achieved an SVR had significantly improved overall survival (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.11-0.29) and better relapse-free survival (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.40-0.63) than those who did not achieve SVR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma-prognosis-role-of-neoadjuvant-and-adjuvant-therapy-and-posttreatment-surveillance/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. However, all included studies used IFN-based therapy, which is no longer recommended for HCV antiviral therapy. Newer direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents offer increased tolerability and a higher level of viral eradication. Similar to IFN-based therapy, DAAs can reduce the risk of cirrhosis progression and hepatic decompensation in most HCV infected patients; however, it is unclear if the DAAs have similar chemopreventive benefits to IFN-based antiviral therapy. In a contemporary study of 77 patients from four health systems in Spain who underwent DAA therapy after potentially curative therapy (89 percent resection or ablation), recurrence rates were 27.3 percent after a median follow-up of 8.2 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma-prognosis-role-of-neoadjuvant-and-adjuvant-therapy-and-posttreatment-surveillance/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].
