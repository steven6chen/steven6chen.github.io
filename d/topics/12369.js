Osteoporosis is defined as &quot;a skeletal disease characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There are approximately two million fragility fractures in the United States each year: 547,000 vertebral fractures (VFs), 297,000 hip fractures, 397,000 wrist fractures, and 675,000 at other skeletal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Fractures of the spine and hip are associated with chronic pain, deformity, depression, disability, and death. Approximately 50 percent of patients with hip fractures will never be able to walk without assistance and 25 percent will require long-term care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The mortality rate five years after a fracture of the hip or a clinical VF is approximately 20 percent greater than expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The direct cost of incident osteoporotic fractures in the United States was approximately $17 billion per year in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical applications and interpretation of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in evaluating osteoporosis. Other aspects of screening for osteoporosis are reviewed elsewhere.

Non-BMD determinants of bone strength include bone turnover, architecture (size and shape, or bone geometry), microarchitecture (eg, trabecular thickness, trabecular connectivity, trabecular perforation, cortical thickness, and cortical porosity), damage accumulation, matrix properties, mineralization, and mineral properties (eg, crystal size and orientation).</p><p>Investigation of bone quality has provided insight into the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and a better understanding of the mechanism of action of medications used to treat osteoporosis, but with the exception of bone turnover markers, it is not yet possible to measure these routinely in clinical practice. Technologies such as high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and micro-magnetic resonance imaging (micro-MRI) can be used to assess trabecular microarchitecture, but at the present time, these are largely used for research, with no established clinical applications. Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a gray-level textural measurement that can be extracted from a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) image of the lumbar spine with proprietary software; it captures information related to bone microarchitecture that provides an assessment of fracture risk that is independent of bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For now, in the absence of a fragility fracture, bone density is the best predictor of fracture risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">BMD testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone mineral density (BMD) testing is a widely available clinical tool to diagnose osteoporosis, predict fracture risk, and monitor response to therapy. While BMD testing at any skeletal site with a variety of technologies can predict fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], DXA of the spine, hip, and forearm is the only method for diagnosis of osteoporosis in the absence of a fragility fracture and the best method for monitoring changes in BMD over time for a number of reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biomechanical studies have shown a strong correlation between mechanical strength and BMD measured by DXA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In prospective cohort studies, there is a strong relationship between fracture risk and BMD measured by DXA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for the diagnosis of osteoporosis are based on reference data obtained by DXA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

However, the magnitude of fracture risk reduction that is attributable to increases in BMD is variable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accuracy and precision are excellent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; radiation exposure is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DXA TECHNOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) instrument consists of a padded table on which the patient lies and a movable C-arm with a radiograph tube below the patient and a detector above the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59225\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59225 \">figure 1</a>). The radiograph tube generates photon beams of two different energy levels, thus the term &quot;dual-energy.&quot; A collimator below the table limits the scatter of the photons and directs them toward the area of interest. The difference in attenuation (reduction in intensity) of the two photon beams as they pass through body tissue of variable composition distinguishes bone from soft tissue and allows quantification of bone mineral density (BMD). Denser and thicker tissue contains more electrons and allows fewer photons to pass through to the detector. A computer with specially designed proprietary software designed by each manufacturer completes the DXA &quot;system.&quot;</p><p>Radiation exposure to the patient is very small, usually of a similar magnitude to daily background radiation. Radiation scatter beyond the edge of the DXA table is negligible. No shielding of the technologist or the room is necessary. As a safety precaution, the technologist should typically not sit within three feet of the table edge while the patient is being scanned.</p><p>DXA measures bone mineral content (BMC, in grams) and bone area (BA, in square centimeters), then calculates &quot;areal&quot; BMD in <span class=\"nowrap\">g/cm<sup>2</sup></span> by dividing BMC by BA. T-score, the value used for diagnosis of osteoporosis, is calculated by subtracting the mean BMD of a young adult reference population from the patient's BMD and dividing by the standard deviation (SD) of young adult population. Z-score, used to compare the patient's BMD to a population of peers, is calculated by subtracting the mean BMD of an age, ethnicity, and sex-matched reference population from the patient's BMD and dividing by the SD of the reference population. The mean BMD and SD of the reference populations used for these calculations is a critical variable in the determination of T-scores and Z-scores. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'T-score'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'Z-score'</a>.)</p><p>There are significant differences in the technologies used by different manufacturers and sometimes different models of DXA made by the same manufacturer. Manufacturers use different methods for creating dual photon beams (eg, K-edge filtering and voltage switching), different bone edge detection algorithms, different assumptions on body size and tissue composition, different calibration, and different types of photon detectors. Photon beams have different configurations, eg, pencil beam and fan beam. The bone regions of interest (ROI) measured may be different, especially so with the femoral neck. The reference databases used to calculate T-scores and Z-scores may be different. For all of these reasons, it is not possible to make quantitative comparisons of BMD measured on different instruments, especially those made by different manufacturers, unless a cross-calibration study has been done [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF DXA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is used to diagnose osteoporosis or low bone mineral density (BMD), estimate the future risk of fracture, and monitor changes in BMD over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines or evidence-based reviews on the indications for BMD testing have been published by many organizations and are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Recommendations by expert groups'</a>.)</p><p>The guidelines vary according to the populations addressed, clinical risk factors considered, definition of fragility fracture, methodologies used, and weighting of levels of medical evidence versus expert opinion. Of all the published guidelines, those of the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) are the most comprehensive and perhaps the most useful in clinical practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58752 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DXA should not be done in women who are pregnant or may be pregnant because ionizing radiation, albeit it in very small doses, is used. DXA should be postponed until pregnancy is completed. As with any medical test, DXA should not be done unless the results are likely to play a role in the management of the patient. It may not be possible to do a DXA of the hip and spine in some patients due to inability to get on the table. BMD measurement may not be valid in some situations due to skeletal structural abnormalities, such as severe osteoarthritis, surgical hardware, or scoliosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeletal site selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the international standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis be made using the T-score measured by DXA at the femoral neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the NOF and the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) suggest that the diagnosis of osteoporosis in clinical practice be made by DXA using the lowest T-score of the lumbar spine (L1-L4), total proximal femur, or femoral neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. In the hip, Ward's area, trochanter, and other regions of interest (ROIs) should not be used for diagnosis. If the forearm is measured, then the 33 percent radius (one-third radius) may be used for diagnostic purposes if it is the lowest of the skeletal sites measured.</p><p>The rationale for using the lowest T-score of these skeletal sites is that all are good predictors of fracture risk, and the use of the lumbar spine, hip, and forearm BMD is consistent with the original WHO diagnostic classification of 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>We suggest following NOF recommendations (DXA of the lumbar spine and hip). We make the diagnosis according to the lowest T-score measured. Skeletal site selection is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Skeletal site to measure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Reference databases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO recommends calculation of T-score with a uniform, standardized reference database in men and women of all ethnic groups, using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III database for femoral neck measurements in young adult, Caucasian women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In 2013, the ISCD Official Position on this issue was changed to be concordant with the WHO, with the recommendation of both organizations now being that a uniform Caucasian (non-race adjusted) female normative database for women and men of all ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It should be noted, however, that application of ISCD recommendation may vary according to local requirements and that most DXA systems currently in clinical use continue to report T-scores in males using a male reference database. Some DXA facilities may choose to continue to report T-scores in this manner despite the ISCD recommendation. DXA manufacturers should use NHANES III Caucasian data as the reference standard for femoral neck and total hip T-scores, while continuing to use their own databases for the lumbar spine as the reference standard for T-scores. If local reference data are available, they should be used to calculate only Z-scores but not T-scores. The reference database for calculation of Z-score is matched for age, ethnicity, and sex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis may be made in the presence of a fragility fracture, regardless of BMD. A fragility fracture has been defined variously as one that occurs after a fall from the standing position or one that is associated with low BMD and increases in incidence with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The National Bone Health Alliance recommends a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis in patients with elevated risk for future fracture. This includes patients with a hip fracture, regardless of BMD; with vertebral, proximal humerus, pelvis, or some wrist fractures when the T-score is between -1.0 and -2.5; or with a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool [FRAX] 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture 20 percent and greater or 10-year probability of hip fracture 3 percent and greater (United States only) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is preferable to diagnose osteoporosis before the first fracture occurs, just as it is preferable to diagnose hypertension before a stroke or hypercholesterolemia before a myocardial infarction. The WHO has established a classification of BMD according to T-score that has been adapted for clinical use by the ISCD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53999 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].

The WHO selected a T-score of -2.5 or less to define osteoporosis because this identified approximately 30 percent of postmenopausal Caucasian women as having osteoporosis, which is approximately the same as the lifetime risk of fragility fracture in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Premenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO classification should not be used in healthy premenopausal women, because the relationship between BMD and fracture risk is not well established in this population.

A clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis may be made in the presence of a fragility fracture, or when there is low BMD and risk factors for fracture, such as long-term glucocorticoid therapy or hyperparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of premenopausal osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO classification may be used in men age 50 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In younger men, as with premenopausal women, Z-scores (not T-scores) should be used, and a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis should not be made in men under age 50 on the basis of BMD alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In men below age 50 years with low BMD (Z-score &le;-2.0), we diagnose osteoporosis if there is a history of a fragility fracture and, possibly, if other risk factors for osteoporosis (such as glucocorticoid therapy, hypogonadism, or hyperparathyroidism) are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO classification should not be used in children and adolescents. The diagnosis of osteoporosis in children and adolescents cannot be made based on densitometric criteria alone; it requires the presence of both a clinically significant fracture history and low bone mineral content (BMC) or BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A clinically significant fracture history is one or more of the following: long bone fracture of the lower extremities, vertebral compression fracture, or two or more long bone fractures of the upper extremities. Low BMC or BMD is defined as a BMC or areal BMD Z-score that is less than or equal to -2.0, adjusted for age, gender, and body size, as appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Z-scores, not T-scores, should be used, since it is not appropriate to compare the BMD of someone who has not yet achieved peak bone mass to an adult who has.</p><p>BMD measurement in children and adolescents is confounded by factors that include the lack of standardized reference databases for calculating Z-scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], changes in bone size with growth, and variability in the relationships between BMD and chronological age, sexual maturation, and bone age. When technically feasible, patients should have measurements of spine and total body less head (TBLH) BMC and areal BMD prior to initiation of bone active treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The hip (ie, total hip and proximal femur) is not a reliable site for measurement in growing children due to significant variability in skeletal development and lack of reproducible regions of interest. An appropriate reference data set for calculation of Z-score must include a sample of the general healthy population sufficiently large to characterize the normal variability in bone measures that takes into consideration gender, age, and <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Serial BMD testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeat BMD testing is recommended for patients being treated for osteoporosis, with the goal of stabilizing or increasing BMD, and for patients not being treated, in whom evidence of bone loss would lead to treatment. Serial BMD tests showing a change or stability of BMD may provide helpful clinical information, assuming the comparisons are technically valid and the clinician is knowledgeable regarding clinical implications. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Validity of comparisons'</a> below.)</p><p>Whenever possible, the same instrument should be used for serial DXA studies. Comparison of BMD measured with different instruments made by the same manufacturer or by a different manufacturer is discouraged for the reasons noted above. It is not possible to quantify BMD changes on measurements made on different instruments unless a cross-calibration study has been done. Comparison should be done using BMD in <span class=\"nowrap\">g/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> not T-score, since changes in reference databases with software upgrades may cause spurious T-score changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Precision assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The least significant change (LSC) with a 95 percent level of confidence should be established at each bone densitometry center for each technologist by in-vivo precision assessment according to well-established guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. LSC is defined as a change that is 2.77 times the precision error for each measured skeletal site, for each technologist, and it is best expressed as an absolute value <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span>.

A post hoc analysis of data in 2984 women from the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> showed that the greatest fracture reduction occurred in those who gained BMD, although those with stable BMD still had fewer fractures than those who lost BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Loss of BMD more than the LSC is cause for clinical concern and may be associated with poor adherence to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>] or previously unrecognized contributing factors that require additional intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical applications of DXA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) has established a classification of BMD according to T-score that is the worldwide standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53999 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of osteoporosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The WHO recommends that the diagnosis of osteoporosis be made using measurements of DXA at the femoral neck. However, the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) suggest that the diagnosis of osteoporosis be made using the lowest T-score measured by DXA of the lumbar spine (L1-L4), total proximal femur, femoral neck, or one-third radius. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Skeletal site selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The WHO and the ISCD recommend the use of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III Caucasian young adult reference database for calculation of T-score at the hip, using a female database for women and for men. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Reference databases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The WHO criteria should be used for diagnostic classification in postmenopausal women, perimenopausal women, and for men age 50 years and older. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of osteoporosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The WHO criteria should not be used for premenopausal women, men under age 50 years, or children. In these populations, Z-scores rather than T-scores should be used. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of osteoporosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The same DXA instrument should be used for serial BMD testing whenever possible. It is not possible to quantify BMD changes on measurements made on different instruments unless a cross-calibration study has been done. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Serial BMD testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of previously undetected vertebral fractures (VFs) may change the diagnostic classification, fracture risk assessment, and clinical management. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) by DXA is a method of visualizing the spine to detect VFs.
