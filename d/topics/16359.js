Nosocomial SAB occurred significantly more often in the 24 percent of patients who were nasal carriers (1.2 versus 0.4 percent in noncarriers). Genotyping demonstrated that 80 percent of strains causing SAB in nasal carriers were endogenous. On the other hand, nasal carriers had significantly lower rates of SAB-related mortality (3 of 40 versus 13 of 41 (8 versus 32 percent)), a difference that could not be explained by differences in age or comorbidities.</p><p>Differences in the immune response of <em>S. aureus</em> carriers and noncarriers may help to explain the lower mortality among carriers. Support for this hypothesis comes from an observational study in which nasal swabs and serum samples were obtained from healthy blood donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-children-epidemiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Carriers of <em>S. aureus</em> demonstrated effective antibody response against the colonizing strain, whereas the antibody response against other strains was similar to that of noncarriers. This strain-specific immunity may contribute to the improved mortality outcome for nasal carriers compared to noncarriers. How these findings relate to children is unknown.</p><p>A more marked increase in the risk of infection has been described in patients who are colonized with methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) at hospital admission.
