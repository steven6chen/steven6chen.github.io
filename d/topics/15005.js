Pulmonary embolization (mostly asymptomatic) is relatively common, and there are case reports of cerebral venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Arterial thromboses (eg, limb and cerebral) also occur with higher frequency than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in the nephrotic syndrome, and the clinical features and treatment of renal vein thrombosis in adults.

The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a retrospective study of 298 (predominantly adult) patients who presented with the nephrotic syndrome and were followed for a mean of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The absolute risk of venous thrombosis was 1.0 percent per year, which is eight times higher than the age- and sex-matched annual incidence reported in the Worcester DVT study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

This was illustrated in a cohort of 1313 patients with idiopathic glomerular disease due to membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The incidence of venous thromboembolic events was much higher in membranous nephropathy (7.9 percent) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (3.0 percent) than in IgA nephropathy (0.4 percent). The histologic diagnosis remained a predictive factor for thrombosis after adjustment for the degree of proteinuria (which was much higher at presentation in membranous nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [median 5.6 and 3.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> versus 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in IgA nephropathy]) and the serum albumin concentration.</p><p>Patients with membranous nephropathy associated with lupus also appear to be at high risk for thromboembolism. In a study of 66 such patients, venous thromboembolism occurred in 15 (23 percent) at a mean follow-up of 6.9 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Factors other than nephrotic syndrome can contribute to an increased incidence of thromboembolism in patients with lupus, such as antiphospholipid antibodies.

The risk increased by approximately twofold for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> reduction in serum albumin below this threshold. The duration of hypoalbuminemia (less than or more than six months) was not an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism.</p><p/><p>In other causes of the nephrotic syndrome, which are associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism, the risk is particularly increased at a lower serum albumin (below 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L])</span> in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>] but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>].</p><p>The possible role of prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are at increased risk for thromboembolism is discussed below.

In studies of consecutive or unselected patients without membranous nephropathy who underwent venography, the prevalence of RVT ranges from 10 to 50 percent, most frequently due to minimal change disease, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

This was illustrated in a review of discharge diagnoses from hospitals in the United States from 1979 to 2005 in which 925,000 patients had a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among the nephrotic patients, 14,000 (1.5 percent) were diagnosed with DVT while fewer than 5000 had RVT.

Studies evaluating measures of hemostasis activation, such as the plasma level of fibrinopeptide A, which is cleaved from fibrinogen by thrombin, suggest that even asymptomatic nephrotic patients have evidence of ongoing subclinical coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A variety of hemostatic abnormalities have been described, including decreased levels of antithrombin and plasminogen (due to urinary losses), increased platelet activation, hyperfibrinogenemia, inhibition of plasminogen activation, and the presence of high-molecular-weight fibrinogen moieties in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/2,4,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,26-30</a>].</p><p>The tendency to form thrombi at the renal vein in the nephrotic syndrome may be due in part to the loss of fluid across the glomerulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The ensuing hemoconcentration in the postglomerular circulation, which is worsened by diuretic therapy, may promote thrombus formation in patients who are already hypercoagulable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL VEIN THROMBOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous renal vein thrombosis is rare in ambulatory individuals who are not nephrotic or without an underlying renal malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Among 218 patients who presented with renal vein thrombosis in a single center study, 143 had a malignancy (111 with renal cell carcinoma) and 43 patients had the nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Some reported additional causes include trauma (including kidney biopsy), oral contraceptives, hypovolemia (especially in infants), and inherited procoagulant defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>].

In such patients, a pulmonary embolus is usually the only clinical clue to the possible presence of renal or other deep vein thrombosis. Abnormal ventilation-perfusion scans of the lungs indicative or suggestive of pulmonary emboli have been found in as many as 10 to 30 percent of patients with chronic RVT, most of whom are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/1,4,12,13,15,16,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,12,13,15,16,19,20</a>].

Furthermore, in a case report of a patient with unilateral RVT and nephrotic syndrome due to membranous nephropathy, bilateral ureteral catheterization studies showed no difference in protein excretion or creatinine clearance between the two kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute renal vein thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute RVT is most often due to trauma, severe dehydration (especially in infants), or a generalized hypercoagulable state.

In a study of 898 patients with membranous nephropathy, the degree of hypoalbuminemia, but not proteinuria, conferred an increased risk of venous thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H131332569\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Because of the lack of randomized trials, the optimal approach to prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with nephrotic syndrome is not well defined. Furthermore, it is unclear if the findings in membranous nephropathy apply to other causes of nephrotic syndrome, since membranous nephropathy is associated with the highest risk of thromboembolic events and similar large series are not available for the other causes. (See <a href=\"#H131332569\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Some experts would prophylactically anticoagulate all patients with severe nephrotic syndrome, some require an additional risk factor for thrombosis (eg, a prior idiopathic thromboembolic event, immobilization, severe heart failure, morbid obesity, abdominal, orthopedic or gynecologic surgery, genetic thrombophilia [eg, factor V Leiden variant], or atrial fibrillation that alone does not require anticoagulation), and some do not prescribe prophylactic anticoagulation.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The risk of thrombosis is greatest in membranous nephropathy and appears to be proportional to the severity of the hypoalbuminemia. A serum albumin concentration &le;2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (28 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> is the threshold level for increased risk in membranous nephropathy with a 2.13-fold increase in risk for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> decrease in albumin below this level. (See <a href=\"#H131332569\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Most RVT develop insidiously and are asymptomatic. There is no clear evidence that chronic RVT leads to increased proteinuria or worsening kidney function. In contrast, acute RVT presents with signs of renal infarction.
