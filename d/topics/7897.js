The causes of growth failure are complex and include the inflammatory process itself, as well as malnutrition and perhaps treatment with glucocorticoids.</p><p>The pathogenesis, evaluation, and treatment of growth failure or poor weight gain in children and adolescents with IBD will be reviewed here. The assessment and management of micronutrient deficiencies in these patients is discussed separately.

This notion is supported by observed improvements in linear growth that occur after a variety of treatments that reduce inflammation in IBD, including surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adalimumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], or exclusive enteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The improvement in growth is independent of weight gain or reductions in corticosteroid dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. </p><p>Inflammation probably inhibits linear growth through proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Although anti-TNF-alpha antibodies reduce disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], a direct association between TNF-alpha and growth failure remains elusive. IL-6 inhibits insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which modulates the physiologic effects of growth hormone in a pattern suggestive of growth hormone resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14-17</a>] and stimulating lipolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Similarly, in pediatric Crohn disease patients who are <em>CARD15</em> deficient, defects in innate immunity due to auto-antibodies to GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) are associated with linear growth failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The authors speculate that the GM-CSF antibody in these genetically susceptible hosts contributes to increased intestinal permeability. The subsequent endotoxin exposure in turn causes growth hormone resistance as a mechanism for the resulting growth failure. Indeed in their murine model of ileitis they were able to demonstrate liver growth hormone resistance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Malnutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important contributor to malnutrition in IBD is reduced nutrient intake. Other factors include malabsorption, maldigestion, increased energy requirements due to fever and inflammation, gastrointestinal protein loss, and the energy cost of growth. The effects of malnutrition on growth are mediated in part by IGF-1 but through different mechanisms than those triggered by inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduced nutrient intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with IBD often ingest less dietary energy than healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The cause is probably multifactorial. Contributing factors include anorexia (perhaps due to tumor necrosis factor-alpha), the learned association of food with abdominal pain or diarrhea, early satiety (possibly related to decreased gastric emptying), and altered taste (perhaps due to concomitant zinc deficiency or medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metronidazole</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In addition, patients with IBD sometimes choose to or are counseled to avoid certain foods that may exacerbate symptoms, such as fiber in patients with intestinal strictures, or dairy products in patients with concomitant lactose intolerance. </p><p>Nutrient intake may be particularly low during acute exacerbations of IBD. In one study, children acutely ill with IBD consumed 40 to 80 percent of their estimated needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Malabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbohydrate malabsorption is present in some children with active Crohn disease. As an example, 30 to 40 percent of children with IBD have lactose malabsorption, with substantially higher rates in those from ethnic groups with high rates of lactose non-persistence (eg, Asian and African heritage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The rates of lactose malabsorption in children with Crohn disease are probably somewhat higher than in the general population, probably due to small bowel inflammation and enterocyte damage, or bacterial overgrowth. </p><p>Intolerance to lactose is more common among adults with Crohn disease than in the general population, occurring in as many as 40 percent of adults from ethnic groups at low risk for lactose malabsorption, particularly in those with extensive disease in the small bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In contrast, the prevalence of lactose intolerance in adults with ulcerative colitis (UC) is similar to that in controls of similar ethnic backgrounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Historically, fat malabsorption was seen in approximately 30 percent of patients with Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The cause is multifactorial, including small bowel inflammation, decreased bowel length due to surgery, bacterial overgrowth, bile acid deficiency due to disease or resection of the terminal ileum, and use of medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cholestyramine</a> that bind bile acids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Maldigestion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maldigestion (impaired processing of nutrients within the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract) is unusual in patients with IBD but can occur among patients with Crohn disease who have extensive mucosal disease or enteroenteric fistulas. In this setting, ingested nutrients may have insufficient exposure to digestive secretions and enzymes, leading to maldigestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Energy expenditure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resting energy expenditure (REE) in well-nourished children with Crohn disease is not different from values in healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/21,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,33</a>]; the apparent increase in REE in children with Crohn disease is a result of their lower fat-free mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,34</a>]. Studies further demonstrate that REE in children with Crohn disease does not differ between active or inactive disease based on clinical activity index scores or inflammatory markers (eg, lactoferrin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In well-nourished children who underwent ileocolectomy for Crohn disease, REE decreased approximately 5 percent after accounting for the energy expended by the resected intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The increased energy expenditure in active IBD may be mediated by proinflammatory cytokines. A lipid oxidation rate greater than normal has been demonstrated in adults with active Crohn disease, and this increase appears to correlate with disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In children, carbohydrate oxidation decreases and lipid oxidation increases without any change in energy expenditure after the first dose of a biological therapy to reduce inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Enteral protein loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capillary leak within inflamed tissue may result in protein loss. This is the main cause of reduced serum albumin concentrations that are commonly seen in active Crohn disease, and to a lesser extent in ulcerative colitis. Fecal alpha 1 antitrypsin serves as a measure of intestinal protein loss and is increased in children with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Protein depletion is associated with a worse outcome after surgery in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-losing-gastroenteropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein-losing gastroenteropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids may contribute to growth failure, particularly when used during puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Glucocorticoids interfere with endogenous growth hormone secretion and action, and disrupt metabolic processes essential for normal growth, including bone formation, nitrogen retention, and collagen formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H543524649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypogonadism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypogonadism and pubertal delay are common in children with active IBD. As a result, these individuals have decreased linear growth and delayed accretion of lean body mass compared with healthy children of the same age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pubertal delay'</a> below.)</p><p>Because children with pubertal delay usually have delayed bone age, some catch-up growth is possible after the onset of puberty. However, growth during puberty may also be compromised in those with prolonged inflammatory disease, malnutrition, or corticosteroid therapy, so adult height may be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Short stature'</a> below.)</p><p>Inflammatory processes and malnutrition probably both contribute to hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Proinflammatory cytokines directly reduce gonadal sex steroid production and, perhaps, also androgen and estrogen receptor expression in peripheral tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,46,47</a>]. In addition, healthy body weight is an important prerequisite for the onset of puberty. Leptin levels, which are proportionate to body fat, must be sufficient for maturation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) axis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty#H457304473\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;, section on 'Body fat and leptin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Short stature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Linear growth is easily disrupted by inflammation and malnutrition, and growth failure is common in children with IBD. In a population-based study from the United Kingdom, 13 percent of patients with Crohn disease and 3 percent of those with ulcerative colitis (UC) had heights less than the third percentile at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a population-based study from France, 9.5 percent of children with Crohn disease had growth failure and 32 percent had severe malnutrition (defined as height and body mass index [BMI] less than -2 SD [&lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile], respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. During a mean follow-up of six years, growth retardation persisted in nearly 7 percent of patients and malnutrition in 15 percent of patients, despite treatment. Male gender and younger age at diagnosis were associated with short stature at follow-up. It should be noted that this study took place between 1988 and 2004, and the clinical care included more frequent use of corticosteroids and less frequent and later use of biologic agents than is typical in the more current era. Thus, this study population probably does not reflect the beneficial effects of biologic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> on height velocity. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Immunomodulators and biologic agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Serial measurements of height (height velocity) are a particularly sensitive indicator of disease activity or malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Reduced height velocity is present at diagnosis in up to 88 percent of children with Crohn disease, and marked growth delays occur in 20 to 30 percent at some time during their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Five percent of children presenting with Crohn disease will have growth failure as their sole presenting complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], and up to 40 percent have significantly delayed bone age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Height velocity'</a> below.) </p><p>Disruptions of linear growth during childhood probably lead to reduced adult stature in a substantial number of individuals with Crohn disease. A study of young adults diagnosed with Crohn disease prior to age 16 calculated a height deficit of 2.4 cm as compared with estimated target heights, and for almost 20 percent of the subjects the height deficit was more than 8 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, another study that assessed adult height in patients with Crohn disease found that the apparent deficit in adult height in patients with early onset Crohn disease was not significant, once adjustment was made for parental heights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pubertal delay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pubertal delay is common in IBD and depends on the age of onset of IBD. In one series of 11 women with early onset Crohn disease, 75 percent had menarche at 16 years of age or later, but pubertal delay was much less common for children with UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Other series report average delays in puberty onset about 1.5 years for girls and 0.8 years for boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/44,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Hypogonadism'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Poor weight gain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IBD is associated with impaired weight gain, which may be present even early in the course of the disease. A large study of North American children with IBD found that 22 to 24 percent of children with Crohn disease and 7 to 9 percent of those with UC had a low BMI (&lt;5th percentile) at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, 10 percent of children with Crohn disease and 20 to 30 percent of those with UC had an elevated BMI at diagnosis, reflecting population trends in childhood obesity. In some cases, there is also acute weight loss. In an illustrative series, 58 percent of children with Crohn disease and 31 percent of those with UC had weight loss at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduced muscle mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A subset of children and adults with Crohn disease have depleted protein stores (ie, lean body mass), particularly in the active phase of disease, and children with Crohn disease have less lean body mass than height-matched unaffected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/43,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,60,61</a>]. Patients who have lost between 5 and 10 percent of their lean body mass usually have no clinical sequelae. However, loss of lean body mass beyond this threshold is associated with increased morbidity. Children are particularly susceptible to these effects.</p><p>The primary mediators of this effect are inflammation (excessive catabolism, which accelerates protein breakdown), decreased physical activity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corticosteroid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Inadequate protein intake may also affect muscle mass in growing children. Studies of children with Crohn disease demonstrated that increased protein intake resulted in increased nitrogen retention, increased amino acid incorporation into body protein stores and decreased amino acid loss via oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/61,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,63</a>]. Low protein intake is less likely to cause reduced muscle mass in adults, unless the deficiency is severe and prolonged (starvation).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone disease (osteoporosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> osteomalacia) is a common problem in adults with IBD, and the rate does not differ among patients with Crohn disease as compared with those with UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Risk factors include corticosteroid use <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disease activity and age, as well as pubertal delay and possibly deficiencies of calcium and vitamins D and K [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>]. Prevention and treatment of bone loss in IBD consists of attempting to reverse or minimize these factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Children and adolescents with IBD also tend to have reduced bone mineral density (BMD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. This is more common among those with Crohn disease than those with UC, and may be present at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>]. It is unclear whether modest decreases in bone density predict fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], and limited information is available to guide management. Nonetheless, because of the high frequency of bone disease in adult patients with IBD and its effects on quality of life, we recommend close attention to bone health throughout life. Prevention, monitoring and treatment of bone disease in children and adolescents with IBD are discussed in a separate topic review.

Prompt recognition of reduced height velocity in children with IBD allows for intervention to optimize nutrition and address the inflammatory disease, and may prevent permanent growth failure. Growth parameters should be monitored in all children. Further evaluation is indicated in those with growth failure, as discussed below. Evaluation for specific micronutrient deficiencies depends on risks, as determined by overall nutritional status and disease activity and location, which is discussed in a separate topic review (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73559 \">table 1</a>).

Body mass index (BMI) for age and height velocity should be calculated. In our practice, we perform these measurements at least every four months for patients with quiescent disease, and more frequently for those with active disease or evidence of growth failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61093\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61093 \">table 2</a>). Referral to a specialist in nutrition can be helpful, particularly in severe cases. Radiographic determination of bone age is a valuable component of the evaluation for patients with growth failure, and results are abnormal in up to 40 percent of children with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Height percentiles should also be interpreted in the context of the child's genetic potential, usually estimated based on the midparental height. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H64002967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Prediction of adult height'</a>.)</p><p>Height velocity measurements are the most sensitive parameter for detection of growth abnormalities during IBD in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/50,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,52</a>]. Height velocity can be calculated from two or more serial measurements of height, ideally taken three to six months apart and expressed as growth in <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span>. Any child older than two years whose height velocity is less than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> probably has growth failure because at least 95 percent of healthy children grow faster than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. During puberty, peak height velocity is 6 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> in boys, and 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> in girls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'Growth velocity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Is the child's height velocity impaired?'</a>.)</p><p>To determine if a child's height velocity is appropriate for age, height velocity can be plotted on a standard curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96367%7EPEDS%2F96366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96367 graphicRef96366 \">figure 1A-B</a>). No specific thresholds for intervention have been established, but we suggest that children with IBD and height velocity below the 10th percentile should be assessed for nutritional deficits, and more intensive nutritional intervention or change in IBD therapy should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Intervention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Body mass index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age-specific percentiles for BMI are determined by plotting on a standard chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60784%7EPEDS%2F68478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60784 graphicRef68478 \">figure 2A-B</a>) or by using a calculator for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-percentiles-for-boys-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-percentiles-for-girls-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). The usual threshold for defining underweight is a BMI below the 5th percentile for age, but this cutoff is insufficient for identifying growth abnormalities in children with IBD. Instead, we suggest that progressive decreases in BMI percentiles, or a BMI below the 10th percentile for age should prompt evaluation and nutritional intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analysis of dietary intake for three- to five-day periods helps to assess the total calories, protein, and micronutrients consumed, and highlights nutrient deficiencies that may be associated with inadequate intake.</p><p>In our practice, we generally analyze dietary intake in children who are not gaining weight appropriately and in whom it is unclear whether this is due to inadequate calories or malabsorption. However, most children who are not gaining weight appropriately report that they have no appetite and find it difficult to eat; thus, formal assessments rarely contribute to clinical decision-making.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Body composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are markedly underweight (eg, BMI&lt;5th percentile for age), measures of body composition can help to characterize the severity. Techniques include triceps skin fold thickness measurements, which reflect body fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67683 \">table 3</a>) and mid-arm cross sectional area, which reflects lean body mass. Several other measures for determining body composition are available, including bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Whether any of these measures provides clinically important information that is any better than a simple visual assessment of muscle mass has not been established. The BMI measurement alone is usually a sufficient tool for clinical decision-making, so additional measurements of body composition are not usually necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-body-composition-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of body composition in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimizing nutrition is an important step in managing growth failure. The intensity of the intervention can be adjusted to the severity of the growth failure.</p><p>Effective treatment of the inflammatory process itself is also critical to restoring growth. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Inflammation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All individuals with IBD should be given dietary advice to ensure a balanced diet with adequate calories to optimize growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. For patients with active disease or malabsorption, energy intake goals will often be higher than for the general population. Children with growth failure also have increased energy requirements for catch-up growth, even if their IBD is inactive. Catch-up growth typically requires 125 to 150 percent of the recommended daily allowance for energy, and 2.4 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day of protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>To avoid unnecessary reduction of energy intake, dietary restrictions for patients with IBD should only be recommended when there is clear evidence of intolerance (eg, an abnormal lactose breath hydrogen test) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Minimizing the use of glucocorticoids is appropriate in all patients to avoid growth failure and bone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These adverse effects of glucocorticoids must be balanced against their potential therapeutic value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with mild growth failure (decreased height velocity), the initial intervention is to provide more intensive dietary advice to increase energy intake, sometimes including liquid supplements taken by mouth. Calculations of energy requirements should be based on ideal body weight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary energy requirements in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Small nonrandomized studies in children and adults support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. However, the efficacy of nutritional counseling in IBD has not been carefully studied, and the energy and nutrient increases achieved through this approach are probably modest. Addition of a liquid supplement taken by mouth supplying 35 to 50 percent of estimated energy needs effectively promotes weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Supplemental enteral nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with marked growth failure who are unable to increase their energy intake voluntarily may benefit from liquid nutritional supplements. This type of intensive nutritional intervention can help prevent or reverse the consequences of malnutrition, including growth failure, pubertal delay, and bone disease.</p><p>When supplemental enteral feedings are used, the child usually eats freely during the day and then passes a nasogastric tube at night to administer formula while sleeping. Nutritional goals are generally from 100 to 150 percent of the recommended daily allowances for height-age for both energy (85 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">kCal/kg</span> per day) and protein (2.4 to 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day); this usually translates to 1000 to 1500 kCals of formula nightly. We find that administering a set amount of formula is easiest and most successful, rather than adjusting the formula intake based on the voluntary intake of food. Deficiencies in vitamins and minerals should be assessed and replaced by supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The type of formula used (elemental versus polymeric) is not important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This issue has been best examined in the setting of exclusive enteral nutrition, which is discussed below.</p><p>In a small nonrandomized study of prepubertal children with Crohn disease, nocturnal feedings yielded a mean weight gain of 11.75 kg and a mean height gain of 6.98 cm over one year, whereas matched control subjects had no change in weight and height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Another study demonstrated that supplemental feeding administered as little as one month out of every four results in improved weight gain and height velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. A third study, performed retrospectively, suggested that use of supplementary nasogastric feeds during remission of IBD improved linear growth and prolonged remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Improved intake of energy, calcium, and vitamin D is also an important step in preventing and treating bone disease.

A retrospective review found that treatment with infliximab or adalimumab is more likely to be associated with growth improvement when initiated at earlier stages of puberty (ie, Tanner stage 1 to 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In children with localized treatment-resistant Crohn disease, surgical resection of the inflamed bowel segment can be effective in restoring growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,86</a>]. A randomized trial of early treatment with 6-mercaptopurine did not show beneficial effects on growth as compared with conventional treatment with glucocorticoids, but the sample size was small, and the subjects had minimal growth retardation at randomization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> or other biologic agents are used, their efficacy in treating growth failure is probably more closely related to their antiinflammatory effects rather than to reductions in corticosteroid use. This was suggested by the surgical study cited above in which growth failure improved after surgery although corticosteroid doses were kept constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].
