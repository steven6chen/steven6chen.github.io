It readily crosses the placenta. Exposure to DES during a critical period of organogenesis disorganizes the developing uterine muscle layers; causes maldevelopment of the uterotubal junction; and prevents stratification of the vaginal epithelium and resorption of vaginal glands, resulting in vaginal adenosis. In murine studies, the mechanism for DES-induced adenosis is blocked expression of Trp63 in M&uuml;llerian duct epithelium at epithelial estrogen receptor alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. DES has also been shown to alter normal programming of the gene families Hox and Wnt, which affect differentiation of the reproductive tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p>DES was initially used for postpartum lactation suppression and treatment of postmenopausal symptoms, but quickly became an accepted intervention for prevention of miscarriage, premature birth, and other pregnancy problems. It is estimated that five million pregnant women worldwide received DES to improve pregnancy outcome. Although clinical trials in the 1950s demonstrated that it was ineffective for prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], it remained in use until 1971 in the United States and until the early 1980s in some other countries. In 1971, in-utero exposure to DES was linked to the occurrence of vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma in female offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], which prompted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to advise against its use in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Subsequently, other health effects, such as pregnancy complications and male genitourinary tract abnormalities, were also linked to in-utero DES exposure. DES is no longer commercially available for human use in North America.</p><p>DES remains the only firmly established transplacental carcinogen in humans. Because of this risk, it is important to continue to monitor exposed offspring and their mothers for long-term health effects. DES is also important as the model agent for endocrine disrupting chemicals and their effects on fetal development and adult health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Aberrant DNA methylation has been proposed as a molecular mechanism whereby endocrine disruptors such as DES regulate developmental programming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WOMEN WHO RECEIVED DES DURING PREGNANCY (DES MOTHERS)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565946343\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast cancer risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There appears to be a slightly increased incidence of breast cancer among women who were prescribed DES during pregnancy (DES mothers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. The largest and most comprehensive study on this topic compared long-term cancer risk in a database of 3844 women prescribed DES during pregnancy to an unexposed comparison group of 3716 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Women who took DES had a small increased risk of breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.07-1.52); looked at in another way, their lifetime risk of breast cancer increased from 1 in 8 (about 12 percent) to 1 in 6 (about 17 percent). There was no evidence of an interaction between the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy and DES in relation to breast cancer risk, and the risk did not increase over time. The higher risk did not appear to be due to inherent characteristics of the women who were given DES (ie, women with pregnancy problems) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].<br/></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565955473\"><span class=\"h2\">Other cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who were prescribed DES during pregnancy are <strong>not</strong> at increased risk of ovarian or endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565946350\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large study of 3857 exposed and 3818 unexposed reported no substantial increase in mortality rates among women prescribed DES compared with unexposed women with the exception of breast cancer mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All cause mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98-1.16)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality from cerebrovascular disease (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.78-1.47)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality from cardiovascular disease (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83-1.16)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality from breast cancer (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.96-1.69) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer mortality (all types) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94-1.23)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WOMEN EXPOSED TO DES IN-UTERO (DES DAUGHTERS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) in pregnant women to prevent miscarriage began in approximately 1938 and was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication in 1947 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

At some point, DES daughters will all become postmenopausal and fertility and pregnancy impacts will no longer be part of clinical care.

However, the cumulative lifetime incidence of CCA is very low, estimated to be 1 case per 1000 to 2000 DES-exposed daughters. A registry established to track cases of cervical and vaginal CCA worldwide included 720 cases as of 2007; 58 percent of these cases were women exposed to DES in-utero and an additional 10 percent had received another hormone or unknown medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Most cases of DES-associated CCA have been diagnosed among females in their late teens and twenties, with a range of 7 to 48 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. By comparison, most cases of CCA among non-exposed women occur postmenopausally, although early and late age peaks have been reported in non-exposed women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>There are no data to allow clear conclusions about the upper age limit for the diagnosis of DES-associated CCA, especially regarding late risk in DES daughters after menopause. Although there is no firm evidence, a possible increase in incidence of DES-associated CCA at age &ge;40&nbsp;years has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. For this reason, DES daughters should be screened for CCA throughout their lives (see <a href=\"#H19311264\" class=\"local\">'DES daughters'</a> below). Oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are unlikely to be a co-factor in the development of CCA of the vagina or cervix; however, if there is an association, it is less than that reported for squamous or non-clear-cell adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation of CCA may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge, or a gross red, fleshy lesion on the vagina or cervix. Ninety percent of cases of CCA related to DES have been diagnosed at Stage 1 or 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Survival rates at these stages are good (80 to 90 percent), but recurrences as late as 20 years following diagnosis have been documented.

The excess risk may be due to an increase in the size of the cervical transformation zone, leading to greater susceptibility to human papillomavirus infection. </p><p>The risk of cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) is increased almost twofold in DES-exposed daughters (cumulative risk to age 55 years: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 5.3 versus 2.6 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 2.10, 95% CI 1.41-3.13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The risk was higher up to age 45 (age &lt;45 HR 2.47; CI 1.55-3.94), but was not apparent in women age 45 and above, based on an imprecise estimate. Risks were higher in women exposed earlier in gestation and in those with documented vaginal epithelial changes. </p><p>A study from the Netherlands reported an increased risk of CIN1 among approximately 12,000 DES-exposed daughters compared with expected rates from the general population, but no overall increase in CIN2, 3, or invasive cervical cancer was found. An increased risk of CIN2 was found among DES-exposed daughters with <span class=\"nowrap\">vaginal/cervical</span> epithelial changes, but the authors speculated that this increase, as well as the increase in CIN1, was likely due to increased screening in these daughters. DES exposure was originally ascertained by self-report as opposed to medical records [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], which is a limitation of this study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565955742\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available data on risk of breast cancer in women exposed to DES in-utero are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/28,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,33,34</a>]. There is no evidence of a statistically increased risk of breast cancer before age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. An increased risk in women &ge;40 years of age exposed to DES in-utero was observed in a prospective cohort study from the US (3.9 versus 2.2 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 1.82; 95% CI 1.04-3.18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], but not in another similar but larger study from the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Several factors could explain these discordant findings, including chance. There were only 102 incident invasive breast cancers in the US study and 165 in the Dutch study. The risk of breast cancer in DES daughters in the Dutch study may have been attenuated because of misclassification of exposure status since DES exposure was not as rigorously confirmed as it was in the US study. Bias might result if the development of breast cancer (particularly over the age of 40 years) selectively affected exposed and unexposed women who were lost to follow-up. The age distribution in the two studies was slightly different; the Dutch cohort was younger than the US cohort. The Dutch study compared breast cancer risk in DES-exposed women with the risk in the general population, whereas DES daughters might differ from the general population with respect to breast cancer risk factors.</p><p>Continued surveillance is warranted to determine whether the increase in breast cancer risk continues as these women age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565955984\"><span class=\"h2\">Other cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little evidence for an increased risk of other cancer sites among DES-exposed daughters, but this may be due to the relatively small numbers of exposed daughters in existing cohort studies of DES. One study found no overall increase in risk of all cancers combined, or individual cancers, except for breast cancer and CCA, when comparing rates in the exposed daughters to expected rates based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) population (standardized incidence rate ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.94-1.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another study found an increase in melanoma among exposed daughters before but not after age 40 years (before age 40 years: standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.08&ndash;2.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The columnar epithelium may cover the surface or form glands within the stromal wall. As a result, the squamocolumnar junction, which is normally near the external os or in the endocervical canal, can be in the vagina. DES is one cause but not the only cause of adenosis; it may be related to other hormones or environmental chemicals (endocrine disrupters) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In a large cohort study of DES-exposed women (the National Cooperative Diethylstilbestrol Adenosis [DESAD] project), one-third of these women had vaginal and cervical adenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].
