GCA affects only older adults, with a peak incidence between ages 70 and 79 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Many of the clinical features of the disease result from vascular inflammation of the small extracranial branches of the carotid arteries. The disease can be generalized, however, and involve the aorta, leading to aneurysms of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, and large arteries, resulting in ischemic symptoms of the extremities.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of GCA are reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179055075\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1518118106\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1360933562\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with positive biopsy or imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy and should be instituted promptly once the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) is strongly suspected, especially in patients with recent or threatened visual loss. A temporal artery biopsy or other diagnostic procedure should be obtained as soon as possible, but treatment should not be withheld while awaiting the performance or results (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>). In patients who have developed or are at high risk for adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, glucocorticoid-sparing strategies include the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> (TCZ) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX). (See <a href=\"#H4159164883\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid-sparing agents'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1588648971\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with negative biopsy and imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases where the clinical scenario for GCA is compelling but the diagnostic workup is negative, the diagnosis of GCA may be arrived at on clinical grounds. Such patients are generally treated the same as patients with proven GCA. Workup should have included negative temporal artery biopsy or biopsies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> color-coded duplex ultrasonography, and, if indicated, imaging studies for large vessel involvement. Alternative diagnosis (eg, malignancy and infection) should have been excluded.</p><p>In such patients, the management of recurring headache, constitutional symptoms, or elevated acute phase reactants during the course of a glucocorticoid taper can be problematic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1408267668\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4271942575\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Though never studied in a placebo-controlled manner, the effectiveness of glucocorticoids for the management of GCA has been well established by decades of clinical experience. Glucocorticoids produce prompt improvement in systemic symptoms and signs and, if expeditiously administered, can prevent the most sinister potential complication of GCA, that of sight loss.</p><p>The efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy for the prevention of visual loss was shown in a retrospective study of 245 patients with biopsy-proven GCA, all treated with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Permanent visual loss was found in 34 patients (14 percent), which had occurred in 32 of the 34 patients before initiation of glucocorticoids. Of the two cases of de novo visual loss that developed after glucocorticoids were started, one occurred eight days into treatment, and the other occurred three years after glucocorticoids were first administered and one year after their discontinuation when the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was normal, and was therefore unlikely related to GCA. In another study of 144 patients with biopsy-proven GCA described in the ophthalmologic literature, none of the 53 patients with normal vision at presentation lost vision after initiation of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Of the 91 patients with sight loss at presentation, nine experienced further visual loss after beginning glucocorticoids, all within five days of the start of treatment. Thus, if vision is intact at the time of the diagnosis of GCA, treatment with glucocorticoids effectively reduces the risk of sight loss to less than 1 percent.</p><p>Treatment of GCA requires daily glucocorticoid administration. The importance of daily dosing was demonstrated in the course of a study on the use of MTX for the management of GCA in which a rapid glucocorticoid taper to an alternate-day dose was associated with new sight loss in 8 of 98 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In another study of regimens for glucocorticoid dosing, daily doses were more effective than alternate-day doses for symptomatic management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Though the efficacy of glucocorticoids for the treatment of GCA is indisputable, an optimal regimen for a starting dose and subsequent taper (one that would prevent visual loss and minimize glucocorticoid-related side effects) has not been formally evaluated. Published recommendations in this regard are consensus-based [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Without visual loss at diagnosis</strong> &ndash; If there are no symptoms or signs of ischemic organ damage (eg, visual loss), we suggest initial treatment with the equivalent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> administered in a single daily dose. A population-based study with 120 patients with GCA found that all patients responded rapidly to a median initial dose of 60 mg of prednisone daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Earlier studies found doses in the range of 20 to 30 mg of prednisone per day to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In a retrospective study including 230 patients with either polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) or GCA, a subgroup analysis of patients with GCA stratified by three different prednisone dose ranges (10 to 20 mg daily, over 20 and under 60 mg daily, and 60 to 90 mg daily) found no differences in terms of the number of remission, relapse rates, and progression of visual complications once treatment was started [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Ophthalmologists have tended to recommend higher doses, in the range of 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If potentially reversible symptoms persist or worsen, the dose can be increased until symptomatic control is achieved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unless there are ocular symptoms or signs at presentation, there is insufficient evidence to justify the upfront use of intravenous pulse glucocorticoids in patients without visual loss at presentation. A randomized trial with 164 patients with GCA (without ocular involvement at presentation) found no differences in the cumulative glucocorticoid doses or the number of GCA complications when comparing three different glucocorticoid protocols, two of which consisted of different pulse glucocorticoid regimens on a background of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (240 mg intravenous pulse of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> followed by 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> oral prednisone or 240 mg intravenous pulse methylprednisolone followed by 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> and the other of which consisted of only oral prednisone (0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another small randomized study of 27 patients without ocular involvement found that adding initial pulse glucocorticoid therapy resulted in a reduced total exposure to glucocorticoids and a lower relapse rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Neither of these randomized trials, however, was designed to assess the outcome of ocular complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients usually report dramatic improvements of many GCA-related symptoms (eg, headache, fever, malaise) within 24 to 48 hours of glucocorticoid administration. Laboratory measures of disease activity such as the ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP) usually improve substantially within a few days of the institution of therapy, as well; the CRP declines much more rapidly than the ESR. The diagnosis of GCA should be reevaluated in patients who are resistant to adequate glucocorticoid therapy, especially in situations where temporal artery biopsy and imaging studies have been negative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Threatened or established visual loss at diagnosis</strong> &ndash; If there is a strong suspicion of GCA as the cause of visual symptoms or signs, we suggest the use of intravenous &quot;pulses&quot; of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, customarily administered as 500 to 1000 mg intravenously each day for three days, followed by oral therapy with 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (maximum of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> as recommended above for uncomplicated GCA. Patients with presumed or proven GCA and incident diplopia should also be treated with an initial intravenous pulse of high-dose glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Though not validated in rigorous studies, this approach is used because of the crucial importance of preventing visual impairment due to GCA, which, once established, is rarely reversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The stark reality of such visual loss is that patients seldom recover useful vision in an affected eye. In a retrospective review of 84 patients (114 eyes) with variable degrees of GCA-associated visual loss (due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [AION] in over 90 percent of patients), there were no differences in improvement in visual acuity when comparing patients who received intravenous glucocorticoids followed by oral therapy (41 patients) with patients who received only oral glucocorticoids (43 patients). Improvement in visual acuity was only observed in 4 percent of eyes (three patients treated with intravenous glucocorticoids and two with oral glucocorticoids), as judged by improvement in both visual acuity and central visual field (by kinetic perimetry and Amsler grid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Numerous other studies testify to this poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Of note, improvement perceived by patients and noted on visual acuity tests may not reflect true recovery of retinal or optic nerve function but rather eccentric compensation for acquired, permanent visual deficits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preexisting sight loss can progress, despite initiation of glucocorticoid therapy, in approximately 10 percent of patients, usually within the first week of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid tapering</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130373288\"><span class=\"h4\">Approach to dose reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We maintain the starting dose of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for at least two, but not more than four, weeks. Although symptoms are typically controlled promptly by therapy, disease flares are the rule if the glucocorticoids are tapered too quickly. If the initial dose of prednisone is 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> it can generally be reduced to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> after two weeks and to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> at the end of four weeks, assuming symptoms and signs have receded and the ESR and CRP have declined to normal or near-normal ranges. Subsequently, the dose can gradually be reduced by 5 mg every two weeks to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and then by 2.5 mg every two weeks to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> if there are no flares of disease activity. After achieving a daily dose of 10 mg, the prednisone taper should be slowed, such that patients remain on progressively decreasing doses over the ensuing 6 to 12 months. Tapering by 1 mg decrements each month once the daily dose is less than 10 mg can be considered.</p><p>Relapses of disease are unusual at doses higher than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> but become more frequent at doses below that level. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Relapse'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Monitoring disease activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most challenging aspects of GCA treatment is the accurate identification of relapses in the setting of the glucocorticoid taper. Acute phase reactants such as the ESR and CRP can be useful adjuncts to clinical decision making. Especially during initial treatment, measurements of the ESR and CRP prior to each decrease in glucocorticoid dose are ideal.</p><p>If elevations of the ESR or CRP are not accompanied by symptoms or findings suggestive of recrudescent GCA, reflexive changes in the glucocorticoid dose based upon the test results alone can prolong the period of glucocorticoid therapy unnecessarily, increase the cumulative glucocorticoid dose, and heighten the likelihood of treatment-related adverse effects.</p><p>Both the ESR and CRP are imperfect biomarkers in GCA. The ESR usually rises with age (a value of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> may be normal for an 80-year-old), and, in some patients, abnormalities of serum proteins unrelated to GCA can spuriously elevate the ESR. Examples include monoclonal gammopathies and hypergammaglobulinemia secondary to liver disease. Though the ESR and CRP have not been directly compared for the assessment of disease activity in GCA, clinical experience argues strongly that the CRP is more useful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;, section on 'ESR and C-reactive protein'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;, section on 'Clinical use'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapse of GCA should be suspected when patients have a return of symptoms that recall their original presentations, when new symptoms compatible with the diagnosis of GCA or PMR occur, or when there is a striking elevation of acute phase reactants. Elevations of the ESR or CRP do not always indicate a disease flare, but their occurrence should trigger close clinical follow-up and questioning of patients about symptoms of recurring disease.</p><p>For relapses of disease activity, an increase in the glucocorticoid dose should be appropriate to the nature of the relapse. For visual symptoms attributable to GCA (generally occurring within the first weeks of the initial diagnosis of disease), an increase of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose to 30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and even pulse doses may be needed. Much smaller increments in the daily dose of prednisone, between 5 to 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> are appropriate for PMR symptoms.</p><p>Reports on the incidence of relapses in GCA, all assembled from tertiary care centers, vary widely, from 34 to 74 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. This range is due in part to a lack of consensus regarding the definition of what constitutes a relapse. In some analyses, asymptomatic rises in the acute phase reactants were counted as a flare of GCA, and, in others, a recrudescence of symptoms only, unaccompanied by rises in the acute phase reactants, was included. All studies construed the appearance of PMR as a relapse of GCA.</p><p>Notwithstanding the heterogeneity of the data collection, there is agreement on several clinical points. The majority of relapses in GCA occur at doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and are most prevalent during the first year of treatment. Headache and PMR are the most common symptomatic expressions of relapse. Other symptoms include jaw claudication, the development of ischemic limb symptoms, and the recurrence of constitutional symptoms. Persisting elevations of the acute phase reactants in the absence of alternative explanations and especially if accompanied by constitutional symptoms should prompt consideration of underlying large vessel vasculitis and advanced diagnostic imaging. Finally, and importantly, the occurrence of sight loss after an initial course of high-dose glucocorticoid treatment, administered daily, is exceptional. (See <a href=\"#H4271942575\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p>An initially intense acute phase response, as manifested by anemia and significant elevations of the ESR and CRP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], has been associated with an increased risk of relapse.</p><p>Late relapses (and recurrences) of GCA are described, leading to protracted glucocorticoid treatment. In one study, one-half of patients were still on treatment after five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other estimates of the total duration of glucocorticoid treatment are in the range of one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], which is more consonant with clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3445639642\"><span class=\"h3\">Risks of glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risks of high-dose and of chronic glucocorticoid therapy are well known. A population-based study of 120 GCA patients diagnosed between 1950 and 1991 found that 86 percent experienced at least one adverse event, which included posterior subcapsular cataracts, fractures, infections, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The median duration of treatment to reach a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose of 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> was six months. Adverse events correlated with increased age and cumulative glucocorticoid dose but not with a higher initial dose. Other side effects of glucocorticoids, less frequently enumerated but of no less concern, or even explicit morbidity for the patient, include weight gain, hair loss, and capillary fragility. The latter can be especially problematic in older adults on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is the potential toxicities of glucocorticoids, despite their unquestionable value in the treatment of GCA, particularly for the prevention of sight loss, that has led to the search for glucocorticoid-sparing strategies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4159164883\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCOCORTICOID-SPARING AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjunctive treatment for giant cell arteritis (GCA) should be considered in situations where glucocorticoid-related toxicities have ensued or are anticipated.

The same is true for the emergence of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which needs only low-dose glucocorticoids for treatment. Recurring symptoms should be clearly attributable to GCA and other diagnoses excluded before adding a glucocorticoid-sparing agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3326686507\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of agent and practical considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TCZ or MTX are options for use as glucocorticoid-sparing agents. On the basis of published data and clinical experience, we favor TCZ as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent if there are no contraindications. (See <a href=\"#H179055212\" class=\"local\">'Tocilizumab'</a> below.)</p><p>A pragmatic concern with the use of TCZ in the management of GCA pertains to its effects on the acute phase reactants. Interleukin (IL)-6 is a major driver of the acute phase response through its induction of hepatic synthesis of acute phase proteins (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>). Blockade of IL-6 usually completely normalizes the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), with the result that the assessment of GCA in a patient on TCZ must rely on clinical evaluation and, in the case of large vessel involvement, periodic imaging studies. There continues to be an unfulfilled need for a reliable marker for active disease in GCA.</p><p>Whether TCZ should be deployed for the routine care of all patients with GCA (that is, at the start of treatment, simultaneous with glucocorticoids) is an evolving issue. Though in the randomized controlled study of TCZ, the drug was initiated at the start of treatment, additional studies are needed to fully define the drug's long-term safety and efficacy (see <a href=\"#H179055212\" class=\"local\">'Tocilizumab'</a> below). At this time, we reserve TCZ for the management of individual patients who are at high risk for glucocorticoid toxicity, who incur glucocorticoid-related side effects during the course of treatment, or who experience relapsing disease.</p><p>Though MTX is of but modest efficacy, its use can be supported in the individual patient. Concurrent use of MTX and higher glucocorticoid doses warrants use of prophylaxis for <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii </em>pneumonia (PCP) (see <a href=\"#H2161879159\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of opportunistic infections'</a> below). The routine addition of MTX to glucocorticoid therapy for GCA is not recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1758244953\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment options</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179055212\"><span class=\"h3\">Tocilizumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of TCZ for the treatment of GCA was suggested by evidence that IL-6 is important in disease pathogenesis.</p><p>A growing number of case reports, small case series, and a phase 2 trial reported efficacy of TCZ, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, for the management of GCA patients with refractory disease or glucocorticoid-related toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. An industry-sponsored randomized trial confirmed the effectiveness of TCZ as a glucocorticoid-sparing intervention in GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this study, 251 patients with GCA were randomized to receive either weekly or every-other-week subcutaneous TCZ injections, combined with a 26-week <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> taper, or placebo combined with a prednisone taper over a period of either 26 weeks or 52 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Sustained remission at 52 weeks occurred in 56 percent of the weekly TCZ group and in 53 percent of the every-other-week TCZ group, compared with 14 percent of the placebo group who tapered over 26 weeks and 18 percent of the placebo group who tapered over 52 weeks. The cumulative median prednisone dose over the 52-week period in each TCZ group was 1862 mg, as compared with 3296 mg in the placebo group on the 26-week taper and 3818 mg in the placebo group on the 52-week taper.

If vision is intact at the time appropriate glucocorticoid treatment is initiated, the risk of sight loss is reduced to less than 1 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1408267668\" class=\"local\">'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with GCA, we recommend initial treatment with systemic glucocorticoids to preserve vision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>) as well as to treat other clinical symptoms associated with GCA (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Treatment should be initiated promptly once the diagnosis is confirmed or there is a high index of suspicion for GCA. Our practice for initial dosing glucocorticoids is as follows (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initial dose'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without visual loss at presentation: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or equivalent, not to exceed 60 mg, given in a single daily dose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with threatened or established visual loss at presentation: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 500 to 1000 mg intravenous daily, for three days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms and signs of GCA usually respond quickly, permitting a taper of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> after two weeks and to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> after another two weeks. The dose can subsequently be reduced by 5 mg decrements every two weeks to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> at which point the speed of the glucocorticoid taper is slowed. It is axiomatic that glucocorticoid dosing be tailored to the individual patient's clinical course. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid tapering'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapses of disease activity are most common at <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> doses less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and are treated with increases in the glucocorticoid dose appropriate to the nature of the relapse. Relapses usually do not result in major adverse events such as visual loss. (See <a href=\"#H130373288\" class=\"local\">'Approach to dose reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring of disease activity requires careful clinical follow-up and regular tracking of the acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]). Minor fluctuations of the ESR and CRP are common during the course of the glucocorticoid taper and do not of themselves mandate increases in the glucocorticoid dose. Significant increases in the ESR and CRP warrant close clinical follow-up and consideration for a reduction in the speed of the taper. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring disease activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be regularly assessed for the presence of glucocorticoid-related side effects. Measures to maintain bone health should be implemented in all patients. Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> should be administered as indicated by current guidelines for management of atherosclerosis. Routine prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii </em>pneumonia (PCP) is not advised. (See <a href=\"#H446279165\" class=\"local\">'General measures in all patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid-sparing agents for the management of GCA include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> (TCZ) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX). Clinical settings where they may be of benefit include a relapsing clinical course, the development of glucocorticoid-related toxicities, or the presence of comorbid diseases, such as preexisting diabetes mellitus or osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"#H4159164883\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid-sparing agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment strategies for large vessel GCA are similar to those used for cranial GCA. (See <a href=\"#H63928623\" class=\"local\">'Large vessel GCA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of aortic aneurysm identified during the course of GCA is hampered by uncertainty as to the impact of treatment on progressive dilatation and dissection or rupture. Owing to this uncertainty, screening for aortic aneurysms is not routinely recommended but can be considered on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H3556721942\" class=\"local\">'Role of screening for large vessel disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom a clinical diagnosis of GCA is posited after negative workup are treated similar to those with proven GCA. (See <a href=\"#H1588648971\" class=\"local\">'Patients with negative biopsy and imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GCA is a disease of variable duration. Length of treatment may extend from one to multiple years. Glucocorticoid treatment can eventually be discontinued in the majority of patients. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Overall prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1582560035\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Gene G Hunder, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Crowson CS, Matteson EL, Myasoedova E, et al.
