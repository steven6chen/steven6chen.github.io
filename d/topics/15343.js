Extragonadal GCTs typically arise in midline locations, and specific sites vary with age. In adults, the most common sites are the anterior mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and the pineal and suprasellar regions. In infants and young children, sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs) are the most common GCTs.</p><p>SCTs are discussed here. Extragonadal GCTs arising in the central nervous system and in the mediastinum and retroperitoneum are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial germ cell tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extragonadal germ cell tumors involving the mediastinum and retroperitoneum&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCT is the most common GCT of childhood. In the pediatric population, SCTs account for 40 percent of all GCTs and up to 78 percent of all extragonadal GCTs. Rarely, sacrococcygeal teratomas may present in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>SCT is the most frequently recognized fetal neoplasm, with an estimated incidence of about 1 in 27,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. SCT are more common in females than males, with a 3 to 4:1 ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. SCTs with malignant elements generally are not seen in infants. The incidence of malignant elements within SCTs increases with age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Teratomas often are comprised of cells that represent all three germ cell layers. They have solid, cystic or mixed components. Unlike teratomas in other locations, SCTs often do not have a capsule or pseudocapsule, which contributes to the difficulty in achieving a complete resection.</p><p>GCTs can include mature, immature, and malignant tissues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mature teratomas &ndash; Mature teratomas consist of fully differentiated tissues from various somatic sites. These tissues may be small islands of cells mixed together, or they can include fully functional glandular structures such as pancreatic Langerhans cells or sebaceous glands. Fully developed bone, hair, and teeth have been found in mature teratomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immature teratomas &ndash; Immature teratomas include at least a small fraction of cells that are comprised of embryonal components or incompletely differentiated tissue structures. Primitive neuroectodermal features, such as primitive neural tubes and immature rosettes, are common. The Gonzalez-Crussi grading system has been used to describe the amount of immature tissue within the tumor: Grade 0: mature teratoma only; Grade 1: &lt;10 percent immature tissue; Grade 2: 10 to 50 percent immature tissue; and Grade 3: &gt;50 percent immature tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other grading systems have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant teratomas &ndash; SCTs that contain any malignant elements are considered malignant. Between 11 and 35 percent of SCTs are malignant, and many of these will have elevated tumor markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,11</a>]. The most common malignant element is a yolk sac component, which produces alpha fetoprotein (AFP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,12</a>]. Other malignant elements can include embryonal carcinoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET).</p><p/><p>Microfoci of malignant elements can be missed on pathologic sectioning. Therefore, screening with AFP and beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) is part of the initial evaluation of patients with SCT. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal detection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No consistent genetic changes have been identified in mature and immature teratomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, both gonadal and extragonadal GCTs of infancy frequently have gain of chromosomes 1q and 20q, as well as loss of chromosomes 1p and 6q. In contrast, postpubertal malignant GCTs are associated with the isochromosome 12p abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/6,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extragonadal germ cell tumors involving the mediastinum and retroperitoneum&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCT generally presents either in utero, as a mass extending off the caudal end of the fetus, or as a tumor of infancy that may be asymptomatic or present with signs of obstruction of the rectum or bladder. A small number of children present with weakness, pain, or paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The Altman Classification describes the extent to which a tumor is external <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> internal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81430\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81430 \">figure 1</a>). Type I tumors are primarily external, while type IV lesions are completely internal. Type I and II tumors are the most obvious on prenatal ultrasound and clinical exam. In the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (CCSG) experience with 37 SCTs, Altman types I, II, III, and IV were present in 62, 14, 19, and 6 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Type IV tumors typically are found later in infancy and early childhood, compared to tumors with an external component (types I, II, and III). Type IV SCTs can present with <span class=\"nowrap\">obstipation/constipation,</span> abdominal pain, or a palpable mass. Malignant elements are more frequent in type IV SCTs, with an incidence of 38 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>With the increasing use of prenatal ultrasound, many SCTs are now identified in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DETECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis typically occurs during the second trimester during routine sonography; first trimester diagnosis has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Most SCTs diagnosed in utero are Altman type I or II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5386466\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sonography usually demonstrates a mass near the distal spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88674\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88674 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88673\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88673 \">picture 2</a>). The majority of prenatally diagnosed SCTs are either solid or mixed cystic and solid; calcifications are often present. Associated structural abnormalities may include bladder outlet obstruction and hydronephrosis, rectal stenosis or atresia, and cardiomegaly secondary to vascular shunting and high output cardiac failure. (See <a href=\"#H24780332\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and monitoring'</a> below.) </p><p>Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended where available. Compared with sonography, MRI more accurately characterizes the intrapelvic and abdominal extent of the tumor and compression of adjacent organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88675\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88675 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. This information can help in prenatal counseling and preoperative planning for surgical resection. (See <a href=\"#H20606441\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal management'</a> below.)</p><p>The most important differential diagnosis of an exophytic cystic sacral mass in the fetus is a distal neural tube defect (myelomeningocele or myelocystocele) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26-28</a>]. A neural tube defect is diagnosed when the spinal elements are splayed posteriorly and there is a meningocele or meningomyelocele. Sacrococcygeal teratomas always have a portion in close proximity to the coccyx; they may impinge on the sacrum, but the mass effect is usually presacral rather than posterior, as a neural tube defect would be. Both entities can be associated with elevated maternal and amniotic alpha-fetoprotein levels. MRI can be helpful when the diagnosis is unclear by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24780332\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial ultrasound evaluation of the fetus, placenta, and tumor over the course of the gestation is an important component in the overall treatment plan. The major goal is to identify fetuses at increased risk of fetal demise because of hydrops (ie, abnormal fetal fluid collection), and intervene as appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonimmune hydrops fetalis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tumor size should be measured at each ultrasound examination, and solid portions of the tumor should be interrogated with Doppler ultrasound to assess vascular flow. Rapidly enlarging tumors and tumors that are solid, in particular, create a vascular steal phenomenon, which places the fetus at increased risk of developing hydropic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Large lesions (&gt;10 cm), especially vascular ones, are associated with a high perinatal mortality rate. Relatively cystic lesions with absent or mild vascularity tend to display slow growth and have a favorable outcome, even when large (&gt;10 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Amniotic fluid volume and placental thickness should also be evaluated, as polyhydramnios and placental thickening are markers for hydrops and oligohydramnios can result from bladder obstruction due to the SCT.</p><p>The frequency of ultrasound examinations depends on the composition of the tumor (ie, cystic or solid), its vascularity, and any associated findings; follow up imaging may be as often as twice per week for high-risk tumors, or as infrequently as every two weeks for small or predominantly cystic lesions. </p><p>Fetal echocardiography is recommended in fetuses with predominantly solid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular tumors. Echocardiography is used to identify a high output cardiac state, which precedes the onset of hydrops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A fetal cardiac profile consisting of assessment of the cardiothoracic ratio, cardiac dimension z scores, combined ventricular output, and valvular regurgitation can be used to identify fetuses with poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91044340\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging characteristics may provide prognostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/30,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34,35</a>]. For example, tumor volume to fetal weight ratio (TFR) &gt;0.12 on ultrasound before 24 weeks of gestation is a poor prognostic sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. In a single-center retrospective study, TFR &gt;0.12 on ultrasound before 24 weeks of gestation was associated with 4.7-fold increase in risk of poor prognosis (hydrops, perinatal death, need for fetal intervention), and a TFR &ge;0.11 before 32 weeks was associated with a 6.2-fold increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In another study, a solid tumor volume to head volume ratio &gt;1 was associated with a perinatal mortality rate of 61 percent due to high output failure and hydrops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review of 18 studies comprising 420 pregnancies complicated by SCT published in 2015 reported the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall survival was 73 percent (excluding pregnancy terminations)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival was poor with hydrops (15 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival was higher with tumors &lt;10 cm than &ge;10 cm (81 versus 72 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival was lower with solid versus <span class=\"nowrap\">cystic/mixed</span> type tumors (45 versus 73 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival was higher with mature SCTs versus immature SCTs (98 versus 69 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival by Altman type was: Type I (78 percent), Type II (70 percent), Type III (86 percent), Type IV (80 percent) &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifty-two percent of survivors were delivered at &lt;34 weeks of gestation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival was not affected by mode of delivery </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20606441\"><span class=\"h2\">Perinatal management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis and close monitoring have improved outcomes for fetal SCT, but overall perinatal mortality remains high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Estimates of perinatal mortality for prenatally diagnosed SCT range from 25 to 50 percent when cases of pregnancy termination, intrauterine death and neonatal death are included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,38</a>]. Potential perinatal complications include preterm labor, spontaneous tumor hemorrhage or rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], and maternal Mirror syndrome (maternal edema mirroring fetal edema). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonimmune hydrops fetalis&quot;, section on 'Mirror syndrome'</a>.). </p><p>In utero interventions are generally only temporizing measures to decrease the impact of the parasitic mass on the fetal cardiovascular system, allowing the fetus to recover in utero and continue to grow and mature. A definitive surgical procedure is typically required after the child&rsquo;s birth. For some high-risk SCT fetuses, in utero open fetal surgery is an option at specialized centers. Although criteria for open fetal surgery vary across centers, most include fetuses with high-risk SCT and hydrops developing at a gestational age earlier than appropriate for delivery and neonatal care (eg, 28 to 32 weeks gestation). Contraindications to open fetal surgery include type III or IV Altman type tumors, severe placentomegaly, cervical shortening, and maternal medical issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Minimally invasive in utero approaches for management of the hydropic fetus with SCT include laser ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], radiofrequency ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>], bladder drainage for obstructive uropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,44</a>], and cyst aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In a 2014 systematic review, overall perinatal survival with open fetal surgery was 50 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(6/12)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. For minimally invasive procedures, overall perinatal survival was 44 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(14/32);</span> 30 percent of hydropic fetuses survived <span class=\"nowrap\">(6/20)</span> and 67 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(8/12)</span> of fetuses without obvious hydrops survived. Mean gestational age at birth for the entire cohort was 30 weeks. Minimally invasive procedures resulting in tumor necrosis enabled performance of a lower-segment uterine incision rather than a classical incision during cesarean delivery.</p><p>In high-risk SCT fetuses that are not candidates for in utero intervention, the third trimester can be unpredictable, even with close monitoring. In selected high-risk SCT fetuses, early delivery and ex utero surgery may be an option, as advocated by investigators at the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment at Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. They suggest cesarean delivery, using an EXIT (ex utero intrapartum therapy) procedure when possible, for high risk SCT after 27 to 28 weeks. High-risk SCT are those with fetal high output cardiac failure, tumor hemorrhage, nonreassuring fetal testing (biophysical profile, fetal heart rate tracing, abnormal Dopplers), or impending preterm labor due to polyhydramnios <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tumor. In EXIT, the fetus is partially delivered and intubated without clamping the umbilical cord; uteroplacental blood flow and gas exchange are maintained by using inhalational agents to provide uterine relaxation and amnioinfusion to maintain uterine volume. This provides time for debulking the SCT prior to complete delivery of the infant, thereby interrupting the vascular steal that is the basis for high-output cardiac failure. </p><p>Fetuses with low-risk SCT are typically delivered by cesarean after 36 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Fetuses with small tumors (&lt;5 cm) can be delivered vaginally, but the majority of tumors are sufficiently large to necessitate cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20606448\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTNATAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If fetal MRI was not performed antenatally, CT or MRI of the primary site is commonly done after birth to assess the extent of internal tumor. Staging should include a CT of the chest and bone scan.</p><p>Serum levels of AFP and beta-hCG should be assessed at diagnosis to look for the presence of malignant components in the tumor. Because these tumors generally present at birth or early in infancy, interpretation of an elevated AFP can be difficult and must consider the age of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. AFP levels often decline slowly to reach normal levels in the very young, but a continued decline should be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530304869\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, surgical resection is undertaken postnatally. In utero interventions are generally only temporizing measures, allowing the fetus to recover in utero and continue to grow and mature; in selected cases at specialized centers, resection may be undertaken in utero. (See <a href=\"#H20606441\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal management'</a> above.)</p><p>Surgery for complete excision of an SCT often is quite extensive. It must include removal of the coccyx to be considered complete. Other considerations include early ligation of the sacral vessels and sterile circumferential preparation of the body due to the potential need for intraoperative change in approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. If a complete resection cannot be achieved in the first surgery, a second procedure may be required to complete the resection, particularly for tumors with malignant elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/10,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,51</a>].</p><p>Despite successful control of the tumor in the majority of patients, functional sequelae are common and can impair quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].

Bowel dysfunction (soiling, including total fecal incontinence in some cases) was reported in 13 percent and urinary incontinence was observed in 31 percent. In a more recent series of 45 patients treated from 2000 to 2013 in the United States, anorectal complications occurred in 29 percent and urologic complications occurred in 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

In a German series, recurrence was more frequent after incomplete resection (49 versus 11 percent, in those with complete resection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similarly, the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) observed a recurrence rate of 11 percent in patients with mature SCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of these, two recurrences were mature teratoma, while the remaining seven had yolk sac tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Both German and UK investigators found no benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with immature teratoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Similarly, the American Intergroup study demonstrated that observation after complete resection was an effective strategy in patients with immature teratoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant SCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with malignant SCT following surgery, platinum-based chemotherapy is a critical component of treatment. As in adults with advanced GCTs, the most widely used combinations are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (BEP) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> (BEJ). These regimens are effective therapy both at diagnosis for patients with malignant SCTs and for those who recur with malignant elements after resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-risk-stratified-treatment-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial risk-stratified treatment for advanced testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stage I and II malignant SCTs treated with complete surgical resection and chemotherapy have an overall survival (OS) at five years that exceeds 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/10,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,57,58</a>]. Metastatic tumors have a lower event-free survival (EFS) and OS. In a combined analysis of three German trials that utilized surgery followed by a five-drug chemotherapy regimen, outcomes were worse for those with metastatic tumors (five-year EFS 67 versus 83 percent in those without metastases, and OS 69 versus 92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>To facilitate surgical resection and to improve outcomes in patients with advanced disease with a malignant component, chemotherapy has been used to treat patients prior to an attempt at complete resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/12,51,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,51,57</a>]. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, those who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by resection had an EFS of 79 percent with an OS of 83 percent at five years, while those who had an immediate attempt at complete resection had both EFS and OS of 49 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The American Intergroup data showed similar results, with all non-thoracic, extragonadal GCTs having an EFS and OS of 82 and 87 percent, respectively, at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (CCSG) experience, patients with malignant sacrococcygeal GCT who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with BEJ had an EFS of 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Treatment for patients with completely resected (stage I) SCT with malignant components is controversial. These patients are generally eligible for studies that include chemotherapy; however, they have also been observed without chemotherapy in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,12</a>]. A case series and review of the literature identified 14 cases of stage I SCT with malignant components, 12 of whom survived with no recurrence at last follow-up, ranging from two to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Two patients who recurred were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and were alive at nine years.</p><p>The number of patients described in these studies is too small to make definitive recommendations regarding observation only for patients with malignant SCT. In the completed Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial, patients with a completely resected malignant SCT were considered to have intermediate risk disease and received at least three cycles of BEP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

SCTs are generally benign tumors. However, malignant elements can be present, and their frequency increases with the age of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As most SCTs are identified during pregnancy, serial ultrasound evaluation of the fetus, placenta, and tumor over the course of the gestation is an important component in the overall treatment plan. The major goal is to identify fetuses at increased risk of fetal demise because of hydrops (ie, abnormal fetal fluid collection), and intervene as appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H24780332\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, surgical resection is undertaken postnatally. In utero interventions are generally only temporizing measures, allowing the fetus to recover in utero and continue to grow and mature; in very selected cases at specialized centers, resection may be undertaken in utero. (See <a href=\"#H20606441\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H530304869\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For mature and immature SCTs, early, complete surgical resection is the cornerstone of management. There does not appear to be a role for adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Benign SCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with SCTs that contain malignant elements, maximal safe resection should be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in most cases. We suggest a platinum-based regimen such as BEP or BEJ, rather than alternative chemotherapeutic regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Malignant SCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential exceptions to this approach include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who undergo a complete resection for an SCT with malignant elements, observation, rather than adjuvant chemotherapy, may be an alternative, although there has been limited prospective evaluation of this approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with locally advanced or metastatic malignant SCTs, we suggest neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy (prior to attempted surgical resection), rather than adjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Audet IM, Goldhahn RT Jr, Dent TL.
