Palliative care is an interdisciplinary approach to care that focuses on improving quality of life for patients and families facing serious illness. Palliative care has a role across the stages of heart failure, starting early in the course of illness, intensifying in end-stage disease, and extending into caregiver bereavement. </p><p>Indications, estimation of prognosis, and strategies for palliative care in patients with advanced heart failure will be reviewed here. Advanced care planning, symptom management, and psychosocial support for patients with advanced heart failure and the general management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-decision-support-symptom-management-and-psychosocial-assistance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care for patients with advanced heart failure: Decision support, symptom management, and psychosocial assistance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1327169124\"><span class=\"h1\">OBJECTIVES, AND COMPONENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palliative care is an interdisciplinary approach to care that focuses on improving quality of life for patients and their families. Objectives of palliative care include relieving pain and other distressing symptoms, integration of medical, psychological and spiritual aspects of care, and offering a support system to help families cope during illness and bereavement. Greater integration of palliative care in the management of heart failure has the potential to facilitate coping with clinical uncertainty, to promote patient-centered care that bridges silos of care for coordinated management of comorbidities, to improve communication, and to assist shared decision making regarding use of life-saving devices with complex trade-offs. </p><p>Key components of palliative care include exploring patients&rsquo; understanding about their illness, discussing prognosis, clarifying goals of care, navigating treatment options, coordinating care, and helping to plan end-of-life care, including determining the need and timing of hospice care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1948274374\"><span class=\"h1\">PALLIATIVE CARE TYPES AND INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because heart failure is a highly symptomatic disease with complex decision making and a relatively high risk for death throughout its course, palliative care should be integrated early and often into the care of these patients. However, certain palliative care approaches may have greater applicability at different points in the disease and the overall intensity of palliative care needs tends to increase over time. Multiple practice guidelines and scientific statements recommend the use of palliative care in patients with heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. </p><p>Palliative care for patients with heart failure includes primary palliative care provided by non-palliative care specialists as well as secondary palliative care provided by palliative care specialists. The term &quot;hospice&quot; is used to describe a specific model of specialty palliative care that is offered to patients with a terminal disease who are at the end of life. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1542630766\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive, palliative-type services should be incorporated into the practices of all clinicians caring for patients with heart failure. Some term this &quot;primary&quot; palliative care to distinguish it from &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;subspecialty&quot; palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Just as the majority of heart failure care is provided by non-heart failure specialists, the majority of palliative care in heart failure must be provided by non-palliative care specialists. There are not enough palliative care specialists in practice to provide such services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and many of the palliative therapies that patients need are better integrated into existing care rather than fragmented into specialty silos. Primary palliative care includes the following: strategies for addressing dyspnea, pain, and fatigue; approaches to depression and anxiety; discussions around prognosis, goals of care, and shared decision making; and execution of advanced care directives. Clinicians caring for these patients need to attain competence in providing comprehensive supportive care. (See <a href=\"#H927012729\" class=\"local\">'Education and training'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3716673817\" class=\"local\">'Team-based palliative care'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1499934032\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary (specialty) palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While physicians caring for patients with heart failure are able to manage many palliative care needs, consultation with a palliative care specialist may be beneficial in certain situations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4185293646\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest referral for secondary palliative care for persistent New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV, patients with multiple comorbidities (eg, heart failure with renal failure, oxygen-dependent chronic lung disease, dementia, or metastatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]), progressive frailty, or when patient preferences shift the emphasis of care to quality of life. Formal guidelines for secondary palliative care referral have not been established. Criteria for a palliative care assessment at the time of admission to the hospital have been proposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76969 \">table 1</a>). (see <a href=\"#H1323782964\" class=\"local\">'Disease course and prognosis'</a> below). </p><p>Patients with heart failure in certain clinical settings may benefit from palliative care consultation. Specifically, patients considering left ventricular assist device (LVAD) are at high-risk of stroke, bleeding, infection, and other complications that contribute to an average survival after implantation of less than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In 2013, the United States Joint Commission mandated that all accredited destination therapy (DT) LVAD programs include a palliative care specialist as part of the team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In parallel, an update to the national coverage determination for bridge-to-transplant and DT-LVADs from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services required the interdisciplinary team to include a palliative care provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H503626524\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A growing body of evidence supports the inclusion of specialty palliative care into the management of patients diagnosed with a range of advanced diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], and palliative care needs in cardiovascular diseases are estimated to be the greatest of any disease. </p><p>However, what limited evidence is available on the impact of palliative care consultation services for patients with heart failure has been mixed: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 524 dying patients at five Veterans Affairs medical centers and affiliated nursing homes in 2006 to 2007 showed that those who received inpatient palliative care consultations had significantly better outcomes in five of six domains studied: information and communication, access to home care services, emotional and spiritual support, well-being and dignity, and care around the time of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large randomized trial showed that among families of patients with chronic critical illness, the use of at least two structured family meetings led by palliative care specialists and provision of an informational brochure (intervention) compared with provision of an informational brochure and routine family meetings conducted by intensive care unit teams (control) did not reduce anxiety or depression symptoms and may have increased posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p>These limited findings suggest that palliative care consultations likely need to be targeted to the right patients and be timely, inclusive of multiple components, and integrated into existing care in order to optimize benefit and minimize risk of harm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3716673817\"><span class=\"h2\">Team-based palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palliative care for heart failure generally requires an interdisciplinary approach,<strong> </strong>including primary care, cardiology, and palliative care specialists, each represented by various providers (eg, physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, case managers, pharmacists, and chaplains). While there is evidence suggesting that interdisciplinary care in heart failure can improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], integrating care across disciplines can be logistically challenging for providers and patients. A United Kingdom survey study found that just over half of palliative care physicians and nurses caring for heart failure patients reported some form of collaboration with cardiology providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Lack of clear roles in the partnership between cardiology and palliative care can contribute to silos of care. Not surprisingly, both patients and family members report confusion over which providers are directly involved in a patient&rsquo;s care. </p><p>Various specialties may take a more central role in coordination of patient care at different times in the disease span, often with transition of leadership from primary care to cardiology to palliative care. Shared ownership and collaboration around palliative care needs between primary care, cardiology, and palliative care can lead to improved communication and understanding of patients&rsquo; goals and better end-of-life experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a United Kingdom survey, more than 80 percent of palliative care providers thought that goals of care were not discussed with patients by their cardiology providers before being referred for palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One solution may be to appoint a member of the cardiology team to provide the link with palliative care. Several studies have reported effective collaborations involving a heart failure nurse or case manager who liaises between the two teams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2899765773\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospice is a specific model of specialty palliative care that is offered to patients with a terminal disease who are at the end of life when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer the focus of treatment. The availability of palliative care and hospice services varies among countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care and hospice outside of the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, hospice referral is largely determined by the Medicare hospice eligibility guidelines, which are divided into general and disease-specific types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Eligibility for hospice care typically requires that a physician estimate that life expectancy is six months or less, which can be problematic. (See <a href=\"#H1323782964\" class=\"local\">'Disease course and prognosis'</a> below.) The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services guidance notes that a patient will be considered to be in a terminal stage of heart disease (life expectancy of six months or less) if they meet the following criteria (criteria 1 and 2 are required; factors from criterion 3 will serve as supporting documentation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61282 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the time of initial certification or recertification for hospice, the patient has received optimum treatment for heart disease (ie, optimum treatment to the extent tolerated), the patient is not a candidate for surgical procedures, or the patient declines those procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with heart failure or angina have NYHA class IV functional status (eg, symptoms of heart failure or angina at rest and increased discomfort with any physical activity). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documentation of the following factors supports but is not required to establish eligibility for hospice care: treatment-resistant symptomatic supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias, history of cardiac arrest or resuscitation, history of unexplained syncope, brain embolism of cardiac origin, or concomitant HIV disease. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2119254808\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES IN PROVIDING PALLIATIVE CARE FOR HEART FAILURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1116638738\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence of underutilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the potential benefits of palliative care for people with heart failure, the application of palliative care to the heart failure patient population has been suboptimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. A survey study from the United Kingdom reported that 47 percent of palliative care providers received less than 10 referrals for heart failure patients annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3886893544\"><span class=\"h2\">Barriers to palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barriers to provision of palliative care in patients with heart failure include lack of evidence-based indications for palliative care, lack of provider and patient understanding about who can benefit from palliative care (eg, all patients with heart failure, not only those with terminal disease) and what palliative care can offer, uncertainty about patient prognosis, and limited provider education and training on how to discuss and implement palliative care. </p><p>A key cause of ineffective collaboration on palliative care is lack of knowledge. A qualitative survey study of 18 cardiology and primary care providers found that many did not know the differences between palliative care and hospice, including the eligibility criteria for these services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a multisite survey of 95 cardiology and primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, almost one-third reported a low or very low level of confidence in initiating prognosis or end-of-life discussions, enrolling patients in hospice, or providing end-of-life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. To help bridge this gap, there is a need for more education of providers and patients on the roles and functions of palliative care, which may promote greater general acceptance of palliative care.

Most contemporary data from developed nations indicate that the prevalence of symptomatic heart failure is increasing (in the United States, from 5.8 million in 2010 to more than 8 million by 2030) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] despite a plateau in its incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], suggesting that patients are living longer with symptomatic disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3379339235\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predicting future events and anticipating the transition to end-stage disease is important for planning and shared decision making. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-of-prognosis-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication of prognosis in palliative care&quot;</a>.) For example, hospice eligibility relies on a physician&rsquo;s certification &quot;that the patient&rsquo;s life expectancy is six months or less&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Given the difficulty of predicting life expectancy, regulators have provided specific guidance based upon clinical criteria to satisfy the life expectancy requirement for hospice in various clinical settings, but these may not mirror individual patient outcomes.

Nearly 10 percent of patients are dead within a month of a hospitalization, and yet some patients will live for decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comorbidity</strong>: The frequent co-occurrence of heart failure with advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and frailty impacts the variability of its course.

Multiple comorbidities amplify symptoms, complicate management, alter prognosis, and contribute to polypharmacy.

Patients with heart failure may have dramatic worsening and then impressive recovery with medical therapy or surgical interventions.

For patients discharged from the hospital with advanced heart failure, both physicians and nurses had modest ability to discriminate those who subsequently died from those who lived (with nurses outperforming physicians), with absolute estimates generally over-estimating survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In patients with chronic heart failure, patient self-predictions also tended to overestimate survival versus model-based predictions and actual survival, particularly for younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

For example, if a patient died 12 months from the time a model was used to estimate survival time, the model would have predicted median survival of &gt;24 months or &lt;6 months more than half the time. It is therefore vital to acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty in discussions about future care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, a study of 10,930 ambulatory patients with heart failure examined differences between population-based and individual estimates of risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the year after study enrollment, 1661 patients died (15.9 percent by life-table analysis).

The SHFM predicted a greater than 50 percent probability of dying in the next year for 8 of the 1661 patients who died (sensitivity for one-year death was 0.5 percent) and for five patients who lived at least a year (positive predictive value, 61.5 percent). Similarly, the MAGGIC risk calculator predicted a more than 50 percent probability of dying in the next year for 52 of the 1661 patients who died (sensitivity, 3.1 percent) and for 63 patients who lived at least a year (positive predictive value, 45.2 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Conversely, the SHFM estimated that 8496 patients (77.8 percent) had a less than 15 percent probability of dying at one year, yet nearly two-thirds of the deaths occurred among patients in this lower-risk score range (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;997). Similarly, the MAGGIC risk calculator estimated a probability of dying of less than 25 percent for the majority of patients who died at one year (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;914).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple relevant outcomes</strong>: Most prognostic models in heart failure focus on the singular outcome of mortality. However, other clinical outcomes (symptoms, limited functional capacity, loss of independence, reduced social functioning, decreased quality of life, and increased caregiver commitment) also rank high in importance to individual patients, particularly in advanced disease. Multiple studies have documented some patients&rsquo; willingness to sacrifice survival in exchange for symptom relief, a trade-off that varies between patients and within the same patient over time. Unfortunately, much less is known about risk prediction for nonsurvival outcomes. Even less is known about the relative impact of disease and therapies on caregiver burden and quality of life for family members.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H921993696\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGIES FOR PROVISION OF PALLIATIVE CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H927012729\"><span class=\"h2\">Education and training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians require education and training to understand and implement the roles and functions of palliative care.

Specialty certifications are also available for nurses, social workers, and chaplains. Master&rsquo;s degree programs have also been developed for physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurses who are interested in becoming community palliative care specialists. In most jurisdictions, specialty palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team who work with a patient&rsquo;s other clinicians to provide an &quot;extra layer&quot; of support. The availability of subspecialty palliative care services is variable and in overall shortage, such that provision of primary palliative care services by non-palliative care providers will always be an essential part of heart failure care.

Communication with patients and their families about their preferences for care and the potential life-limiting nature of heart failure early in the course of illness may facilitate later conversations when the patients&rsquo; disease status worsens. End-of-life discussions are inherently sensitive, often time consuming, and require navigating the complex needs of patients and families. Yet, when done well, such discussions can significantly improve quality of life for both patients and caregivers and improve the quality of medical care and palliation.

A shared decision making model involves a bidirectional exchange of information between clinicians and patients enabling collaborative deliberation in choosing the best courses of action; information about prognosis is a key component of this discussion.

Shared decision making recognizes that there are often complex trade-offs when taking medical decisions and it fulfills the ethical and legal mandate to fully inform patients of all risks and benefits of a treatment. This is particularly true in heart failure, where several medical decisions (eg, choosing whether or not to proceed with destination therapy LVAD or with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation in a frail older patient) are preference-sensitive, owing to their high-risk, high-reward nature, as well as their impact on the mode of death.
