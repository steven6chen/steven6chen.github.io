Emergency rescue devices may be lifesaving in children with difficult airways in whom conventional endotracheal intubation has failed. They should be available for any child undergoing emergent endotracheal intubation. This topic discusses the indications, contraindications, and techniques for use of such devices in children.</p><p>The following pediatric topics on the difficult airway are presented elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of the difficult airway (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices to facilitate endotracheal intubation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needle cricothyroidotomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Needle cricothyroidotomy with percutaneous transtracheal ventilation&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wire-guided cricothyroidotomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;, section on 'Seldinger technique'</a>)</p><p/><p>The general principles of pediatric airway management and rapid sequence intubation are discussed separately.

Those devices that are placed above the glottis without extension of any components into the esophagus are also called supraglottic airway devices. Thus, a laryngeal mask airway is a type of supraglottic airway while a Combitube is an extraglottic airway that is <strong>not</strong> supraglottic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4071519\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR THE FAILED AIRWAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A contingency plan in the event of a failed endotracheal intubation should be developed for all patients, ideally before rapid sequence intubation is necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73112 \">algorithm 1</a>). Clinicians should have rescue devices available whenever performing an emergent pediatric intubation. Rescue devices permit oxygenation and ventilation in situations where endotracheal intubation cannot be performed in a timely manner and can also facilitate endotracheal intubation in patients with difficult airways. </p><p>There is no one accepted definition of a &quot;failed&quot; airway. But many authorities suggest that if an operator cannot place a definitive airway in three attempts after changing blade type and length once each, then he or she should consider the attempt failed and change to a different technique or allow a different operator to try. Others have stated that any time the patient's oxygen saturation falls below 90 percent during an intubation attempt, an alternative technique is indicated. In either case, multiple unsuccessful attempts to secure an airway indicate that a different operator or technique should be employed. Rescue devices can prevent hypoxia and hypercarbia and serve as a bridge until definitive securing of the airway is accomplished. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;, section on 'Identification of the difficult pediatric airway'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4071755\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF DEVICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was first used in 1988, numerous similar devices have been developed. Some investigators describe the original devices, like the LMA Classic as &ldquo;First Generation&rdquo; supraglottic devices and later devices, with additional features as &ldquo;Second and Third Generation&rdquo; devices. Regardless of the &ldquo;generation&rdquo; to which the device belongs, these supraglottic devices all share a similar functional principle; if the peripharyngeal area can be occluded with a mask or balloon and the laryngeal opening can be isolated from the esophagus, the relatively lower resistance of the distal airway will allow for ventilation without direct tracheal intubation. Because blind insertion of a supraglottic airway is likely to be much easier than tracheal intubation, these devices represent a true advance in airway management. The utility of these devices is highlighted by an operating room study that included 109 patients with a predicted difficult airway. The authors were able to successfully manage 105 of them (96 percent) using a supraglottic device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The laryngeal mask airway and similar laryngeal tracheal devices (eg, King LAD, air-Q, i-gel, Ambu Aura, or CobraPLA) are the most versatile airway rescue devices for children and are available in sizes that permit placement in all pediatric patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67558\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67558 \">table 1</a>). Other rescue devices are available, but with pediatric size limitations. The Combitube is an effective alternative but cannot be used in children under 4 feet in height. Laryngotracheal airways come in sizes that allow for use in younger children (lower limit of height or weight: 35 inches or 12 kg). </p><p>There is some evidence to suggest that one supraglottic device, the LMA Supreme (size 1) might be superior to BVM ventilation in neonatal resuscitation, making it a potential rescue airway for neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22258742\"><span class=\"h2\">Training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rescue airway devices are likely to be used by the emergency care provider when standard airway management techniques have failed and tensions are high. The patient&rsquo;s life may well depend upon the clinician&rsquo;s ability to secure an alternative airway, and the clinician will be under considerable stress. These are not the circumstances under which to use an unfamiliar device for the first time. Thus, emergency physicians and others who might need to use a rescue airway device should learn to use it well in advance of need. Training can be accomplished in a simulation center, a cadaver lab, or an operating room, depending upon the type of device and the availability of mentors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Additionally, several organizations offer training in difficult airway management for emergency practitioners. Studies suggest that successful placement of laryngeal mask airways in the first attempt after formal training is as high as 90 to 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8354652\"><span class=\"h1\">LARYNGEAL MASK AIRWAY (LMA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The LMA is widely used in children. It comes in sizes that permit placement in all pediatric patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67558\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67558 \">table 1</a>). The Classic LMA is a scaled down version of the adult LMA while the pediatric ProSeal LMA has specific design features that may permit a better seal and greater protection against aspiration and gastric inflation, especially in infants and young children, including a gastric channel which permits passage of a nasogastric tube and gastric decompression while the LMA is in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The LMA Supreme is a single use device that is similar to the ProSeal. It is available in sizes appropriate for use in infants and children. In anesthesia studies in children, LMAs can be successfully inserted on the first attempt 80 to 100 percent of the time, depending on the technique (rotational, lateral, or standard placement) and specific device (Classic LMA or ProSeal LMA) used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8354660\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The LMA may be effective in situations in which tracheal intubation is difficult or impossible, and when placed correctly can avoid the need for continuous mask seal during bag-mask ventilation. It can also be attempted in the &ldquo;cannot intubate-cannot ventilate&rdquo; situation, but care must be taken to insure that the patient does not experience an excessively long period of hypoxemia. The LMA can serve as a bridge between bag mask ventilation and intubation and can facilitate the use of devices for difficult endotracheal intubation (eg, fiberoptic stylet, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].

It should not be used when the airway anatomy is significantly distorted (eg, laryngeal trauma, congenital anomalies of the larynx) or in patients with upper airway infection that distorts anatomy (eg, epiglottitis). However, in one operating room study, the LMA had a failure rate of less than one percent. In most cases, failure was related to airway obstruction or to coughing or &ldquo;bucking&rdquo; in an inadequately sedated patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The degree to which this information is applicable to the emergency department setting is unclear.</p><p>The LMA provides less protection against aspiration than endotracheal intubation, but in situations requiring the insertion of a rescue airway, the risk of aspiration is generally outweighed by the benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4071908\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three techniques available for LMA placement: standard, rotational, and lateral. The standard technique is appropriate for children over seven years of age (see <a href=\"#H8354674\" class=\"local\">'Standard technique'</a> below). We recommend that clinicians use the rotational technique instead of the lateral or standard technique when placing LMAs in children under seven years of age (see <a href=\"#H4072085\" class=\"local\">'Rotational technique'</a> below). This recommendation is based upon the following evidence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cross-over trial of 78 children between three months and 10 years of age undergoing elective eye surgery, the rotational technique was associated with a significantly higher success rate (96 versus 81 percent first pass success rate), lower time to successful insertion (12 versus 16 seconds) than the standard technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

It may be used in children weighing 30 kg or greater. Rather than a flexible ventilating tube, the ILMA has a &quot;U&quot; shaped metal tube designed to accommodate a specially adapted, flexible, endotracheal tube. Within the mask is a lever which is intended to lift the epiglottis as the tip of the endotracheal tube passes through the mask. A special handle is attached to the side of the tube. This is intended to facilitate placement. Finally, the kit contains a rubber stabilizing bar which is used during tracheal intubation through the ILMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

However, the primary difficulties associated with the CPLA are either not inserting the device far enough such that the ventilating surface does not cover the glottis or advancing it too far. In the former case, the tongue might be pushed out of the mouth, indicating the need to advance the CPLA further. In the latter case, ventilation will not be possible, and as in all such cases, the device should be removed and replaced. Additionally, the CPLA does not prevent aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and like all such devices, is like to be ineffective in patients who have significant distal airway resistance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17195961\"><span class=\"h1\">COMBITUBE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Combitube is a double-lumen supraglottic tube that was designed as a true &quot;rescue&quot; airway. It comes in only two sizes. Selection of the correct size is based upon the patient&rsquo;s height (in feet). The large adult size is intended for use in patients who are 5 feet tall and taller, and the small adult version is meant for use in patients 4 to 5.5 feet tall. Therefore, this device cannot be used in young children. </p><p>The Combitube has two balloon cuffs: the larger size Combitube has a proximal cuff that accepts 100 cc of air and a distal cuff that accepts 15 cc. The smaller size Combitube has a proximal cuff that accepts 85 cc of air, and a distal cuff with a volume of 12 cc. If the device is inadvertently placed in the trachea rather than the esophagus, ventilation can be accomplished through the esophageal port. The Combitube is especially useful in appropriately sized patients without airway obstruction whose airways cannot be visualized. It should be noted that the Combitube does have latex components and, therefore, should not be used in latex-sensitive individuals if alternative devices are available. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17196023\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Combitube is indicated in appropriately sized patients with respiratory failure when standard laryngoscopy has failed or is unavailable (eg, a clinic, office, or hospital setting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although some experts might attempt to use the Combitube as a &quot;bridge&quot; to intubation, this should be considered an advanced technique and should only be attempted by experienced operators.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17196030\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Combitube is unlikely to be effective in cases of airway obstruction (eg, croup, asthma) because the pressure in the airway will be higher than the sealing pressure of its balloons, allowing air to leak around them. It should not be used when the airway anatomy is significantly distorted. The Combitube does not provide complete protection against aspiration but in situations requiring the insertion of a rescue airway, the small risk of aspiration is generally outweighed by the benefits. The Combitube contains latex and, therefore, should be used with caution in latex-sensitive individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17196037\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Summon additional airway experts (eg, anesthesiologist, otolaryngologist, emergency medicine, or critical care subspecialist), if needed and if available, while establishing a rescue airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the Combitube from its packaging, inspect the balloons for damage, and lubricate the tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the Combitube into the oral cavity and advance it down the midline.

In most cases the Combitube has entered the esophagus. Because the distal balloon occludes the esophagus and the proximal balloon occludes the oral cavity, air exiting through fenestrations in the portion of the tube served by the blue port preferentially enters the trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73193\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73193 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If ventilation via the blue port is ineffective, then the Combitube may have been inserted into the trachea.

If the Combitube can be repositioned quickly, then ventilation can be attempted again. However, you must be cognizant of the time elapsed during ventilation attempts. It might be best to remove the tube, ventilate with a mask, and reinsert the Combitube or an alternative device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If ventilation is successful through either port, secure the Combitube.

Many function (and look) similar to the LMA while others function more like the Combitube. Unlike the Combitube, these devices often have a sealed distal balloon and must, therefore, be placed into the esophagus. They have two advantages over the Combitube. They are softer and therefore less likely to damage the esophagus, and they are available in multiple sizes so that they can be used in smaller children. For example the King LTD Supraglottic Airway, size 2 can be used in patients as small as 12 kg or 35 inches in height. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17196113\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These devices have the same indications and <span class=\"nowrap\">contraindications/cautions</span> as the other supraglottic rescue airways described except that, unlike the Combitube, most do not contain latex.

Clinicians should have rescue devices available whenever performing an emergent pediatric intubation. Rescue devices permit oxygenation and ventilation in situations where endotracheal intubation cannot be performed in a timely manner and can also facilitate endotracheal intubation in patients with difficult airways.
