Approximately 150,000 coccidioidal infections occur each year resulting in an estimated 50,000 illnesses; of these only a few experience progressive pneumonia or spread of the infection to other parts of the body. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pulmonary sequelae and complications of coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations and treatment of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For some of those infected, no apparent underlying medical condition appears to account for the development of complications. However, altered host immunity by identifiable predisposing diseases or drug therapies increasingly seems to be responsible for complications. Since the etiologies of immunosuppression are numerous and their effects vary in scope and depth, the exact effect of a specific immunosuppressive condition upon the course of a coccidioidal infection is not always predictable.</p><p>Some of the most well-known factors that have been associated with disseminated infection and emerging strategies for reducing their risk will be reviewed here. This has been an evolving field, and as more experience is obtained with coccidioidomycosis in immunocompromised patients, it is likely that recommendations will continue to change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT ON DISEASE EXPRESSION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased disease severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunosuppression affects the clinical severity of coccidioidomycosis primarily by increasing the risk of extrapulmonary dissemination. This observation was first suggested in case reports but later was established by measuring the incidence of dissemination within defined populations of susceptible hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In renal transplant recipients, for example, three-quarters of diagnosed infections resulted in extrapulmonary lesions, perhaps 50- to 200-fold higher than in contemporaneous normal populations. In patients with rheumatologic diseases, the increased use of immunosuppressive regimens, including anti-TNF therapies, also carries the risk of more extensive coccidioidal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The finding of a diffuse reticulonodular pneumonia, the result of hematogenous seeding of the lungs associated with fungemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], is also most common in immunosuppressed patients. As an example, in a series of 300 patients hospitalized for coccidioidal pneumonia, diffuse pneumonia was identified in 13, and of these 13, all but 3 had an underlying immunocompromising condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pulmonary sequelae and complications of coccidioidomycosis&quot;, section on 'Diffuse reticulonodular pneumonia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sites of infection and histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disseminated coccidioidal lesions tend to occur in the same locations regardless of the immune status of the host (eg, in or under the skin, in the skeletal system, or in the meninges) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75408\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75408 \">image 1</a>). However, in addition to these sites, patients with profound immunosuppression are more likely to experience other lesions including in the inguinal lymph nodes, the liver, and subserosally in the intestines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Granulomatous responses by histology are also less formed in the lesions of the most immunosuppressed patients and contain a greater number of organisms than in immunocompetent or less immunosuppressed hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactivation of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition, immunosuppression can reactivate previously acquired latent coccidioidal infection. Although normal immunologic control results in resolution of illness, it appears to do so without eradicating the Coccidioides from the body. As an example, stable asymptomatic solitary pulmonary nodules can yield viable Coccidioides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This suggests that infections might be controlled by inducing dormancy rather than by killing the organism. Since growth occurs when Coccidioides is removed from tissue, the dormant state appears to be a dynamic immunologic process.</p><p>Numerous case reports have identified instances of infection becoming overt in patients after long periods of time away from endemic regions for coccidioidomycosis. One patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), for example, developed active coccidioidal disease for the first time in Spain, approximately 12 years after leaving the southwestern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. From 1987 to 1992, 46 percent of all coccidioidal infections in patients with AIDS in the United States were diagnosed in residents of non-endemic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The risk of reactivation appears to depend upon the level of immunosuppression. One group of investigators found that severity of the infection and death was correlated with the extent of the underlying Hodgkin lymphoma in patients with this cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, in patients within the endemic regions undergoing renal replacement therapy, only 2 to 3 percent annually developed active disease, a proportion much smaller than that presumed to have been infected prior to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Recent infection rates within the endemic area appear even smaller than before [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], possibly due in part by more targeted anti-rejection drug regimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSED PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ongoing debate about the need for treatment of the primary infection in otherwise healthy patients does not generally apply to immunosuppressed hosts (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;</a>). Patients with any of the immunosuppressive conditions discussed below, who develop any evidence of an active coccidioidal infection, warrant treatment because the likelihood of complications is so high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>The selection of drugs to treat coccidioidomycosis does not differ for immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, since many immunosuppressed patients are receiving other drugs that may have significant interactions with triazole antifungals, especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, a review of all the patient's medications should be conducted prior to initiating antifungal therapy. Appropriate dose modifications should be instituted if a triazole drug is chosen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Drug interactions'</a>.)</p><p>While the choice of drug is similar in immunocompromised patients, the duration of therapy for coccidioidomycosis is not the same. Treatment should probably be continued indefinitely in patients with ongoing immunosuppression compared to courses of therapy up to 12 months in other patients with careful observation for relapse after cessation of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations and treatment of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with HIV/AIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the development of combination antiretroviral therapy, coccidioidomycosis was recognized as a major opportunistic infection (OI) for those human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals who had lived or were living within the coccidioidal endemic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. While it is clear that coccidioidomycosis among HIV-infected patients can be due to reactivation of previously acquired infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], most cases identified within the coccidioidal endemic area appear to be due to recent acquisition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cellular immune function, reflected through the peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte count, is the most important factor in determining whether a patient with HIV infection will develop symptomatic coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A prospective study performed in the era before the advent of potent combination antiretroviral therapy demonstrated that approximately 25 percent of a cohort living in an endemic region developed symptomatic coccidioidomycosis. The main risk factor was a CD4 count &lt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or a clinical diagnosis of AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Because immunosuppression is the leading risk factor for the development of symptomatic coccidioidomycosis among HIV-infected patients, the use of potent combination antiretroviral therapy, which results in immune restoration and increased CD4 cell counts, appears to have decreased the incidence of symptomatic coccidioidomycosis in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several patterns of disease have been described in HIV-infected patients. In one case-controlled study, increased severity of disease was associated with low CD4 cell counts and uncontrolled viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A diffuse pulmonary process is most commonly seen in the setting of advanced immunosuppression and is associated with a high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/6,7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,21</a>]. This diffuse bilateral reticulonodular pattern may be indistinguishable from <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (<em>carinii</em>) pneumonia and may occur concomitantly with it. Associated symptoms can include dyspnea, fever and night sweats.</p><p>In less immunocompromised patients, coccidioidomycosis presents similarly as in immunocompetent hosts. The most common presentation is focal pneumonia with cough, fever, and a localized infiltrate. Suspicion of coccidioidal pneumonia may arise if the patient has been in an endemic area, has hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, peripheral eosinophilia, night sweats and fatigue, and no clinical response to treatment for community acquired pneumonia.</p><p>Disseminated forms of coccidioidomycosis are common in the setting of HIV infection and include meningitis and lymph node and skin involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, bone and joint involvement appears to be distinctly less common among those with HIV infection.</p><p>HIV-infected patients may also present with fever and weight loss without any clear organ involvement in association with a positive coccidioidal serology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis is established through serologic testing, histopathological identification, and culture as it is in the noncompromised host.

As an example, one-third of HIV-infected patients with diffuse reticulonodular pulmonary infiltrates were seronegative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Diagnosis may require identification of the fungus in respiratory secretions or other involved sites; culture results are frequently available in less than five days. Occasionally, fungus will be isolated from blood cultures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to treat, and which antifungal agents to use, depends upon the patient&rsquo;s degree of immunosuppression and the severity of their symptoms (focal versus disseminated). A discussion on when to discontinue therapy is found below.

Fluconazole is preferred because itraconazole has more drug interactions and gastrointestinal absorption may be limited in the HIV-infected patient. A higher dose of fluconazole can be considered if there is no initial response within 6 weeks. Treatment should be continued for at least six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The remaining seven either did not receive post-operative fluconazole or were not adherent to treatment; of these patients, two had reactivation of their infection with coccidioidomycosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recipients who live in an endemic area with a negative serology &ndash; </strong>The management of patients who live in endemic areas, but have a negative serology has not been established. One transplantation center within a coccidioidal endemic region found that of 391 liver transplant recipients, 12 without prior evidence of coccidioidal infection developed coccidioidomycosis, 8 of which occurred within the first year following organ engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Based upon this experience, they suggest the use of antifungal prophylaxis for 6 to 12 months after any organ transplantation in all patients who live in endemic areas. This strategy was evaluated in a retrospective review of 143 patients living in a coccidioidal endemic region receiving liver transplantations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Among those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> for one year, no cases of coccidioidomycosis developed within the first year following transplant, compared with 10 cases in 391 patients (2.6 percent) who received targeted prophylaxis based upon pretransplant history of coccidioidomycosis or asymptomatic seropositivity. However, this proposed strategy has not been further validated, and the potential benefits have not been analyzed in comparison with the risk of drug interactions and the lack of long-term efficacy data. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recipients who receive an organ from a donor with evidence of coccidioidomycosis </strong>&ndash; There have been several reports of coccidioidomycosis transmission from a donor after allogeneic solid organ transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/14,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,35</a>]. Until more information becomes available, we believe it is reasonable to treat such patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> 400 mg per day for at least a year and possibly for life.</p><p/><p>Sometimes, a patient will present with active infection at the time of organ engraftment. If possible, we defer surgery until there is evidence that the clinical infection has resolved (as assessed by serology and chest radiograph findings). However, if this is not possible, we treat the initial infection with azole therapy alone for mild disease or amphotericin plus an azole for diffuse pulmonary or disseminated disease (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above). After completing treatment, we administer prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> 400 mg daily for on one year and then reduce the dose to 200 mg. We continue fluconazole for as long as the patient is on immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic malignancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hematologic malignancies are at risk for serious coccidioidal infections. It is unclear to what extent this is due to the underlying malignancy or to the chemotherapy used to treat the cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, severe illness may develop even in patients who are in remission and who have completed radiation and chemotherapy.</p><p>A retrospective review identified 55 patients with coccidioidomycosis and underlying hematologic malignancy in a major medical center in Arizona [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Pulmonary involvement was present in 95 percent of patients. Of the 16 patients who died in follow-up, 15 had active infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195642306\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematopoietic cell transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Very few patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation have developed coccidioidomycosis. One report described three cases from three institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Another report suggests good outcome even in a patient with active disease at the time of transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A review of 121 consecutive patients from a single center within the endemic region identified three cases, one of whom died of disseminated coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One review of coccidioidomycosis patients with potentially immunocompromising conditions noted that a major unifying factor was the systemic administration of glucocorticoid steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, the exact risk has not been clearly defined. Of the many patients who chronically receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in doses of 5 to 15 mg per day for the management of chronic obstructive lung disease, very few develop disseminated coccidioidal infections. However, it is presumed that the risk is increased in patients receiving chronic therapy with higher doses.</p><p>Other drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> for the management of rheumatologic diseases, even in the absence of corticosteroids, have been associated with disseminated coccidioidomycosis. There have also been case reports of disseminated coccidioidomycosis in patients receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapies. In one report, thirteen cases of acute coccidioidomycosis were identified in patients living in a coccidioidal endemic region who received TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> in combination with methotrexate was associated with a five-fold increase in risk. The risk associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, a TNF-alpha receptor agonist, was much lower. Another report described the experience of identifying and managing coccidioidal infections in patients receiving treatment with biologic response modifiers. The general impression was that early detection of coccidioidal infection and the use of oral antifungals such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> reduces complications considerably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. An additional discussion of TNF-alpha inhibitors and fungal infections is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections&quot;, section on 'Coccidioidomycosis'</a>.)</p><p>Based upon these observations, obtaining a history of prior symptomatic coccidioidomycosis and a coccidioidal serology prior to initiating such therapy is prudent. Many experts would initiate triazole therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>) at a daily dose of 400 mg in patients with positive coccidioidal serologic tests prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha therapy and continuing antifungal agents as long as the patient remained on such treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-an-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: An overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women who present with clinical signs and symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are at risk for developing severe disease. Several reports have shown that women first diagnosed with coccidioidomycosis during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester or the peripartum period, were likely to follow a severe course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. However, not all pregnant women who develop coccidioidomycosis are at risk for dissemination. Epidemiologic studies suggest that many pregnant patients with coccidioidomycosis have sufficiently mild infection to go undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].</p><p>We consider antifungal therapy for all pregnant women with evidence of active infection given their risk for developing disseminated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This includes women who have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A new positive serology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serologic titer that is increasing in someone who had previously treated disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical signs and symptoms of disease </p><p/><p>We do not treat women with a history of coccidioidomycosis who do not have active disease. Instead, we screen these women with serial coccidioidal serology ever 6-12 weeks to assess for reactivation of their disease.</p><p>The recommended drug for coccidiomycosis during pregnancy is amphotericin B. Therapy with an azole antifungal is contraindicated during the first trimester because of the risk of teratogenicity. In addition, one study found an increased risk of spontaneous abortion in woman receiving oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The management of such patients with coccidioidal meningitis in the first trimester involves intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a>.). </p><p>Triazole therapy for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis may be considered after the first trimester. The rationale for and against the use if azole therapy is described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some clinicians administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> after the first trimester since the teratogenic effects of azoles seem to occur early in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The use of triazoles after the first trimester is most appropriate for pregnant women who have meningitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who have adverse reactions to amphotericin (eg, nephrotoxicity, allergy). However, there are limited data evaluating the safety of this agent in the second and third trimester. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative approach is to continue amphotericin throughout the pregnancy (intrathecal therapy in the case of meningitis). Amphotericin is considered a category B agent for use in pregnancy and there is extensive clinical experience with this antifungal medication in pregnant women. The known safety for the fetus must be weighed against the efficacy of amphotericin (especially in the case of meningitis) as well as the risk of nephrotoxicity and the need for intravenous administration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of amphotericin B&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4191770724\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific gene mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several patients have been identified with specific gene mutations that have been associated with disseminated coccidioidomycosis. These include &gamma;-interferon receptor (IFN-&gamma;R1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], IL-12 receptor (IL-12R&beta;1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], STAT1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], and STAT3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. All of these cases had unusual features. As an example, the patient with the IFN-&gamma;R1 mutation also had two atypical mycobacterial infections at other times in his life. The IL-12R&beta;1 mutations were autosomal dominant and were present in siblings from a consanguineous family. The patients with the STAT1 mutation had dissemination and progressive pulmonary involvement with a striking absence of the pulmonary cavitation that is typical in chronic coccidioidal lung infections. Finally, the STAT3 patients also exhibited Job&rsquo;s Syndrome (hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome). These differences in clinical presentation suggest that the genetic factors that result in disseminated infections that are usually encountered may be more subtle polymorphisms than the mutations thus far identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDITIONS WITHOUT PROVEN RISK OF DISSEMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although experimental studies have raised the possibility of immunologic deficiencies associated with diabetes mellitus, there is little evidence that diabetic patients per se are predisposed to disseminated coccidioidomycosis. There has been a long-held belief that adult diabetics are predisposed to fibrocavitary complications and this has been corroborated by a report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;</a>). This study also suggested that patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia (greater than 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> had a two- to threefold increased risk of dissemination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Humoral deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experimental evidence suggests that humoral immunity is not protective against <em>Coccidioides&nbsp;immitis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Consistent with this finding, patients with hypogammaglobulinemia from whatever cause have not been found to have unusually severe coccidioidal infections. Complement may be involved in chemotaxis of neutrophils or other leukocytes to areas of coccidioidal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], and in patients with primary coccidioidomycosis, serum concentrations of complement components were found to be low during early coccidioidal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

However, in the immunocompromised host, coccidioidomycosis can lead to severe pneumonia and disseminated disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated coccidioidomycosis is most commonly characterized by skin, bone, and joint lesions and meningeal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Sites of infection and histology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunocompromised patients can develop primary coccidioidomycosis through inhalation, or previously dormant sites of infection can reactivate. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Reactivation of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to the development of combination antiretroviral therapy, coccidioidomycosis was recognized as a major opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients living in endemic areas. The incidence of coccidioidomycosis has declined with the era of potent antiretroviral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patients with HIV/AIDS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of coccidioidomycosis will depend on the level of immunosuppression. In HIV-infected patients with relatively preserved CD4 cell counts, a focal pneumonia may be seen, while patients with advanced immunosuppression may have diffuse pulmonary involvement with meningitis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other risk groups for severe coccidioidomycosis include transplant recipients and patients who have been treated with cancer chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, or glucocorticoids.
