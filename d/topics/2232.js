Doctors recommend that, when possible, women feed their babies only breast milk until the baby is 6 months old. Breast milk has all of the nutrition that babies need until they are 6 months old. Breastfeeding can also help prevent babies from getting ear infections, lung infections, or diarrhea. If possible, women should continue breastfeeding until the baby is at least 1 year old, even after he or she starts eating solid foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147817\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I start breastfeeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women can start breastfeeding in the delivery room. Women should start breastfeeding within the first few hours of giving birth. For the first few days, most women make only a small amount of yellowish milk called &quot;colostrum.&quot; Colostrum has all of the nutrition a newborn needs. Most women start making more milk after 2 or 3 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147824\"><span class=\"h1\">How should I hold my baby during breastfeeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are different ways you can hold your baby during breastfeeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60405\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60405 \">figure 1</a>). You can try different positions to figure out which way works best for you and your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147831\"><span class=\"h1\">What does &quot;latch-on&quot; mean?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Latch-on is another word for when a baby makes a tight seal with his or her mouth around the nipple and the areola (the dark skin around the nipple) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69241 \">figure 2</a>). A good latch-on helps the baby get enough milk and can prevent the mother's nipples from getting hurt. But even with a good latch-on, it can be normal for women to feel a little pain when a feeding starts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147838\"><span class=\"h1\">How often should I breastfeed and how long should a feeding last?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman should breastfeed when her baby shows signs of being hungry. A baby can show that he or she is hungry by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waking up from sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moving the head around as if he or she is looking for the breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sucking on his or her hands, lips, or tongue</p><p/><p>Babies can breastfeed on different schedules and for different amounts of time. For example, some babies finish a feeding in 5 minutes, but others might take 20 minutes or longer.</p><p>Doctors recommend letting the baby finish breastfeeding on one side so that he or she gets all the milk from that breast. Then, you can see if your baby wants to drink from the other breast. The next time you breastfeed, try to remember which breast your baby started on the last time, and start on the other side. Switching the side you start with each time will help both your breasts continue to make milk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147845\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my baby is getting enough breast milk?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can tell if your baby is getting enough breast milk by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checking his or her diapers &ndash; By day 4 or 5 after birth, babies should have at least 6 wet diapers a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checking his or her bowel movements &ndash; By day 4 after birth, babies should have 4 or more bowel movements a day. By day 5, their bowel movements should be yellow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having your doctor or nurse check to see if your baby is gaining weight</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147852\"><span class=\"h1\">Does my baby need any other food or drink?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the first 6 months, most babies need only breast milk. Babies who are breastfed also need to take extra vitamin D. This comes as a liquid that you give your baby using a dropper. Your baby's doctor can talk to you about how to do this and how much vitamin D to give.</p><p>When a baby is between 4 and 6 months old, he or she can start eating and drinking other things, too. Ask your doctor or nurse which foods you can feed your baby and when. You can still continue to breastfeed after your baby starts solid foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147859\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen during breastfeeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women have problems during breastfeeding that can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen, hard, and painful breasts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful or cracked nipples</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast or nipple infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blocked milk ducts, which can cause red and painful breast lumps</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147866\"><span class=\"h1\">How are breastfeeding problems treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breastfeeding problems are treated in different ways. Treatment will depend on the problem. For example, women with swollen, hard, and painful breasts often feel better if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use their hand or a breast pump to let some milk out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73810\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73810 \">figure 3</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use an ice pack or take pain-relieving medicine to treat the pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a warm shower to start their milk flow and let some milk out</p><p/><p>Talk with your doctor or nurse if you are having problems with breastfeeding. Almost all breastfeeding problems can be treated. Some women also find it helpful to talk with a breastfeeding expert called a &quot;lactation consultant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147873\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blocked milk duct that does not get better</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever and a hard, red, and swollen area of the breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood leaking from the nipples</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain that lasts for the whole breastfeeding session</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3503989315\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to change how I eat or drink when I am breastfeeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. You should eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of liquids. If you are trying to lose weight, breastfeeding might help. If you want to drink alcohol, talk to your doctor or nurse about how to do this safely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147887\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I stop breastfeeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If possible, it is a good idea to keep breastfeeding until your baby is about 1 year old. But women choose to stop breastfeeding at different times and for different reasons.</p><p>When you do decide to stop, doctors recommend doing it gradually. You can drop one feeding every 2 to 5 days, or breastfeed for a shorter time each feeding. This will make it easier for your body to adjust. It will also give your baby time to get used to breastfeeding less.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477147978\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-and-nutrition-for-women-who-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health and nutrition for women who breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breastfeeding-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pumping-breast-milk-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pumping breast milk (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Jaundice in babies (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=poor-weight-gain-in-babies-and-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Poor weight gain in babies and children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weaning from breastfeeding (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-guide-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breastfeeding guide (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breastfeeding-problems-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-health-and-nutrition-during-breastfeeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Maternal health and nutrition during breastfeeding (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-breastfeeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weaning from breastfeeding (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pumping-breast-milk-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pumping breast milk (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
