It seems likely, however, that genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors all contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is also reasonable to assume that the skin and joint diseases have a similar pathogenesis, although the activity of these manifestations does not highly correlate in individual patients.

The possible role of genetic factors is illustrated by the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 40 percent of patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have a family history of these disorders in first-degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family studies in PsA have demonstrated that the disease is 55 times more likely to occur among first-degree relatives than among unrelated controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A significantly increased risk of PsA among first-degree relatives of patients with PsA has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The concordance rate for PsA is much higher than that for psoriasis (30 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is greater concordance for psoriasis among monozygotic twins than among dizygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One study of twin pairs with at least one patient with PsA found a similar rate of concordance for PsA in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, arguing against a strong role for a heritable component for PsA, but the results in this relatively small study were imprecise and not conclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A paternal transmission bias for psoriasis and PsA has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">HLA antigens and alleles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discovery of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6 permitted further study of genetic factors in PsA. A number of associations have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-B13, HLA-B17, HLA-B57, and HLA-Cw*0602 occur with increased frequency in patients with PsA compared to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/1,6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following HLA alleles were significantly associated with PsA compared with psoriasis in a multivariate regression analysis that compared 712 PsA patients with 335 psoriasis patients and 713 healthy controls: B*8, B*27, B*38, and C*06. Haplotypes independently associated with PsA compared with psoriasis included HLA-B*18, HLA-C*07, HLA-B*27, HLA-B38, and HLA-B*8. The highest positive predictive value (PPV) was noted with HLA-B27 (assuming a 30 percent prevalence of PsA in patients with psoriasis, the PPV = 0.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PsA, when compared with those with uncomplicated psoriasis, show an increased frequency of the HLA antigens B7 and B27 and a lower frequency of HLA-DR7 and HLA-Cw7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the frequency of HLA-B27 in PsA is not as high as it is in ankylosing spondylitis or in reactive arthritis, and a number of patients with psoriasis and spondyloarthropathy are HLA-B27-negative. In addition, many patients with PsA and HLA-B27 do not have spinal symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several, but not all studies have suggested an association between PsA and HLA-DR4, an antigen that has been shown to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, this association can be demonstrated only in those patients with PsA who have polyarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].<br/><br/>The HLA-DRB1*04 alleles in patients with PsA differ from those in patients with RA. The HLA-DRB1*0401 allele is present less frequently among HLA-DRB1*04-positive patients with PsA than among those with RA, whereas HLA-DRB1*0402 is more frequent in those with PsA than in those with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The prevalence of one or more of the ensemble of HLA-DRB1 alleles associated with RA, collectively referred to as encoding the &ldquo;shared epitope&rdquo; (SE), was not significantly greater in patients PsA than in healthy controls, but the presence of one of these SE alleles was increased in those with erosive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and other susceptibility genes in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Individual alleles and the shared epitope'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA-B27 antigen in the presence of HLA-DR7, HLA-DQ3 in the absence of HLA-DR7, and HLA-B39 are predictors for disease progression, whereas HLA-B22 is protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PSORS1 gene, reported to be HLA-Cw*06:02, is the strongest susceptibility region for psoriasis. In a study of 909 PsA patients, TNF*-857T, a gene that increases transcription of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), is a risk allele for PsA independent of PSORS1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA genotyping of a psoriasis patient cohort and a separate PsA cohort revealed certain haplotypes (C*06.02) more strongly associated with psoriasis and other haplotypes (B*08.01, B*27.05, and B*39.01) associated with PsA but not psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Moreover, certain sub-phenotypes such as enthesitis, dactylitis, and sacroiliitis (asymmetric versus symmetric involvement) were associated with specific HLA haplotypes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a comparison of patients with PsA with patients with psoriasis without musculoskeletal disease (as determined by a rheumatologist), the frequency of HLA-C*0602 was significantly lower in PsA. HLA-C*06 was associated with a longer interval between onset of skin and joint disease, while B*27 alleles were significantly increased in frequency in PsA and associated with a short interval between time of onset of skin and joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The HLA alleles B*8, B*38, and B*39 were increased in frequency in patients with PsA compared with psoriasis alone. HLA-B*27 was associated with sacroiliitis. Certain sub-phenotypes were also associated with specific HLA alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>The exact mechanism of the association between HLA antigens and PsA is not clear. These antigens are thought to be important in antigen presentation and may, therefore, have a pathogenetic role. Alternatively, the HLA antigens may be in linkage disequilibrium with a disease susceptibility gene which may reside at or near the HLA locus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>It has also been suggested that certain immunoglobulin genes may be associated with PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, a gene for psoriasis has been identified on chromosome 17 in some families with familial psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Immunoglobulin-like receptors on natural killer cells (KIR gene products) interact with HLA class I molecules. Different KIR polymorphisms have opposite effects; in one study, carriage of an activating type allele (KIR2DS2 or KIR2DS1) was associated with an increased risk of PsA, but only in those who lacked an appropriate HLA class I ligand for an inhibitory KIR (ie, KIR2DL1 or <span class=\"nowrap\">KIR2DL2/3)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Moreover, there appeared to be a &ldquo;dose response&rdquo; based upon the presence of the appropriate HLA-C ligand in association with the presence of activating KIR. Individuals who had KIR2DS1 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> KIR2DS2 and who were Cw-group homozygous were at most risk, whereas those who lacked KIR2DS1 and KIR2DS2 and who were Cw-group heterozygous were least susceptible to PsA. A subsequent study of a larger cohort of patients with PsA confirmed the association with PsA of KIR2DS2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>These HLA-associated genetic factors have been shown to be important determinants of prognosis in PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The HLA antigens B39, B27, and DQw3 are associated with disease progression, defined on the basis of an increase in clinical deformities. Furthermore, they may be more important prognostically than certain clinical features at presentation, such as the number of affected joints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genome-wide scans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In psoriasis, linkages with loci on chromosomes 1p, 3q, 4q, 6p, 10q, 16q, 17q, 19p, and 20p have been reported in whole genome scans, with the strongest evidence for linkage on chromosome 6p, 10q, 16q, and 17q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/7,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,26-28</a>]. A non-HLA gene was detected within the MHC in psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A segment of chromosome 6 telomeric to the HLA-C locus has been identified by two groups of investigators as closely associated with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. It remains unclear whether the same segment is relevant in PsA. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) in psoriasis has confirmed associations with HLA-C and also identified genes involved in interleukin (IL)-23 signaling (IL-23A, IL-23R, IL-12B), as well as two genes that regulate NF-kappaB, TNIP1, and TNFAIP3 and two genes involved in the modulation of TH2 immune responses IL-4 and IL-13. Moreover, HLA-C, IL-12B, and IL-23R were more significantly associated with psoriasis than PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. TNFAIP3 is thought to limit NF-kappaB-mediated immune responses, and two single REL nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene were associated with the response to anti-TNF agents in psoriasis and PsA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A meta-analysis of GWAS studies on psoriasis, stratified for PsA, found an association of PsA with c-Rel, a member of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Rel/NF-kappaB</span> family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>A genome-wide scan in 100 patients from 39 families with PsA in Iceland identified linkage to a site on chromosome 16q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Further analysis suggested that this genetic locus may be subject to imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon in which only one of two homologous parenteral genes is active. In the case of PsA, the data suggest that inheritance of an allele from the father is more strongly associated with an increased risk of PsA in the children than is maternal inheritance of the same allele.</p><p>A German GWAS in psoriasis identified TRAF3IP2 on 6q21 as being associated with psoriasis, and a stratified analysis confirmed its association with PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A meta-analysis of the two GWAS studies in psoriasis, which also included patients with PsA, identified three further susceptibility loci, including NOS2 (rs4795067), FBXL19 (rs10782001), and one near PSMA6-NFKBIA (rs12586317) for both psoriasis and PsA. The meta-analysis also replicated an association signal near RNF114 (rs495337). A GWAS of 1430 PsA case subjects and 1417 unaffected control subjects was performed. Meta-analysis of this study with three other GWASs and two targeted genotyping studies, encompassing a total of 9293 psoriasis case subjects, 3061 PsA case subjects, 3110 psoriasis without arthritis (cutaneous psoriasis [PsC]) case subjects, and 13,670 unaffected control subjects of European descent, detected 10 regions associated with PsA and 11 with PsC at GW significance. Several of these association signals (IFNLR1, IFIH1, NFKBIA for PsA; TNFRSF9, <span class=\"nowrap\">LCE3C/B,</span> TRAF3IP2, IL23A, NFKBIA for PsC) had not previously achieved GW significance. Among identified psoriasis risk variants, three were more strongly associated with PsC than PsA and two were more strongly associated with PsA than PsC. The PsA-specific variants were independent of previously identified psoriasis variants near IL23R and TNFAIP3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A subsequent study suggested an association with a locus on chromosome 5q31 which was specific for PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidate genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of individual genes in PsA have investigated candidates for disease association, including a number of candidates on chromosome 6p.

Moreover, the limited synovial lining layer hyperplasia, marked vascularity, influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), and lack of intracellular citrullinated proteins and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-C pg 39 peptide complexes are features common to PsA and the other spondyloarthropathies but not to RA synovium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p>A role for T cells in the development of psoriatic skin lesions is suggested by a model in which uninvolved skin from patients with psoriasis is grafted onto mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID mice); typical psoriatic lesions developed if the injected T cells were enriched for CD4-positive T cells but not if they were predominantly CD8-positive T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Activated T cells have generally been found in the affected tissues (both skin and joints) in patients with PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The T cells in synovial fluid are predominantly CD8-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Several studies have shown that cytokines secreted from activated T cells and from other mononuclear proinflammatory cells induce proliferation and activation of synovial and epidermal fibroblasts. It is unclear whether the activated T cells are the cause of the arthritis or are the result of unidentified factors.</p><p>A central question in PsA is whether Th17 cells are pivotal in the pathogenesis of this disease. One report has documented that peripheral blood CD4+IL-17+ and CD8+IL-17+ T cells stimulated ex vivo were increased in frequency both in patients with PsA and patients with RA compared with controls; however, CD8+IL-17+ cells were present at significantly higher frequency in the synovial fluid in patients with PsA, but not in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Moreover, the increased PsA synovial fluid CD8 cells correlated with increases in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and with power Doppler ultrasound findings of active synovitis.</p><p>In another study, group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) were enriched in psoriatic compared with rheumatoid synovial fluid. The ILC3 expressed the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp44 and the chemokine receptor CCR6 and released IL-17 in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Of note was the increased frequency of the NKp44+ ILC3 subset in psoriatic skin as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Additional studies have also found Th17 cells in the psoriatic joint and synovial fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Together with the efficacy of agents that are directed to targets in the <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-23/Th17</span> pathway (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secukinumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ixekizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ixekizumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brodalumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brodalumab</a>), these observations support a Th17 mechanism coupled with inflammation promoted by TNF as key events in PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis#H791398754\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;, section on 'Secukinumab'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis#H57761774\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;, section on 'Ustekinumab'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is proposed that the direct activation of T cells bearing natural killer (NK) receptors for MHC class I triggers psoriasis. NK cell activity in the peripheral blood was shown to be lower than in the synovium in patients with PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. NK cells which have been detected in psoriatic plaques also carry the IL-18 receptor. IL-18 is overexpressed in psoriatic lesional skin compared with human skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>] and is elevated in patients with PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. These findings further support the role of NK cells and KIR receptors in the pathogenesis of PsA.</p><p>Increased numbers of osteoclast precursors have been observed in the peripheral blood of those with erosive PsA when compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients spontaneously secreted higher levels of TNF-alpha than did healthy controls, and receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL, a molecule that promotes osteoclast differentiation) expression was upregulated in the synovial lining layer, while osteoprotegerin (OPG, a soluble molecule that competitively binds RANKL) immunostaining was restricted to the endothelium. The authors of this study suggested that, in inflamed synovium and subchondral bone, osteoclast progenitors are exposed to unopposed RANKL and TNF-alpha. This leads to osteoclastogenesis at the erosion front and in subchondral bone. The resulting bidirectional assault on psoriatic bone thus leads to bony erosions. The mechanisms that lead to peripheral (ankylosis, periostitis, enthesophytes) and central (syndesmophytes) bone formation in PsA are not well-understood, although evidence does support the view that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Wnt, and prostaglandin E signaling pathways are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>Monocytes may also play a role in the pathogenesis of PsA. Resting monocytes from patients had significantly reduced density of a beta-2 integrin (CD11b) compared with controls, but activation of the monocytes generated upregulation of most adhesion molecules comparable with controls. The authors suggest that the impaired adhesion, as well as transendothelial migration of monocytes of patients with PsA, can be explained by the reduced expression of the <span class=\"nowrap\">CD11b/CD18</span> dimer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. In addition, increased production of <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophage</span> derived metalloproteinases has been demonstrated in the synovium of patients with PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>The concept of a synovio-entheseal complex (SEC) has been proposed, in which, in health, the synovium provides nourishment and lubrication to the entheseal fibrocartilage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. When a mechanically stressed enthesis is injured, the associated inflammatory reaction would be manifested in the juxtaposed synovium. In a collagen-induced arthritis murine model, enthesitis and entheseal new bone formation were directed by CD3+CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> T cells in response to IL-23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. The demonstration of altered vascularity at enthesis insertion sites, particularly in the presence of microdamage and ensuing repair, suggests that local biomechanical factors and local trauma may also drive the entheseal inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several environmental factors have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), including infections (both bacterial and viral) and trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/68,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,89</a>]. For example, an association with streptococcal infection has been proposed, and this view is supported by improvement in skin lesions in psoriasis patients who underwent tonsillectomy and by the degree of clinical improvement correlated with a decrease in the frequency of peptide reactive (streptococcal M proteins, keratin) CLA<sup>+</sup> skin-homing T cells in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The finding that 16S-based sequencing of psoriatic plaques showed increased bacterial diversity, including more <em>Streptococcus</em>, compared with skin biopsies from controls raised the possibility that microbiomal factors may drive inflammatory pathways in psoriatic skin and joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Psoriasis may develop at sites of trauma (called the Koebner phenomenon). Furthermore, some patients with PsA provide a history of preceding trauma prior to the onset of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/56,92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,92,93</a>]. A case-control study of patients with PsA and psoriasis-identified rubella vaccination, injury, house moving, recurrent oral ulcers, and bone fractures to be associated with the development of inflammatory arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Obesity, which is a risk factor for psoriasis, may also convey increased risk for PsA; body mass index at age 18 increased risk by a statistically significant but small degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. A case-control study identified lifting of heavy loads and infections requiring hospitalization as associated with the development of PsA; this study did not confirm the association of rubella vaccination or fractures with PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. An inverse association of smoking with PsA has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. This association was particularly relevant to patients who did not carry the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C*06 allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3978615569\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
