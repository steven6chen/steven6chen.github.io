Among these patients, hypertension may developed de novo or may worsen after introducing ESAs. However, since hypertension in CKD patients may be due to several factors including volume overload, erythropoietin-related hypertension should be a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p>This topic reviews hypertension related to erythropoietin among CKD patients. Other issues related to erythropoietin among CKD patients, including hemoglobin (Hb) targets, are addressed elsewhere.

A phase-III trial involving 251 hemodialysis patients found that 35 percent of patients developed an increase in their diastolic blood pressure (BP) of at least 10 mmHg or required an increase in their antihypertensive agents after three months of ESA therapy. Moreover, 44 percent of patients who were not hypertensive at baseline also had an increase in diastolic BP of at least 10 mmHg, and one-third of them were started on antihypertensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Much of the evidence that ESAs contribute to hypertension in CKD patients was derived from a series of meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. As an example, in one meta-analysis that included six randomized trials comparing erythropoietin versus placebo or no erythropoietin (n = 387 patients), patients who did not receive erythropoietin had a lower risk of hypertension (relative risk [RR] 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.76).</p><p>Another meta-analysis from the Cochrane Collaboration that included four controlled trials in nondialysis CKD patients showed a 26 percent higher risk of hypertension in erythropoietin-treated patients compared with no erythropoietin or placebo, but the effect was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A more recent meta-analysis of the effects of ESA treatment compared with placebo or no treatment on hypertension was provided from 24 studies in 9930 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The magnitude of the BP increase is greater in hemodialysis than in predialysis or CAPD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,14</a>]. Hypertension following erythropoietin may be more frequent in patients with a personal or family history of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The risk of hypertension is increased by targeting higher Hb concentrations. This was suggested by the CREATE study, which reported a greater than 50 percent increase in risk for developing hypertension in patients targeted to a Hb of 13 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> compared with those targeted to 10.5 to 11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A meta-analysis comprising nine studies, including the CREATE study, also reported a higher risk of poorly controlled BP in patients targeted to higher Hb levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A meta-analysis that included 27 studies concluded that targeting higher Hb levels with ESA therapy worsens hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two factors were thought to be associated with hypertension: the high doses of erythropoietin administered and the rapid rate of increase in Hb concentration. A high ESA dose was associated with increased risk of hypertension in a meta-regression analysis that included 31 randomized, controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the association between ESA dose and hypertension was not significant after adjusting for target Hb concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Antiplatelet agents may reduce the risk of erythropoietin-induced hypertension. In one study, for example, the incidence of hypertension after erythropoietin was only 6 percent in patients treated with one of these drugs as compared with 56 percent in those not receiving antiplatelet therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Why this might occur is not clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying mechanisms that increase the blood pressure (BP) level in ESA-treated patients remain poorly defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The effect seems to be independent of ESA effect on red blood cell volume and viscosity. It seems that there are separate epitopes on the erythropoietin protein: One epitope is involved in mediating erythropoiesis, and another mediates the effects on BP increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Pertinent to this is that erythropoietin receptors are expressed on vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells and thus may facilitate a role for erythropoietin in cellular signal transduction pathways that triggers vasoconstriction and possibly an increase in BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A consistent finding in experimental and clinical studies is increased systemic and renal vasoconstriction. This effect may be mediated, at least in part, by the direct vasoconstrictor action of erythropoietin on renal resistance vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Intra-arterial infusions of norepinephrine in anemic patients on hemodialysis caused a decrease in forearm blood flow and an increase in forearm vascular resistance that was significantly less than that found in healthy controls. Repeat studies performed after 6 and 12 weeks of erythropoietin therapy demonstrated that vascular responsiveness to norepinephrine had been restored to values equal to or greater than the control subjects. Mean arterial pressure also significantly increased during erythropoietin therapy. An almost fourfold increase in vasoconstrictor sensitivity to alpha adrenergic stimuli was also evident in the venous circulation of erythropoietin-treated hemodialysis patients compared with healthy subjects, but vasorelaxation in response to bradykinin was unchanged in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Of note, erythropoietin infusion into hand veins of healthy subjects produced no vasoconstriction.</p><p>High doses of ESA may limit endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) production, which contributes to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

Why this occurs is not well understood, but impaired myocardial compliance resulting from the cardiac hypertrophy commonly seen in uremia may be an important factor. In older adult patients treated with erythropoietin, the high cardiac output gradually falls over a period of one year and is accompanied by a 25 percent reduction in left ventricular mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Endothelin is a very potent vasoconstrictor peptide that may play a role in ESA-induced hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. In one study, among 51 maintenance hemodialysis patients, 19 had an increase in BP after eight weeks of treatment with erythropoietin. There was an increase in plasma immunoreactive (IR) endothelin concentrations only in the patients with an increase in mean BP greater than 10 mmHg. The increases in plasma IR-endothelin concentrations correlated with the increase in mean BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The increase in blood pressure (BP) is usually mild, but hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hypertensive encephalopathy'</a> below.)</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, some chronically hypotensive dialysis patients show an improvement in BP following erythropoietin therapy. However, this does not appear to be associated with a lessening of hemodynamic instability during dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertensive encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertensive encephalopathy, sometimes accompanied by seizures, may occur when erythropoietin causes a rapid rise in BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Hyperperfusion of the cerebral circulation due to a breakdown of cerebral autoregulation may be important in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is not possible to predict in advance who will develop this complication; as a result, prodromal symptoms (such as persistent headache or visual disturbances) must be looked for, particularly in previously normotensive individuals in the early weeks and months after the institution of erythropoietin therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION AND TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with pre-existing severe hypertension, we usually delay the administration of ESAs until the blood pressure (BP) is controlled by antihypertensive medications and volume removal. For dialysis patients, we try to achieve the estimated dry weight before starting an ESA. Subsequently, BP must be closely monitored in all patients with CKD during initiation of ESAs.</p><p>Therapy of ESA-induced hypertension begins with prevention. The risk of hypertension can be ameliorated by raising the hemoglobin (Hb) <strong>slowly</strong>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The HIF-mediated transcriptional cascade involves many genes that participate in vasomotor control. Studies suggest that the balance between HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha is critical for the maintenance of systemic arterial pressure. There is limited evidence for a small BP-lowering effect of several PHD inhibitors including BAY 85-3934, FG-2216, FG-4592, and AKB-6548. However, as of to date, it is premature to conclude that these agents have a predictable BP-lowering effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Patients who remain hypertensive can be treated with fluid removal (via ultrafiltration during dialysis or, if the patient has only CKD, diuretics) and the administration of antihypertensive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-following-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Any of the conventional antihypertensive agents can be used to control BP, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, and vasodilators (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment of hypertension in chronic kidney disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-dialysis-patients#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>).
