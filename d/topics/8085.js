Some form of anticoagulation, usually with heparin, is required to prevent thrombosis in the blood circuit. Strategies to minimize the risk of bleeding include low-dose or &quot;minimum heparin&quot; as well as fast-flow &quot;no-heparin&quot; methods. Regional anticoagulation with citrate, prostacyclin, as well as heparin-protamine have also been used. The bleeding tendency induced by these regimens is additive to the commonly present platelet dysfunction associated with advanced renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-dysfunction-in-uremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet dysfunction in uremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anticoagulation during hemodialysis can be monitored by the determination of activated clotting times (ACTs). However, although ACTs have advantages over whole blood clotting times in that they are interpreted by an automated method with rapid results, they are infrequently used because of quality assurance and regulatory issues.</p><p>In general, most outpatient dialysis units do not routinely measure anticoagulation parameters, unless there is an issue with dialyzer clotting or prolonged bleeding following dialysis. Usually, each dialysis unit has a protocol that is followed. This topic discussed anticoagulation in maintenance intermittent hemodialysis. Anticoagulation for continuous therapies is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STANDARD ANTICOAGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulation in routine hemodialysis consists of a standard dose of heparin given as a bolus at the start of the dialysis treatment, with a mid-treatment dose to maintain suitable anticoagulation. Alternatively, heparin modeling can be performed using an initial bolus followed by a constant fixed infusion of heparin to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) of 200 to 250 seconds (normal = 90 to 140 seconds).</p><p>The ACT (activated whole blood clotting time) is performed by addition of an activating agent (eg, celite, kaolin) to a sample of freshly drawn whole blood and measuring the time (in seconds) for formation of a clot (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests#H3398075677\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;, section on 'Monitoring high-dose heparin (ACT)'</a>). This therapy ensures systemic anticoagulation throughout the dialysis treatment. It is reliable and requires minimal staff intervention after a patient's heparin dose is determined (based on ACT goal).</p><p>Some protocols use higher heparin doses with decreasing infusion rates as the treatment proceeds to minimize postdialysis bleeding from venipuncture sites. These methods require minimal staff intervention and are standard in most outpatient hemodialysis units; they are, however, unsuitable for patients with significant bleeding risks. The exact dosing varies among nephrologists, but an example of initial dosing would be a 2000 unit heparin bolus at initiation of dialysis then a continuous infusion of 500 units per hour, turning off the infusion in the last half-hour. Dosing adjustments are made depending on the clotting tendencies of the circuit for the individual patient.</p><p>Dialyzer clotting is a common factor underlying poor performance with dialyzer reuse, resulting in an enhanced frequency of discarded dialyzers. The adoption of an improved heparin dosing regimen with routine dialysis may increase the rate of reuse. In one study of 44 chronic hemodialysis patients, the use of a mathematical model system that determined the optimal heparin loading dose and infusion rate (to attain a whole blood intradialytic clotting time of 150 percent of the predialysis level) significantly increased dialyzer reuse rates among the modeled, but not control, patient group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTICOAGULATION IN HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS AT RISK FOR BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The table lists the risk factors for bleeding with hemodialysis anticoagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F114870\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114870 \">table 1</a>). High-risk patients should be dialyzed without heparin or undergo citrate hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (if feasible). Medium-risk patients may receive low-dose (or tight) heparin or no <span class=\"nowrap\">heparin/citrate</span> protocols. We use no heparin if there is any doubt about the risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">No-heparin hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No-heparin hemodialysis was developed for use in the patient at high risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The protocol requires pretreating both the dialyzer and blood lines with 2000 to 5000 units of heparin contained in a liter of normal saline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56596\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56596 \">figure 1</a>). The heparinized saline is flushed from the extracorporeal lines prior to the start of the dialysis treatment so that heparin is not administered to the patient. Extracorporeal blood flows are rapidly increased to 250 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and maintained throughout the treatment, and 25 to 30 mL saline flushes are administered every 15 to 30 minutes into the arterial (predialyzer) limb to minimize hemoconcentration and to wash fibrin strands from the kidney into the bubble trap. The volume of saline administered with such frequent flushing must be removed during the dialysis to prevent hypervolemia. One-to-one nursing is required, with careful monitoring of the arterial and venous pressure alarms to detect early clotting.</p><p>No-heparin hemodialysis can be used in approximately 90 percent of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with temporary venous access, with only a 2 percent clotting rate in the extracorporeal circuit. There is no significant loss of clearances compared with control patients treated with full anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Disadvantages of this technique include the need for close nursing observation and the necessity to convert to minimum-dose heparin or stop treatment in 5 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Blood transfusions during no-heparin hemodialysis require additional vascular access due to the increased risk of clotting in the dialyzer circuit. However, the availability of additional peripheral access is limited in some patients. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a technique based upon the insertion of a large-bore stopcock permits the transfusion of blood into the venous outflow limb without significant difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimum-dose heparin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of minimum-dose heparin has been shown to reduce bleeding complications in high-risk patients when compared with regional heparinization with protamine neutralization (10 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The protocol usually involves boluses of 500 units of heparin every 30 minutes to keep the activated clotting time &gt;150 but &lt;200 seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80980\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80980 \">figure 2</a>). Alternately, a continuous infusion of heparin with frequent activated clotting time (ACT) monitoring can be used to achieve the same degree of anticoagulation.</p><p>The major advantage of this technique is that no additional equipment is needed in the dialysis circuit. The major disadvantage is that some minimal degree of anticoagulation of the patient still occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional anticoagulation with protamine reversal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest method described to reduce hemodialysis-associated bleeding was regional anticoagulation with protamine reversal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. This procedure involves the constant infusion of heparin into the dialyzer inlet line and the simultaneous, constant infusion of protamine prior to the blood returning to the patient (protamine binds to heparin and eliminates its anticoagulant activity) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74909\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74909 \">figure 3</a>). The infusion pump rates are adjusted to keep the whole blood ACT in the dialyzer circuit at 250 seconds and the blood returning to the patient at its predialysis baseline. The protamine dose to neutralize the heparin can be determined by the protamine titration test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Protamine reversal has been largely abandoned due to its technical difficulties and to problems with rebound bleeding two to four hours after the end of dialysis as the reticuloendothelial system releases free heparin from the protamine-heparin complex back into the general circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, simpler regimens consisting of minimum-dose and no-dose heparin as well as citrate regional anticoagulation have subsequently been developed that offer a lower incidence of bleeding complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional citrate anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The regional citrate regimen that has been adopted in many institutions involves the continuous infusion of isosmotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trisodium-citrate-solution-anticoagulant-sodium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trisodium citrate solution</a> (102 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> into the arterial side of the dialyzer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67592\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67592 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The fall in the free plasma calcium concentration induced by binding to citrate is responsible for the anticoagulant activity of this regimen by preventing the progression of the coagulation cascade. The citrate-calcium complex is removed across the dialyzer, and a calcium-free dialysate can also be used to further reduce the free calcium level in the blood. The citrate infusion rate is adjusted to keep the ACT above 200 seconds in the arterial limb.</p><p>Regional anticoagulation is reversed by the infusion of 5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> into the venous return line at a rate of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. This rate is constantly adjusted according to frequent measurements of plasma calcium concentration to prevent hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia. Several modifications of this technique have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Comparative trials have shown a reduced incidence of bleeding with these regimens when compared with standard heparin protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The major problem with regional citrate anticoagulation is hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia, hypernatremia (due to the hypertonic sodium citrate solution), and metabolic alkalosis (due to bicarbonate generated during the metabolism of citrate) that may require hydrochloric acid infusion. If closely monitored, however, the complication rate is relatively low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Specifically designed dialysate may also lower the incidence of electrolyte abnormalities, including metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Citrate dialysate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of citric acid as the acid in dialysate concentrates has been described. Citric acid-based dialysates result in reduced clotting in no-heparin dialysis (by lowering serum calcium enough to interfere with the clotting cascade but not enough to cause symptomatic hypocalcemia) and increases patient bicarbonate levels (by the conversion of citrate to bicarbonate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The major disadvantage is that, at a citric acid concentration of 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> a small but significant change in serum calcium does occur, although usually not enough to cause symptoms. Further studies are needed to delineate the role of citric acid-based dialysates. It is commercially available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostacyclin regional anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arachidonic metabolite prostacyclin is a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Its in vitro half-life is three to five minutes due to rapid metabolism by endothelial smooth muscle. Prostacyclin regional anticoagulation involves the infusion of prostacyclin into the dialyzer circuit at 4 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/kg/minute</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Side effects include headache, lightheadedness, and facial flushing. However, its use has been limited by hypotension due to vasodilation and expense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Nafamostat, a prostacyclin analog without the hypotensive activity, is not yet available in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It may, however, be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of clot formation. In one study using nafamostat, clot formation was observed in up to 36 percent of dialyzers despite adequate prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, nafamostat cannot be used with polyacrylonitrile membranes, due to adsorption onto the membrane surface.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional agents have been evaluated in hemodialysis patients at risk of bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Low-molecular-weight heparin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of heparin in clinical use is polydispersed unmodified heparin (mean molecular weight ranging from 10,000 to 16,000 daltons). Low-molecular-weight (LMW) derivatives of commercial heparin have been prepared that have a mean molecular weight of 4000 to 5000 daltons (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct oral anticoagulants and parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>). Like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, LMW heparins inactivate factor Xa, but they have a lesser effect on thrombin because most of the molecules do not contain enough saccharide units to bind to form the ternary complex, in which thrombin and antithrombin (AT III) are bound simultaneously.</p><p>LMW heparin has been proposed to cause less bleeding and less thrombocytopenia than heparin. However, these agents are very expensive and have generally not been found to be superior to heparin in terms of dialysis-related bleeding or other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This is supported by the findings of a meta-analysis showing that LMW heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> were similarly safe and effective in preventing extracorporeal circuit thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The safety and efficacy of LMW heparin are also equivalent if administered via the arterial or venous route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct oral anticoagulants and parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A randomized, crossover trial also found no benefit with LMW heparin compared with citrate in chronic hemodialysis patients at risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Unlike citrate, LMW heparin was found to induce systemic anticoagulation, although this effect was diminished by a divided-dose regimen.</p><p>An additional problem is that monitoring with the aPTT is not accurate with LMW heparin; in this setting, measurement of heparinoid or anti-factor Xa levels provide a better indication of the degree of anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, once a patient develops heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), LMW heparin <strong>cannot</strong> be used as a safe substitute. There is extensive crossreactivity (&gt;90 percent) between the LMW heparin and standard heparin in terms of antibody recognition, and the thrombocytopenia and hypercoagulable state may persist when a patient with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is switched from standard heparin to LMW heparin. The main clinical concern in this disorder is a high incidence of thrombosis, not bleeding.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Standard anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Options for patients on hemodialysis who are at high risk for bleeding include no-heparin hemodialysis, minimum-dose heparin, regional anticoagulation with protamine reversal, regional citrate anticoagulation, citrate dialysate, and prostacyclin regional anticoagulation. No-heparin and regional citrate anticoagulation are associated with the lowest risks of bleeding and severe dialyzer clotting. Protamine reversal has been largely abandoned due to its technical difficulties and to problems with rebound bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients at risk for bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Options for patients who have developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) include no-heparin hemodialysis, regional citrate hemodialysis, a change to peritoneal dialysis, or the administration of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danaparoid-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danaparoid</a> (which is a heparinoid and <strong>not</strong> a low-molecular-weight [LMW] heparin) or recombinant hirudin (lepirudin). The preferred option for patients with HIT is no-heparin hemodialysis. If no-heparin dialysis cannot be performed, the patient should be converted to peritoneal dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct oral anticoagulants and parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis catheter lock options in patients with HIT are to pressure bag the catheters (which is impractical for outpatients) or to use either tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Catheter lock issues'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodialysis-anticoagulation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ouseph R, Brier ME, Ward RA.
