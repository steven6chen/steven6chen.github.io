Typically, all fetuses of a multiple gestation deliver within a short interval; however, in selected cases, the preterm birth of one fetus may not require delivery of the other fetus(es). An extended time interval between births of siblings at a critical gestational age may improve neonatal survival and reduce morbidity from preterm birth.</p><p>This topic will discuss selection of candidates for delayed-interval delivery and management of these pregnancies. Interpretation of available information is challenging because the evidence base consists of case reports, small case series, and literature reviews, but no randomized trials. Ascertainment bias is a significant problem as successful outcomes often are reported, while many unsuccessful cases go unreported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES FOR DELAYED-INTERVAL DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We discuss the option of delayed-interval delivery with patients when delivery of some fetuses of a multiple gestation is indicated because of maternal, obstetrical, or fetal factors and concurrent delivery of fetuses unaffected by these factors would likely result in their death or severe morbidity. This is a rare event and a complex clinical decision as it is difficult to objectively quantify and compare the potential risks and benefits for the various stakeholders. There are no high-quality data on which to select or exclude candidates for delayed-interval delivery and no generally accepted, published guidelines for selection of appropriate pregnancies.</p><p>We believe the best candidates for delayed-interval delivery are pregnancies at an early gestational age (&lt;24 weeks) in which only the first (presenting) fetus spontaneously delivers due to preterm labor, cervical insufficiency, premature rupture of membranes, or intrauterine demise.</p><p>We do not offer delayed-interval delivery to women with pregnancies &ge;28 weeks of gestation because neonatal outcome at our institution is generally good at this gestational age. We also avoid delayed-interval delivery in women with pregnancy complications associated with a high risk of serious maternal or fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">morbidity/mortality</span> in ongoing pregnancies, such as severe preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, and intraamniotic infection of the nonpresenting fetus(es). In our practice, the finding of intraamniotic infection involving the first fetus or the requirement for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> augmentation to facilitate its delivery does not exclude the woman as a candidate for a delayed-interval delivery; however, evidence of intraamniotic infection (by amniocentesis) of the retained siblings would be a contraindication to this approach and would require delivery of the entire pregnancy.</p><p>We consider monochorionicity an exclusion criterion because vascular anastomoses in the retained placenta may cause complications in the retained fetus(es), although successful delayed-interval delivery has been reported in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We also consider the need for cesarean delivery of the first fetus a relative contraindication to offering delayed-interval delivery; however, single case reports of selective hysterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] or operative vaginal evacuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] for delivery of one sibling with successful outcomes for the retained siblings have been described. In our practice, if the first fetus is viable and breech, we generally perform cesarean delivery and do not attempt delayed-interval delivery of the remaining fetuses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5660082\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMED CONSENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We discuss the potential benefits and risks of delayed-interval delivery and the range of potential outcomes as part of informed consent.

Regardless of gestational age, parents may choose to deliver the entire pregnancy when one fetus of a multiple gestation delivers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delaying delivery increases the risk of maternal, fetal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatal infection and, in turn, the potential sequelae of infection (eg, infertility, periviable or preterm birth, neurodevelopmental impairment, death). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intra-amniotic-infection-clinical-chorioamnionitis-or-triple-i#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intra-amniotic infection (clinical chorioamnionitis or triple I)&quot;, section on 'Fetal and neonatal outcome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential benefit of delaying delivery depends on both the gestational age at delivery of the first fetus and latency duration. A three-week latency interval is of considerable value if the first fetus delivered at 23 weeks, but not if it delivered at 17 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of extending the pregnancy from a previable to a periviable gestational age is a concern that should be raised in the counseling and consent process. Potentially appropriate candidates for delayed-interval delivery who are at a previable gestational age may elect not to attempt an approach that increases the possibility of birth of an extremely preterm infant who survives with significant long-term morbidity. These patients can reasonably choose to deliver the entire pregnancy at the time of delivery of the firstborn infant.

Intraamniotic infection is a common cause of failure to prolong pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>].</p><p>The amniotic fluid is sent to the laboratory for Gram stain, culture, leukocyte count, and glucose concentration.

If maternal signs of clinical chorioamnionitis do not quickly resolve with delivery of the first fetus and antibiotic therapy, we repeat amniocentesis and testing for intraamniotic infection.

A tocolytic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>, is administered and continued for 24 to 48 hours postoperatively, depending on uterine activity.</p><p>This clinical scenario could occur in a multiple gestation with premature rupture of membranes at 22 weeks with evidence of intraamniotic infection of the presenting fetus, but no evidence of infection in the other fetus(s). Waiting for spontaneous active labor may increase the risk of development of infection in the other siblings and maternal systemic signs of chorioamnionitis. Therefore, we augment labor with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>, as needed, and then inhibit uterine activity after the delivery, as described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5660039\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lower uterine segment is irrigated with 500 to 1000 mL of an antibiotic solution (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a> 50,000 units per liter of saline), using an irrigating syringe.

An important reason to consider cerclage is that silent cervical dilatation may have played a role in the early birth of the first sibling. If this is a possibility, then cerclage may forestall the birth of the remaining sibling(s). Because it is usually impossible to exclude the possibility that cervical insufficiency was a contributing factor to the early delivery of the first fetus, we generally perform a cerclage in all patients attempting delayed-interval delivery. Even if cervical insufficiency was not initially a contributing factor, reapproximation of the cervix after delivery of the first fetus may prevent future prolapse of fetal membranes and decrease the risk of development of intraamniotic infection. However, there are numerous reports of successful delayed-interval deliveries without surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/3,10,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,22,23</a>].</p><p>We place a McDonald cerclage using #2 monofilament nonabsorbable suture swaged onto a medium taper needle. Two sutures are initially placed, the second is offset by 45 degrees so as not to be placed directly on top of the first suture. Additionally, we often place a &quot;box suture&quot; from 12 '&rsquo;clock to 6 o'clock to close any distal patulous cervix. &#160;</p><p>Repeat cerclage is unlikely to be successful in pregnancies where a cerclage had been placed earlier in pregnancy, before delivery of the first sibling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This group of patients have a more guarded prognosis, due to a particularly foreshortened latency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531183686\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A course of antenatal glucocorticoids are administered to pregnancies &ge;23<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</sup></span> weeks since only a few primitive alveoli are present below this gestational age. Earlier administration in the 22<sup>nd</sup> week is reasonable if delivery at 23 weeks is anticipated and aggressive neonatal intervention is planned after thorough periviability counseling.

We administer a rescue (salvage) course after a two-week latency interval from the first course, if clinical factors suggest delivery may be imminent; otherwise, we wait until approximately 31 weeks of gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200613709\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal and fetal monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is kept in the hospital for a minimum of seven days as many unsuccessful attempts at delayed delivery will declare themselves within this seven-day period (eg, occurrence of maternal infection, preterm rupture of membranes, preterm labor, or nonreassuring fetal status) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>We monitor viable fetuses with electronic fetal heart rate monitoring for at least 30 minutes, three times daily.

A relatively long cervix without funneling past the plane of the cerclage is reassuring that delivery is not imminent, especially in a patient without uterine activity. Conversely, if the cervical length shortens or the plane of the cerclage is broached, especially in patients with some uterine activity, then readmission for closer surveillance may be indicated, depending on gestational age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key outcomes of delayed delivery of multiple gestations are latency interval, perinatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, and maternal morbidity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Latency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Latency is important since achieving an extended time interval between births of siblings at critical gestational ages is the basis for improved neonatal survival and reduced morbidity in siblings. In two large series, mean latency was 18 to 19 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and 36 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; in two other large series, median latency was 6 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and 16 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the duration of latency reported in the literature is extremely wide, ranging from 1 to 152 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/2,5,8,10,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,8,10,23</a>].</p><p>In one study, gestational age &le;24 weeks at delivery of the first sibling was associated with longer latency (&ge;49 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but not in another study (latency &ge;22 days in 9 percent of first deliveries at 17 to 23 weeks versus 16 percent of first deliveries at 24 to 29 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

These delayed-interval deliveries were matched to nondelayed twin deliveries presenting at the same gestational ages and delivered contemporaneously. One-year survival rates more than doubled for second twins delivered after a delay, compared with those managed with usual <span class=\"nowrap\">care/delivery</span> (56 versus 24 percent, respectively). Infant mortality for firstborn twins in each group was approximately 70 percent.</p><p>In a 2016 systematic review from Belgium, the retained sibling had a survival benefit in delayed-interval delivery, irrespective of whether the birth of the first fetus was before or after 24 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, others have reported that the prognosis for an individual patient is highly dependent on the gestational age at which the first multiple delivers. In a study not included in the review in which delayed-interval delivery was attempted early in gestation (&gt;16 weeks), survival of firstborns was only 16 percent, and survival of retained siblings was only 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

This highlights the small, but potentially life-threatening, risk of delaying delivery after the birth of one sibling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed-interval delivery may be an option when some fetuses of a multiple gestation deliver because of maternal, obstetrical, or fetal factors and concurrent delivery of fetuses unaffected by these factors would likely result in their death or severe morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Appropriate candidates for delayed-interval delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modest intervals between the birth of siblings at critical gestational ages can improve neonatal survival and decrease neonatal morbidity among the second-born survivors. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal strategy to achieve a successful delayed-interval delivery has not been validated by randomized studies, nor have there been adequate sample sizes in observational studies to draw statistically meaningful conclusions. There is no consensus as to optimum management of potential candidates for delayed-interval delivery. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We believe the best candidates for delayed-interval delivery are pregnancies at an early gestational age (&lt;24 weeks) in which only the first (presenting) fetus delivers due to preterm labor, cervical insufficiency, premature rupture of membranes, or intrauterine demise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We do not offer delayed-interval delivery to women with pregnancy complications associated with a high risk of serious maternal or fetal injury (eg, severe preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, intraamniotic infection of the nonpresenting fetus) or gestational age &ge;28 weeks. We consider monochorionicity and the need for cesarean delivery of the first fetus relative contraindications, but do not consider intraamniotic infection limited to the first fetus a contraindication. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Appropriate candidates for delayed-interval delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The counseling and consent process should address the risks and benefits of delayed-interval delivery, including the possibility and consequences of extending the pregnancy from a previable to a periviable gestational age; the risk of maternal, fetal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatal infection, as well as potential sequelae of infection; and the option of not attempting delayed-interval delivery. (See <a href=\"#H5660082\" class=\"local\">'Informed consent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to an attempt at delayed-interval delivery, we perform amniocentesis to exclude subclinical microbial invasion of the amniotic fluid of the proposed retained sibling(s). (See <a href=\"#H5659976\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing delayed-interval delivery, we perform high ligation of the umbilical cord with absorbable suture and leave the placenta in situ, administer local and systemic antibiotics, and place a cerclage. If uterine relaxation is necessary, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> followed by a tocolytic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Management of delayed-interval delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ongoing maternal and fetal surveillance during latency involves assessment for signs of infection, premature labor, premature rupture of membranes, cervical change, fetal heart rate abnormalities, and other complications. (See <a href=\"#H200613709\" class=\"local\">'Maternal and fetal monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Postdischarge care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer a first course of antenatal glucocorticoids at viability and a rescue (salvage) course after a two-week latency interval from the first course, if clinical factors suggest delivery may be imminent; otherwise, we wait until approximately 31 weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"#H531183686\" class=\"local\">'Antenatal glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Length of latency is important since achieving an extended time interval between births of siblings at critical gestational ages is the basis for improved neonatal survival and reduced morbidity in siblings. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Latency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In several series, survival rates for firstborns delivered at &gt;24 to 25 weeks was 53 to 64 percent and 74 to 100 percent for their retained siblings. This is higher than the survival rate reported in a series where delayed-interval delivery was performed remote from viability (&gt;16 weeks). In this series, survival of firstborns was 16 percent, and survival of retained siblings was 54 percent, highlighting the prognostic importance of the gestational age when the first multiple delivers. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal morbidity is primarily dependent on gestational age at birth. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal morbidity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious maternal morbidity, such as severe hemorrhage or infection, has been reported in one-third of women. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Maternal morbidity'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-interval-delivery-in-multifetal-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Beinder E, Lang N.
