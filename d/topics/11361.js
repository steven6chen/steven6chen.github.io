MEN1 also includes a predisposition to gastrinomas in the duodenum, carcinoids, adrenal adenomas, angiofibromas, and lipomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 2</a>). The tumors are generally benign, but malignancy of some carcinoid, islet cell, and gastrointestinal tract tumors are important causes of mortality in MEN1.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of MEN1. The classification, genetics, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Definition and genetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PARATHYROID TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple parathyroid tumors causing primary hyperparathyroidism are the most common manifestation of MEN1, with over 90 percent penetrance by age 40 to 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Multiple gland involvement is common in these patients and, given sufficient time, perhaps universal. Patients with classical MEN1 are at high risk of recurrent hyperparathyroidism after apparently successful subtotal parathyroidectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the biochemical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is confirmed in a patient with known or presumed MEN1, the indications for surgical intervention are similar to those in patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism. These include symptomatic or marked hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, and evidence of bone disease such as diminished bone density or fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Bone density of the lumbar spine and hip can improve after parathyroidectomy in patients with hyperparathyroidism associated with MEN1, as it does in patients with sporadic hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-management#H19948260\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management&quot;, section on 'Candidates for surgery'</a>.)</p><p>An additional indication for parathyroidectomy in patients with MEN1 is the presence of severe peptic ulcer disease or other symptoms caused by a gastrinoma (the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) that are difficult to control with medications. Hypercalcemia typically worsens hypergastrinemia, and parathyroidectomy may markedly reduce gastrin secretion in patients with a gastrinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The typical high success of pharmacologic therapy for hypergastrinemia makes this a rare indication for operation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of asymptomatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery or no therapy can be acceptable alternatives for patients with MEN1 who have asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic hyperparathyroidism, as they are for patients with sporadic hyperparathyroidism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management&quot;</a>). Whether early treatment of hyperparathyroidism reduces mortality or morbidity in patients with MEN1 is not known, but many clinicians lean toward surgery in young patients because of their long life expectancy (and years at risk for developing bone disease). On the other hand, other clinicians defer surgery as long as possible, in the hope that fewer operations for recurrent hyperparathyroidism (which may be more difficult than the initial surgery) will be needed during the patient's lifetime.</p><p>The clinician's threshold for recommending surgery for patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism bears importantly on the decision to screen asymptomatic persons at risk (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H24809205\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Screening of family members in MEN1 kindreds'</a>). Such decisions must also take into account the level of surgical expertise available at one's institution, an important consideration because of the likelihood of recurrent hyperparathyroidism and need for another operation in the future.</p><p>We tend to defer surgery in MEN1 patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism who also lack specific indications for surgery, such as diminished bone density. In such patients, periodic monitoring should be performed for disease progression and development of indications for surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-management#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>We do, however, tend to recommend surgery for asymptomatic patients with reduced bone density for the reasons mentioned above and, therefore, find it reasonable to regularly screen individuals with MEN1 for biochemical hyperparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H14907078\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Screening for MEN1-associated tumors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative localization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with MEN1 have multiple parathyroid tumors so bilateral exploration of previously unoperated patients should be planned, regardless of the outcome of preoperative localization studies, such as ultrasonography, sestamibi imaging, or chest computed tomography (CT). However, the surgeon may find these studies to be anatomically helpful and may therefore order them. We recommend localization studies before reoperation in patients with recurrent or persistent disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative localization for parathyroid surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In observational studies, persistent disease is more common among patients who were treated with less than subtotal parathyroidectomy (42 versus 0 to 12 percent in patients with less than three versus three or more glands resected) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Thus, for patients with MEN1 and indications for parathyroidectomy, we recommend subtotal (three and one-half gland) parathyroidectomy rather than removal of fewer glands.</p><p>Patients with classical MEN1 are at high risk of recurrent hyperparathyroidism after apparently successful subtotal parathyroidectomy; this finding reflects the strong and seemingly inexorable proliferative drive in parathyroid cells in this disorder. One report from the National Institutes of Health, for example, found a recurrence rate of greater than 50 percent at 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; in another report, the recurrence rate was 67 percent at eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Bilateral neck exploration should be performed to attempt to find all glands in patients with known or suspected MEN1. Experts disagree, however, about the optimum extent of the subtotal parathyroidectomy procedure. Some favor a more extensive procedure to reduce the risk of recurrent disease, while others favor a less extensive procedure to decrease the risk of hypoparathyroidism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most commonly, initial surgery involves removal of three and one-half parathyroid glands (or all but one-half gland, if supernumerary glands are found), together with thymectomy. Surgery is repeated if hypercalcemia and specific indications recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A more aggressive initial surgical approach involves complete parathyroidectomy and placement of a small parathyroid autograft in the muscles of the forearm or neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Recurrent hyperparathyroidism due to growth of the autograft can then be treated by graft removal under local anesthesia. If, however, the autograft does not function, the patient may have permanent hypoparathyroidism.</p><p/><p>There are no randomized trials comparing the two approaches. In a review of 18 reports of 2 to 73 patients with MEN1 followed for 4 to 12 years after subtotal parathyroidectomy (three and one-half glands resected) with or without cervical thymectomy, persistent hyperparathyroidism was reported in 0 to 33 percent, recurrent hyperparathyroidism in 0 to 36 percent, and persistent hypoparathyroidism in 0 to 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the same review, there were 10 reports of 4 to 36 patients with MEN1 who had complete parathyroidectomy with cervical thymectomy and autologous placement of a small parathyroid autograft. After a mean follow-up of 6 to 10 years, persistent hyperparathyroidism was reported in 0 to 3 percent, recurrent hyperparathyroidism in 0 to 55 percent, and hypoparathyroidism in 0 to 46 percent. In these observational studies, the more aggressive approach was associated with lower rates of persistent hyperparathyroidism but higher rates of hypoparathyroidism.</p><p>When performed by a surgeon who has extensive experience in either approach, as surgery for MEN1 patients should be, results are good and complication rates are low. In such instances, the preference of the experienced surgeon should be followed.</p><p>While cervically accessible thymectomy during initial parathyroidectomy in MEN1 is generally recommended, its role continues to be discussed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The clearest rationale for thymectomy relates to the substantial frequency with which intrathymic parathyroid tissue is found as a present or future source of pathologic parathyroid hormone (PTH) production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Since only part of the thymus is accessible cervically, this measure will not completely prevent the future development of thymic carcinoid, a rare but often-aggressive tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Still, we think the presumed benefit of preventing some thymic carcinoids outweighs the potential risk of this procedure in the hands of an expert surgeon, so we generally favor thymectomy in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4445841\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcimimetic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a>) activate the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid gland, thereby inhibiting PTH secretion. Although not typically used in the United States for the treatment of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism, cinacalcet reduces serum calcium in the majority of affected patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-management#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management&quot;, section on 'Calcimimetics'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cinacalcet</a> also appears to decrease the serum calcium concentration in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism due to MEN1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], although the data are limited. In a case report of a patient with MEN1 and recurrent hyperparathyroidism five years after parathyroidectomy, treatment with cinacalcet reduced serum calcium and PTH levels to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. During one year of treatment, levels remained normal. Similarly, in a one-year study of MEN1-associated hyperparathyroidism, cinacalcet reduced serum calcium levels (but not PTH) and was generally well tolerated; bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine and femur (no distal radius data) were unchanged, as was urinary calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, cinacalcet may be beneficial for patients with MEN1 and recurrent symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism who are not candidates for or refuse repeated surgical procedures. However, there are no long-term data evaluating the effect of cinacalcet on clinically important outcomes (eg, bone density, fracture, nephrolithiasis, mortality) in patients with MEN1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PITUITARY ADENOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients with MEN1 have clinically apparent pituitary adenomas. The characteristics of these adenomas in terms of hormonal activity and other features are similar to those in patients with sporadic pituitary adenomas. The most common pituitary adenoma in MEN1 is a lactotroph adenoma, but all other types of adenomas can occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53057\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53057 \">table 1</a>). Multiple pituitary tumors are rarely present in MEN1. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with MEN1 who have pituitary adenomas should be treated in the same way as patients with sporadic adenomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gonadotroph and other clinically nonfunctioning adenomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-therapy-of-cushings-disease-transsphenoidal-surgery-and-pituitary-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary therapy of Cushing's disease: Transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREATIC ISLET CELL/GASTROINTESTINAL TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the efficacy of therapy for hyperparathyroidism and pituitary tumors in patients in MEN1, malignant pancreatic islet cell and gastrointestinal tumors are the primary life-threatening components of the disorder. Endocrine cell tumors at these sites become clinically apparent in approximately one-third of patients with MEN1. However, subclinical involvement is more common; anatomic or intensive biochemical studies reveal evidence of pancreatic tumors in up to 80 percent of patients with MEN1.</p><p>The most common cause of symptoms is the Zollinger-Ellison (gastrinoma) syndrome. Approximately 40 percent of patients with MEN1 have either the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or asymptomatic elevation in serum gastrin concentrations. Symptomatic insulinomas are also fairly common, but tumors that are symptomatic due to secretion of vasoactive-intestinal polypeptide, glucagon, or pancreatic polypeptide are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Zollinger-Ellison syndrome</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2290283\"><span class=\"h3\">General therapeutic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early attempts to treat the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome surgically in patients with MEN1 involved resection of palpable tumors or partial pancreatectomy, but historically, this approach typically failed to cure the hypersecretion of gastrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The recognition that patients with MEN1 often have small, multifocal tumors in the duodenum, not infrequently accompanied by lymph node metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], is consistent with these failures and led to reexamination of the role of surgery. In a controversial area with a dearth of prospective studies to provide guidance, some surgeons are less inclined to operate, while some now regularly operate on MEN1 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome that persists after correction of hyperparathyroidism or if imaged tumors in the pancreaticoduodenal region exceed a certain size threshold (eg, 2 or 3 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. One current approach includes duodenotomy, often preceded by endoscopic ultrasound or accompanied by intraoperative ultrasonography, and subtotal pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>], or even more aggressive resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and can be subject to modification based upon the individual situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Given the impressive efficacy of proton pump blockers in controlling symptoms and the fact that surgery for primary gastrinoma in MEN1 is unlikely to result in cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], the primary benefit to be sought from surgery is a decrease in mortality from metastatic gastrinoma. While results of modern surgical approaches seem promising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/29,31,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,34-36</a>], longer follow-up studies are needed because the likelihood of developing hepatic metastases and death may be low even in unoperated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/24,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31</a>]. Currently, no definitive evidence exists that surgery decreases the mortality of the disease in MEN1 or the likelihood that clinically important metastases will develop, although a nonrandomized study suggests that it may [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2290290\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacologic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical therapy for patients with a MEN1-associated gastrinoma is administration of a proton pump inhibitor, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma)&quot;</a>). When given once or twice daily, these drugs effectively inhibit acid secretion and relieve acid-peptic symptoms in these patients for prolonged periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/27,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,37</a>]. A nine-year prospective study of the safety and efficacy of omeprazole revealed no tachyphylaxis or important toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2290309\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The question of whether or not to recommend duodenal-pancreatic surgery in patients with MEN1 who have pharmacologically controllable Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and no other clinically evident hormonal excess syndrome or imaged tumors is an especially difficult one. Because clinical outcome data are not definitive, we extensively discuss potential advantages and risks of both options with the patient. While we do not strongly advocate for surgery, we do not discourage a patient who wishes to have surgery for MEN1-associated Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, as long as the individual recognizes that solid proof of improved mortality is lacking and the surgeon is experienced and knowledgeable. Furthermore, if such a patient requires abdominal surgery for another reason (such as insulinoma), it seems appropriate to include duodenotomy in the procedure.</p><p>For patients with pharmacologically controlled Zollinger-Ellison who do not have surgery, we monitor symptoms. Imaging studies (computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">[CT]/magnetic</span> resonance imaging [MRI]) are performed as clinically indicated. Clinicians who favor pancreaticoduodenal surgery when a tumor exceeds a certain size threshold may choose to image more regularly, as per published guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, data favoring the use of such specific triggers in improving outcomes (eg, preventing metastases, mortality) are very limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The best course for patients with hepatic metastases is unclear.

Although octreotide has not been demonstrated to prolong survival, it may delay tumor progression; the impact on symptoms is unpredictable. Given the indolent behavior of metastases in many patients and the relative lack of efficacy of most treatments, we tend to observe only and defer surgery or chemotherapy until the situation dictates that some intervention be attempted.

Approximately 4 to 10 percent of patients with insulinomas have MEN1, and in most of them, the MEN1 is known or suspected. Treatment is complicated by the possible presence of multiple insulinomas, the likelihood that preoperative or intraoperative localization techniques may miss small tumors, and the continuing risk for pancreatic tumors after surgery. As a result, some experienced surgeons recommend local excision of any tumors found in the head of the pancreas plus a distal subtotal pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This approach differs from that in patients with sporadic insulinomas, who typically have a solitary tumor and in whom localization and local excision alone are usually successful.

Compared with nonaffected patients, those with thymic tumors and duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine or nonfunctioning tumors had a higher risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Because effective treatment is available for hyperparathyroidism and pituitary disease in MEN1, the malignant potential of pancreatic endocrine tumors and carcinoids are the primary life-threatening manifestations of MEN1. These tumors are often present at initial assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment/abstract/17,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,44</a>]. Whether earlier detection through radiographic screening improves mortality remains uncertain.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-management#H19948260\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management&quot;, section on 'Candidates for surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with MEN1 and indications for parathyroidectomy, we recommend subtotal (three and one-half gland) parathyroidectomy rather than removal of fewer glands (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We generally favor including cervical thymectomy in this setting. Also acceptable is removal of all four glands with cervical thymectomy and autologous transplantation of parathyroid tissue. The choice of procedure depends upon the expertise of the parathyroid surgeon. Surgery should only be performed by surgeons highly experienced in parathyroid surgery. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pituitary adenomas in patients with MEN1 should be treated in the same way as sporadic pituitary adenomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acromegaly&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-therapy-of-cushings-disease-transsphenoidal-surgery-and-pituitary-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary therapy of Cushing's disease: Transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gonadotroph and other clinically nonfunctioning adenomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active Zollinger-Ellison syndrome as part of the MEN1 syndrome should be treated primarily by proton pump therapy to limit the clinical manifestations and complications of peptic ulcer disease. The role of duodenal-pancreatic surgery to prevent metastatic disease is uncertain and controversial but could prove beneficial and requires further study. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Zollinger-Ellison syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma)&quot;, section on 'Medical management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is indicated for patients with MEN1 and insulinoma. Because patients with MEN1 often have additional pancreatic tumors that may include other insulinomas, local excision of any tumors in the head of the pancreas plus a distal subtotal pancreatectomy is frequently performed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Insulinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is reviewed separately.
