Successful resuscitation is more likely if vascular access is achieved within the first few minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The preferred venous access site during pediatric resuscitation is the largest, most accessible vein that does not require the interruption of resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The general approach to vascular access during pediatric resuscitation is provided in the algorithms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114713\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114713 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115150\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115150 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Key principles include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During CPR or the treatment of severe septic shock, intraosseous (IO) cannulation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraosseous-infusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraosseous infusion&quot;</a>) and peripheral venous access should be pursued simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. At the same time, the resuscitation team should also prepare for central venous access by identifying a site with ultrasound and obtaining an appropriate insertion kit and catheter or, in newborns younger than 10 days of age, setting up for an umbilical venous line. The clinician should use the largest catheter that can be placed (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Catheter selection'</a> below). Even when peripheral venous or IO access is achieved, most patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest or who have shock that is <strong>not</strong> fluid responsive will require central venous access to provide long-term and secure venous access for continuous drug administration, to allow for repeated blood sampling, and to permit monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attempts at peripheral and central venous access in the head, neck, and chest should be limited during CPR to avoid interruption of ventilation and chest compressions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When selecting a catheter length and size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78405\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78405 \">table 1</a>), one should recognize that the flow rate through a catheter is directly proportional to the internal diameter of the catheter and inversely proportional to its length. In addition, the resistance to flow decreases by the fourth power of the change in the radius as the radius of the catheter increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Therefore, shorter, larger bore catheters permit more rapid delivery of fluid and are preferred to longer catheters, although specialized catheters designed for placement using ultrasound, such as the micropuncture catheter, have equivalent flow rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of a protocol that sets a time limit for peripheral intravenous line insertion during resuscitation can facilitate the rapid establishment of venous access and has been associated with a significantly shorter time to vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral versus central</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the rapid delivery of isotonic solutions in patients with shock, large bore shorter peripheral catheters are preferred in most cases to central catheters because they can typically be placed more quickly and are shorter. The lower resistance of the shorter peripheral catheters permits a faster flow rate For example, based upon in vitro studies, the mean flow rate by gravity drainage through a peripheral 22 gauge (length 1 inch) catheter is 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> compared to 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> through a 20 gauge (length 5 cm) central catheter. Use of a pressure bag at 300 mmHg increases the rate to 64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> via the peripheral 22 gauge catheter versus 38 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> via the central catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Although peripheral or IO access is recommended instead of central venous access during initial resuscitative efforts, in some situations, access with a larger bore catheter may only be achieved centrally. In addition, central venous access may be more secure than peripheral or IO and permits reliable infusion of irritant drugs (eg, vasoactive agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcium chloride</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a>). Therefore, central venous access should be considered early during resuscitation whenever feasible.</p><p>With respect to drug delivery during cardiopulmonary arrest, although animal models have suggested that central venous drug administration can produce more rapid onset of action and higher peak drug levels than does peripheral venous or IO administration, these differences are not clinically important, especially in pediatric models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Regardless of route, drug delivery is enhanced when the resuscitation drug is followed by a bolus of 5 to 10 mL of normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIPHERAL ACCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral venous catheters are typically the easiest and safest means of achieving vascular access during the initial resuscitation of patients, particularly for clinicians who do not have experience with central venous catheterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common type of peripheral venous catheter used in children is the over-the-needle catheter, typically 22 to 24 gauge in newborns and infants and 18 to 20 gauge for older children. The size of the cannula used in resuscitation should be the largest that can be inserted reliably. In shock or severe hypovolemia, a smaller cannula may be used for initial fluid resuscitation until a larger vein can be cannulated. Butterfly needles should be <strong>avoided</strong> because they infiltrate easily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential sites include the upper and lower extremities, the scalp, and the external jugular vein. Depending on the length and the position of the catheter tip, external jugular venous cannulation also may provide central venous access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Upper extremity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cephalic, basilic, and median cubital veins in the forearm and the dorsal veins of the hand offer a route for rapid drug and fluid delivery in the upper extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50832 \">figure 1</a>). The antecubital vein is relatively easy to cannulate. However, catheters placed in this location must be well secured with an armboard to prevent elbow flexion, which can cause kinking of the catheter as well as infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Any of these sites may be difficult to locate in a well-nourished infant. If peripheral intravenous (IV) access is not rapidly established, then other means of vascular access (ie, intraosseous cannulation or central venous access, depending upon the clinical situation) should be promptly performed. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p>Transillumination of the palm with a high-powered cold light source has been successfully used in infants and young children to locate veins for cannulation in the dorsum of the hand. Similarly, static and dynamic ultrasound has been described for peripheral IV access. However, trials of these techniques in children have not demonstrated any advantage over either transillumination or ultrasound guidance for peripheral IV catheter placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H1232393436\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Use in children'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower extremity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The great saphenous vein at the ankle is the most accessible vein in the lower extremity because of its large size and consistent anatomy. The veins of the dorsal arch can be used also (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70790\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70790 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Scalp</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The small superficial veins of the scalp rarely are useful during CPR but may be helpful in less urgent situations. This location is less desirable because the scalp may have to be shaved to expose the vein, and doing so may cause the parents unnecessary concern about a &quot;needle in the head&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A circumferential tourniquet, such as a rubber band, is placed around the forehead to make the veins visible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75153 \">figure 3</a>). Boluses of fluid may be given via a scalp IV in an attempt to improve circulating volume, making other peripheral venous sites more visible and accessible. Caution must be used when accessing scalp veins because the temporal artery or its branches can be cannulated inadvertently. Cannulation of an artery is indicated by blanching of the proximal scalp when the saline flush is introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">External jugular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external jugular vein is another useful site for vascular access in young children because no adjacent arterial or neural structures are present. However, it cannot be used as a primary site during resuscitation of infants or children with airway compromise or respiratory failure because cannulation of the external jugular vein requires extension and rotation of the neck.</p><p>Cannulation of the external jugular vein usually requires that the infant or child be placed in a 30 degree head-down (Trendelenburg) position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69429\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69429 \">figure 4</a>). The right external jugular vein is preferred for access because it provides a more direct path to the superior vena cava. Cannulation of this vessel is difficult because of its tendency to roll. In addition, short external jugular catheters are easily dislodged and difficult to immobilize, particularly in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Usually over-the-needle catheters are used for peripheral venous access, regardless of the site. Universal precautions should be employed. The techniques for insertion are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 1 &ndash; The extremity to be used is immobilized. The vein is located and stretched. If the antecubital fossa vein is to be cannulated, a soft roll of gauze can be placed behind the elbow to hyperextend it. If the dorsal hand veins are to be cannulated, the hand is held firmly with the wrist flexed. If the dorsal foot veins are to be cannulated, the foot is held firmly with the ankle extended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 2 &ndash; A tourniquet is applied proximal to the vein, and the skin over the vein is cleansed with an antiseptic solution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 3 &ndash; The <span class=\"nowrap\">needle/catheter</span> is inserted with the bevel of the needle facing up. It is advanced slowly into the vein until a flash of blood is seen in the hub.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 4 &ndash; The <span class=\"nowrap\">needle/catheter</span> is advanced a few millimeters to ensure that the catheter is in the vein. The catheter is then advanced over the needle into the vein, which activates a safety feature in which the needle is withdrawn into a protective sheath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 5 &ndash; Free backflow of blood through the catheter suggests that the vein has been successfully cannulated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 6 &ndash; The tourniquet is removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 7 &ndash; The ability to easily flush saline through the catheter with no swelling at the insertion site confirms IV placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 8 &ndash; The catheter is taped firmly in place, and any air in the connecting tubing is evacuated. An infusion set is attached, and a sterile dressing is applied to the insertion site. In a resuscitation situation, fluid boluses may be pushed directly through the connecting tubing by using a three-way stopcock and a large syringe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complication rate associated with peripheral venous catheters is relatively low, and severe complications are infrequent. Complications include hematoma formation, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, thrombosis, phlebitis, pulmonary thromboembolism, infiltration, and skin slough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Medications that are irritating to the veins, such as calcium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a>, potassium, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a>, should be diluted and administered through the largest peripheral vein possible to avoid the development of phlebitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CENTRAL ACCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants and children, central venous catheters are a reliable means for administering large volumes of fluids or potentially irritating solutions. Infiltration rarely occurs when drugs are infused by this route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, central venous catheters can be used to collect blood samples and monitor hemodynamic variables, such as central venous pressure or mixed venous hemoglobin-oxygen saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Finally, careful attention to technique and verification of catheter tip placement are necessary to avoid complications. Ultrasound guidance should be used for placing femoral vein or internal jugular venous catheters whenever the equipment and operator experience are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H1232393761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When choosing a catheter for central venous placement in infants and children, the length must be sufficient to permit secure placement within the vessel and the bore large enough to achieve high flow rates. </p><p>The following table describes various catheters based upon the age and weight of the child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78405\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78405 \">table 1</a>). For short-term access during a pediatric resuscitation, single-, double-, or triple-lumen polyethylene catheters are used most frequently. Polyethylene catheters are not suitable for long-term access because they have a higher rate of infection and thrombosis than do silastic central venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants and children, the three primary sites for central venous access are the femoral vein, subclavian vein, and the internal jugular vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81727 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p>The femoral vein is the site used most frequently by pediatric emergency physicians because it is relatively easy to access, is distant from the major sites of activity during resuscitation, and is associated with a lower rate of complications than are other sites (3.7 versus 7.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The femoral site is less desirable outside the emergency department or the intensive care unit because it is not suitable for long-term access in a mobile patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, it should not be cannulated in patients who have possible interruption of the inferior vena cava (IVC) (eg, trauma, abdominal catastrophe) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Subclavian vein and internal jugular vein cannulation should be performed only by individuals specifically trained in the procedure because the complication rate is significant when cannulation is attempted by inexperienced personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cannulation of the subclavian vein in children has a lower complication rate than cannulation of the internal jugular vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, many pediatric surgeons prefer to use the subclavian vein for central venous access in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Seldinger technique is particularly useful for establishing central vascular access in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71771 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This technique permits the introduction of catheters into the central venous circulation after initial venous entry using a small-gauge, thin-walled needle or an over-the-needle catheter. Once free flow of blood is achieved using the small needle or catheter, a guidewire is threaded through the needle or catheter into the vessel, and the small-gauge needle or catheter is withdrawn over the guidewire while the guidewire is held in place. A larger catheter then is threaded over the guidewire into the vessel, and the guidewire is withdrawn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Femoral vein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The femoral vein is the most commonly accessed site in pediatric resuscitation. The stepwise technique for its cannulation is described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As always, universal precautions should be employed. Ultrasound guidance should be used for this procedure when equipment and operator expertise are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H1232393340\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Femoral vein'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 1 &ndash; The leg is restrained with the hip abducted and in slight external rotation. A towel can be placed under the gluteal muscle to improve exposure of the vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76663\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76663 \">figure 7</a>). The femoral vein lies 0.25 to 0.5 cm medial to the femoral artery in most children. The femoral artery usually lies 1.5 cm below the inguinal ligament. In the patient without a pulse, the location of the femoral artery can be approximated at the point midway between the anterior iliac crest and the symphysis pubis and is easiest to access at a level just distal to the femoral crease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pulsations in the femoral area may originate from the femoral vein or the femoral artery when chest compressions are performed. Needle puncture should be attempted at the point of pulsation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 2 &ndash; A sterile field is established, and the skin is cleansed with a povidone-iodine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a> solution. The area is draped using sterile gloves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 3 &ndash; All the equipment should be checked prior to proceeding with skin puncture. The introducer needle, the central venous catheter, and all connecting tubing are flushed with sterile saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 4 &ndash; The femoral artery is palpated, and the introducer needle is held with a saline-filled syringe attached parallel to the blood vessel and 30 to 45 degrees above the horizontal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71713\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71713 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 5 &ndash; The skin is punctured 0.5 cm medially to the arterial pulsation. Gentle suction is applied to the syringe while advancing the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 6 &ndash; The needle is advanced 1 to 2 mm after the point of initial blood return. Blood return is reassessed before the syringe is disconnected, and a finger is placed over the needle hub to decrease blood loss and prevent entrance of air. The needle should be withdrawn when failure to locate the vein occurs. Adjusting the needle while it is still in the subcutaneous tissue risks lacerating the vein, artery, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 7 &ndash; The guidewire is grasped using the free hand near the end that has a soft straight tip. The guidewire is advanced through the needle, at least several centimeters past the needle tip cephalad into the vein. The guidewire should pass easily; otherwise it usually is not in the lumen of the vein. The guidewire is removed if difficulty occurs, and the needle is repositioned to establish return of blood flow. The wire is then replaced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 8 &ndash; The guidewire is stabilized against the thigh distally with the hand that inserted it. The needle is withdrawn from the vein along the wire. Once the needle has been pulled out enough to expose the wire at the puncture site, the wire is stabilized at the puncture site and the needle is gently pulled off the guidewire, leaving the wire in place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 9 &ndash; Before inserting larger bore catheters, a dilator is advanced over the wire to the skin entry site. Using a scalpel, a nick is made in the skin at the insertion site.

Then it is anchored distally with a clamp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51805\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51805 \">figure 13</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 8 &ndash; A second silk suture is placed around the proximal end of the vein but is left untied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 9 &ndash; A scalpel blade is used to incise the vein while applying gentle traction to the distal tie. This step is accomplished best by inserting the sharp point of the scalpel perpendicular to the long axis of the vein into the upper third of the vessel to produce a vein wall flap halfway through the vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51805\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51805 \">figure 13</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 10 &ndash; The catheter is threaded into the venotomy site. The insertion of the catheter is facilitated by using a small hook to hold up the proximal vein flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The hook can be made by bending the tip of a 22 gauge needle with a hemostat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51805\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51805 \">figure 13</a>). Alternatively, the exposed vein can be catheterized directly with a traditional over-the-needle catheter. This procedure can be performed without tying off the distal end of the vein. The technique is similar to that used for percutaneous venipuncture except that in saphenous venous cut-down, the vein is directly visualized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 11 &ndash; The catheter is advanced into the vein. Running intravenous fluids, while simultaneously advancing the catheter, dilates the vein and may facilitate passage of the catheter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51805\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51805 \">figure 13</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 12 &ndash; The proximal silk suture is tied around the cannulated vein to hold the catheter in place. The catheter is sutured in place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 13 &ndash; The incision site is sutured, and a sterile occlusive dressing is applied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60601 \">figure 14</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of saphenous cutdowns, when performed properly, are rare. They include local bleeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/phlebitis,</span> sensory nerve damage, and inadvertent loss of the catheter into the vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1940487141\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred peripheral venous access site during pediatric resuscitation is the largest, most accessible vein that does not require the interruption of resuscitation. The use of a protocol can facilitate the rapid establishment of venous access. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the rapid delivery of isotonic solutions in patients with shock, large bore shorter peripheral catheters are preferred in most cases to central catheters because they can typically be placed more quickly and are shorter. Although, peripheral or IO access is recommended instead of central venous access during initial resuscitative efforts, in some situations, access with a larger bore catheter may only be achieved centrally. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral versus central'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous catheters provide a reliable means for administering large volumes of fluid or potentially irritating solutions. They also permit monitoring of hemodynamic variables such as central venous pressure or mixed venous hemoglobin-oxygen saturation and reliable collection of blood samples. Ultrasound guidance should be used for placing femoral vein or internal jugular venous catheters whenever the equipment and operator experience is available. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Central access'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H1232393761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The saphenous vein is a reliable site for venous access, even in small infants, and it is sufficiently removed from the region of most activity during CPR. Saphenous venous cutdown is an acceptable alternative means of vascular access if peripheral venous, central venous, and IO cannulation cannot be performed. However, the other techniques are preferred because they are more often successful, have lower infectious complication rates, and take less time. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Venous cutdown'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the resuscitation of newborn infants, emergency umbilical venous access provides a reliable route for emergency medication and fluid administration during resuscitation and may be easier to perform and to maintain than IO cannulation for providers with appropriate experience and training (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115150\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115150 \">algorithm 2</a>).
