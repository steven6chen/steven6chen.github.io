It is associated with approximately one-third of all infant deaths in the United States and accounts for approximately 45 percent of children with cerebral palsy, 35 percent of children with vision impairment, and 25 percent of children with cognitive or hearing impairment.</p><p>Complications of prematurity are the underlying reasons for the higher rate of infant mortality and morbidity in preterm infants compared with full-term infants. The risk of complications increases with increasing immaturity. Thus, infants who are extremely preterm (EPT), born at or before 25 weeks of gestation, have the highest mortality rate (approximately 50 percent) and if they survive, are at the greatest risk for severe impairment.</p><p>Complications of the preterm infant are divided into short-term complications (eg, respiratory and cardiovascular complications), which occur in the neonatal period, and long-term sequelae (eg, neurodevelopmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy) in patients who survive and are discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In this cohort, there were 2034 live births (60 percent of total cohort), of which 1668 (83 percent of live births) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and, in 189 cases (9 percent of live births), active stabilization was withheld in the delivery room. The survival to discharge for all live births was 51 percent, and the survival for infants admitted to ICU was 62 percent.

As an example, initiation of continuous positive airway pressure or the early administration of surfactant in very preterm (VPT) infants can reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most VLBW infants need resuscitation at birth. Among VLBW infants born in centers of the NICHD Neonatal Research Network between 1995 and 1996, 60 percent required endotracheal intubation, and 7 percent received resuscitation medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The smallest infants were most likely to be depressed and require intervention. Apgar scores &le;3 at five minutes occurred in 27 percent of infants with birth weight (BW) 501 to 750 g, compared with 3 percent of infants weighing 1251 to 1500 g.</p><p>For these reasons, anticipated delivery of a preterm infant should be attended by a clinician experienced in neonatal resuscitation. Facilities for assessment and stabilization should be close to the delivery area, and monitors and resuscitation equipment must be readily available. Resuscitation should follow established guidelines, including special considerations for prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Thus, knowledge of the GA enables an assessment of the chance of survival and the likelihood of developing short-term complications.

Hypothermia may contribute to metabolic disorders such as hypoglycemia or acidosis. </p><p>Preterm infants are at greatest risk for hypothermia immediately after birth in the delivery room and on admission to NICU. This was illustrated in a multicenter study from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network that reviewed the body temperature of moderate (gestational age 29 to 33 weeks) and extremely preterm (EPT) infants (gestational age &lt;29 weeks) admitted to between 2012 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

There also was a threefold increase in the percentage of EPT infants with admission temperatures &gt;37.5&deg;C (6 versus 2 percent), likely due to the implementation of preventive hypothermic measures.

As a result, therapy was not associated with better in-hospital outcomes for any of the 15 definitions used for low BP.</p><p>Long-term data that examine the effect of low BP on neurodevelopmental outcome have conflicting results, as demonstrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one retrospective study of infants born between 23 and 25 weeks gestation, survivors who had low BP (defined as &ge;3 measurements of mean arterial BP &le;25 mmHg in the first 72 hours of life) compared with those with normal BP were more likely to have poor neurodevelopment outcome at 18 to 22 months PMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The use of vasopressor therapy was lower for infants with lower cortisol values at baseline. In contrast, severe IVH was more frequent in infants with cortisol values in the upper quartile at baseline. In addition, infants with baseline values that were greater than the 90th percentile had a higher risk of death, severe IVH, periventricular leukomalacia, gastrointestinal perforation, and severe retinopathy of prematurity than infants in the middle quartiles. Of note, there was no predictable change in cortisol levels based upon treatment with hydrocortisone or placebo. Patients who remained in the upper quartile at days 5 to 7 regardless of treatment group were more likely to have an adverse outcome, especially severe IVH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>These findings underscore the uncertainty of whether or not systemic steroids should be used in settings of hypotension, because it is not clear if they are of benefit, and there is a possibility of adverse effects such as intestinal perforation and long-term poor neurodevelopment outcome (eg, cerebral palsy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].
