These toxicities can limit the maximum tolerated dose of RT and chemotherapy and thus may limit the efficacy of treatment.</p><p>This topic will review the adverse effects of RT on the gastrointestinal tract. A more detailed discussion of the indications for RT for specific cancer sites and stages can be found in topic reviews for each cancer site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102084414\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT can be associated with side effects that can occur at any time during treatment or even years later. For purposes of this topic review, we will adopt the following definitions of these toxicities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute toxicities refer to those with onset during or shortly after the course of treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late toxicities are those occurring after three months after completion of RT. These often reflect the spectrum of radiation tissue changes that can be lasting and irreversible. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ESOPHAGITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3182765280\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal esophageal mucosa undergoes continuous cell turnover and renewal. Acute radiation esophagitis is primarily due to effects on the basal epithelial layer. This causes a thinning of the mucosa, which can progress to denudation. The late effects of radiation therapy (RT) are believed to be due to inflammation and scar formation within the esophageal musculature.</p><p>The radiation dose to the esophagus, technique used for RT administration, the use of concurrent chemotherapy, and the presence of underlying esophageal disease (eg, erosion, gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]) influence the likelihood of esophageal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>These results are illustrated by the following examples (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-chemoradiotherapy-neoadjuvant-approaches-and-postoperative-adjuvant-therapy-for-localized-cancers-of-the-esophagus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy, chemoradiotherapy, neoadjuvant approaches, and postoperative adjuvant therapy for localized cancers of the esophagus&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 91 patients who were treated with high-dose conformal RT, the percentage of esophageal volume and surface area treated to &gt;50 Gy predicted late esophageal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients who had preexisting GERD or esophageal erosion secondary to tumor were at increased risk. Hyperfractionation was associated with increased incidence of acute toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 207 patients who received conformal daily RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy found that a maximal esophageal &quot;point&quot; dose of 69 Gy with RT alone and 58 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy predicted significant esophageal toxicity. Severe toxicity was more common in those receiving concurrent chemotherapy (26 versus 1 percent with RT alone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple trials conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group found that the incidence of severe esophageal toxicity was significantly increased when chemotherapy was given concurrently with hyperfractionated RT, compared with sequential use of chemotherapy followed by RT or with sequential and concurrent chemotherapy with once-daily RT (34 versus 1 and 6 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630600759\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1804891974\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of acute radiation esophagitis include dysphagia, odynophagia, and substernal discomfort. Symptoms usually occur within two to three weeks of initiation of RT. Patients may describe a sudden, sharp, severe chest pain radiating to the back. Acute toxicity rarely causes esophageal perforation or bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2497529480\"><span class=\"h3\">Late</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late effects may be seen within three months of completion of RT, with a median time to onset of six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Patients often present with dysphagia secondary to stricture or altered motility caused by <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/muscular</span> damage or nerve injury or odynophagia due to chronic ulceration. Rarely patients may develop a tracheoesophageal fistula and present with dyspnea secondary to aspiration pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860087040\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of radiation esophagitis is suspected in patients with dysphagia or odynophagia and a history of RT. Upper endoscopy and biopsy serve to establish the diagnosis and rule out other etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H340138448\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper endoscopy</strong> &ndash; Patients with acute radiation esophagitis may have mucositis and ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After completion of treatment, basal proliferation and regeneration occur, usually within three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In patients with late radiation esophagitis, esophageal strictures or ulcerations may be seen. Histologic findings include epithelial thickening, chronic inflammation, and submucosal or muscularis fibrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging</strong> &ndash; We consider performing a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow in patients with a suspected esophageal stricture. Barium swallow can establish the location, length, and number of strictures, determine the diameter of the esophageal lumen, and look for associated pathology such as esophageal diverticula or a hiatal hernia. This information is used to select the dilating technique, to determine the number of sessions that will be required to relieve symptoms, and to counsel the patient about the expected risks of dilation. Barium swallow may demonstrate disrupted peristalsis, with repetitive, nonperistaltic waves above and below the irradiated segment of the esophagus. Evidence of abnormal peristalsis may be observed as early as one to three months after completion of treatment. Alternatively, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can be considered directly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340138448\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of radiation esophagitis includes infectious esophagitis in patients with acute radiation esophagitis and malignancy in patients with late onset of dysphagia. Other causes of dysphagia are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80528 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-oropharyngeal-and-esophageal-candidiasis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis&quot;, section on 'Esophageal candidiasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute esophagitis</strong> &ndash; Acute esophagitis is managed symptomatically. Although interruption of RT is occasionally necessary because of severe symptoms, this approach may compromise treatment efficacy and should be avoided whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Management measures in patients with dysphagia or odynophagia due to esophagitis or esophageal ulceration include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Topical anesthetics (viscous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>), analgesics (anti-inflammatory agents, narcotics), and antisecretory therapy (proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor blockers).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dietary modification (bland, pureed, or soft foods, soups) to help a patient maintain adequate caloric and liquid intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Eating more frequent, smaller meals and avoiding foods that are very hot or very cold may also be useful. Avoidance of smoking, alcohol, coffee, spicy or acidic foods or liquids, chips, crackers, and fatty and indigestible foods can be helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Esophageal strictures</strong> &ndash; Esophageal strictures are generally managed with endoscopic dilation. This approach usually results in symptomatic improvement, although multiple dilations may be required. Extended use of proton pump inhibitors following dilation may decrease the risk of stricture recurrence. Tube feedings are only rarely required for patients with significant weight loss or those able to ingest only liquids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of benign esophageal strictures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dilation of a stricture can cause esophageal rupture, and this approach should be used with caution. Surgical intervention may be required for patients who develop a perforation or fistula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of endoscopic esophageal stricture dilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTRITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2941323550\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irradiation of the stomach as a consequence of treatment of a range of tumors can cause early <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed toxicity. Low doses of radiation therapy (RT) can cause a decrease in gastric acid production, coagulation necrosis of chief and parietal cells, mucosal thinning, edema, and chronic inflammatory infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. Acute ulceration results from desquamation and erosion of the damaged mucosa. </p><p>Risk factors for gastritis include the radiation dose and use of concurrent chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation dose</strong> &ndash; The <span class=\"nowrap\">TD5/5</span> (the dose at which 5 percent of patients develop complications at five years) when the entire stomach is irradiated is estimated to be 50 Gy. The risk of late effects appears to be increased when larger dose fractions are used or when the patient has had prior abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Concurrent chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; Concurrent chemotherapy decreases the tolerance of the gastric mucosa to radiation. Acute gastric side effects are increased when RT is given with taxanes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, and epidermal growth factor or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although 5-fluorouracil is a radiation sensitizer, it has been given with RT at doses of 45 to 50 Gy without substantial increases in toxicity. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nausea and vomiting may occur within 24 hours after the start of treatment. Approximately one-half of patients receiving upper abdominal irradiation will experience emesis within two to three weeks of the start of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other early effects of gastric irradiation include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, anorexia, abdominal pain, and malaise. Symptoms generally resolve within one to two weeks following completion of RT. These symptoms may be accompanied by development of acute ulceration, occurring shortly after completion of RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Late</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may present with abdominal pain. These symptoms may be due to nonulcer dyspepsia, late gastric ulceration (which usually occurs five months after irradiation), or antral stenosis (which can occur 1 to 12 months after irradiation). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3267715313\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of radiation gastritis is often made in patients with mild symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain during or shortly after RT. However, in patients with severe or late (&gt;3 months after RT) symptoms, we perform an upper endoscopy to establish the diagnosis and rule out other etiologies. Endoscopic findings of radiation gastritis include mucosal erosions, ulceration, mucosal atrophy, and antral stenosis. The diagnosis and evaluation of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with nausea and vomiting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2962372396\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis in patients with acute onset of nausea and vomiting includes acute gastroenteritis.

These may be helpful on a long-term basis to avoid late ulceration. Patients with severe pain may require narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics as needed. In rare instances, surgery is required to treat severe bleeding, refractory ulceration, gastric outlet obstruction, fistula formation, or perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ENTERITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) can cause an acute injury to the small and large intestines that develops during or shortly after treatment of a variety of malignancies. The initial toxicity generally resolves within a matter of weeks, but chronic changes can develop months or years after therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gastrointestinal epithelium has a high proliferative rate, making it susceptible to injury from both radiation and chemotherapy. The primary effect of radiation is on mucosal stem cells within the crypts of Lieberk&uuml;hn. Stem cell damage, either acutely as a direct consequence of radiation or subsequently as a result of microvascular damage, leads to a decrease in cellular reserves for the intestinal villi. This results in mucosal denudation with associated intestinal inflammation, edema, shortened villi, and decreased absorptive area.</p><p>The initial histologic evidence of damage is seen within hours of irradiation. This is followed by an infiltration of leukocytes with crypt abscess formation within two to four weeks; ulceration may also occur. Subsequent changes include a progressive occlusive vasculitis with foam cell invasion of the intima and hyaline thickening of the arteriolar walls, as well as collagen deposition and fibrosis, often in the submucosal layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The small bowel becomes thickened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The vessel walls of small arterioles are obliterated, causing ischemia. Lymphatic damage results in constriction of the lymphatic channels, which contributes to mucosal edema and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The mucosa is atrophied, with atypical hyperplastic glands and intestinal wall fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Telangiectasias may be present and can cause bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argon-plasma-coagulation-in-the-management-of-gastrointestinal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Argon plasma coagulation in the management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mucosal ulcerations can lead to perforation, fistulas, or abscess formation. As the ulcers heal, there can be fibrosis with narrowing of the intestinal lumen and stricture formation or even obstruction. Stasis can lead to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Even if the intestine appears normal, patients are at risk of spontaneous perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>These chronic changes can impair absorption of fats, carbohydrates, protein, bile salts, and vitamin B12, leading to loss of water, electrolytes, and protein in the small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Lactose degradation may be impaired, which can lead to increased bacterial fermentation and associated flatulence, abdominal distention, and diarrhea, possibly accompanied by bacterial overgrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There is also evidence of altered gut motility acutely following RT. Bile salt resorption may be impaired, causing increased amounts of conjugated bile salts to enter the colon. These bile salts are then deconjugated by bacteria, resulting in intraluminal water retention with resultant diarrhea. The large intestine is generally believed to be less radiosensitive than the small intestine. When radiation injury does involve the colon, patients can develop a pancolitis that mimics inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2740575947\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors can affect the risk of developing radiation enteritis, including the dose of radiation to the intestines and the use of concomitant chemotherapy. There is some evidence that patients who develop acute intestinal toxicity are at increased risk for chronic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dose and schedule of RT</strong> &ndash; The total RT dose, fraction size, treatment duration, and volume of intestine within the RT field all influence the likelihood of enterotoxicity. The radiation dose at which 5 percent of patients will develop complications at five years <span class=\"nowrap\">(TD5/5)</span> for limited volumes of small bowel is estimated to be 50 Gy. Significant intestinal toxicity is rare when treatment is limited to 45 to 50 Gy in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy daily fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; Combining chemotherapy with RT increases the risk of radiation enteritis. Several studies in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer have found a strong correlation between acute toxicity and the amount of small bowel irradiated at each dose level analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Limiting the volume of small bowel receiving &gt;15 Gy in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy may decrease the occurrence of severe diarrhea and improve treatment tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Data from phase I and II studies suggest that integration of agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, and EGFR inhibitors with RT may significantly increase the frequency of severe gastrointestinal toxicity as compared with 5-FU-based regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other risk factors</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Limited bowel mobility</strong> &ndash; Factors that limit bowel mobility within the abdomen increase the amount of radiation delivered to a specific segment of the intestines. This increased focal irradiation can cause increased toxicity. Bowel mobility may be decreased in the following groups of patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Women, older patients, and thin patients have more small bowel in the pelvic cul-de-sac [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Prior abdominal or pelvic surgery, which can cause adhesions that limit intestinal mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Previous pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis that may result in scarring and decreased bowel mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Vascular disease</strong> &ndash; Patients with preexisting vascular disease due to diabetes, hypertension, or atherosclerosis are at increased risk for radiation enteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The pretreatment abnormalities are exacerbated by the pathologic changes of chronic radiation injury, which include vasculitis obliterans and ischemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Collagen vascular disease </strong>&ndash; Patients with collagen vascular disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis) have a lower gastrointestinal tolerance to radiation and an increased risk of acute and chronic radiation-induced injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. The late effects induced by RT can be additive to these preexisting changes that include transmural fibrosis, collagen deposition, and inflammatory infiltration of the mucosa.

Radiation hepatitis is manifested by venoocclusive disease with central vein thrombosis at the lobular level.

Acute radiation hepatitis can be fatal, and hepatic toxicity can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. </p><p>Fibrin deposition in the central veins is thought to be the cause of the venoocclusive injury. The etiology of the fibrin deposition is unknown. Tumor growth factor-beta is increased during exposure to radiation, which may stimulate fibroblast migration to the site of injury, causing fibrin and collagen deposition. Foci of necrosis are found in the affected portion of the lobules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].
