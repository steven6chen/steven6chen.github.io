Many of these symptoms are related to physiologic changes resulting from exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Physiologic changes include alterations in enteric nervous system activity, circulating gut hormone levels, intestinal blood flow, nutrient and electrolyte absorption, intestinal secretion, and motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic review will discuss the most frequently observed gastrointestinal disorders that occur in athletes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1198591525\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of exercise-induced gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms range from 20 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/3-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-10</a>]. The incidence is higher in women and in younger athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Exercise-related gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently associated with consumption of a meal within two to three hours of exercising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/3,5,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,11-14</a>]. Dehydration and analgesic use are associated with a higher incidence of GI symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. While some studies have found an association between the intensity of the exercise and the incidence of GI symptoms, results have been inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/3,5,12,13,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,12,13,17,18</a>]. </p><p>GI symptoms vary with the type of exercise. In general, long-distance runners have a high incidence of lower GI symptoms (eg, fecal urgency, diarrhea, rectal bleeding), and transient abdominal pain. Cyclists have a high incidence of upper GI symptoms (eg, regurgitation, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/3,5,12,14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,12,14,19</a>].

ETAP occurs most frequently during long-distance running but has also been associated with other sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The incidence is higher in younger individuals and following recent ingestion of food and hypertonic fluids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> &ndash; Proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms include diaphragmatic ischemia, jolting stress on subdiaphragmatic ligaments supporting the abdominal viscera, and frictional irritation of the parietal peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25</a>]. Distension of the stomach and gut by food ingestion or repetitive movement of the torso can exacerbate peritoneal irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical</strong> <strong>manifestations and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; ETAP is often described as a sharp or stabbing pain, cramping, aching, or pulling in the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The pain is usually well-localized to the right (46 percent) and left (23 percent) subcostal regions but can occur in other parts of the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A presumptive diagnosis of ETAP can be made in patients with transient, mild, well-localized abdominal pain that occurs in the setting of exercise and is relieved with cessation of physical activity. Patients with severe abdominal pain or persistent abdominal pain after cessation of exercise require evaluation for other causes of abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management and prevention </strong>&ndash; Cessation of exercise remains the most effective means of relieving ETAP. Other physical maneuvers that have demonstrated some efficacy in small studies, including modified expiration through pursed lips after deep inhalation, wearing a tightened abdominal belt, contraction of abdominal muscles by leaning forward while running, and pushing on the site of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/22,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28</a>]. General measures to prevent ETAP include avoidance of food and fluid intake at least two hours prior to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/5,13,22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,22,25</a>]. Patients with ETAP should be advised to consume frequent, small volumes of hypotonic fluids during exercise. Hypertonic solutions (eg, reconstituted fruit juices) should be avoided prior to and during exercise. Physical conditioning and more specifically, improved core stability, may prevent ETAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. However, specific regimens for physical conditioning and core stability have not been examined in clinical trials.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1138310638\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal ischemia</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> &ndash; Exercise-induced intestinal ischemia is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. Mesenteric and colonic ischemia in the setting of exercise is typically nonocclusive. The ischemic segment most often involves the proximal colon but has also been described in the sigmoid colon and ileum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/31,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33,34</a>]. The predilection for right-sided ischemic colitis is due to an increased susceptibility of these end arteries in low-flow states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> &ndash; Exercise-induced intestinal ischemia may be related to a decrease in mesenteric blood flow during exercise, which decreases between 50 and 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. For example, cycling for 60 minutes at 70 percent of capacity by healthy men was associated with reduced intestinal blood flow, leakage of gut-specific enzymes into plasma, and increased intestinal permeability, suggesting mild injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The reduction in splanchnic blood flow may be due to an exercise-induced reduced splanchnic artery diameter or resistive index and may be aggravated by exercise intensity, duration, dehydration, and higher environmental temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, correlation between alterations in physiologic mesenteric blood flow and intestinal ischemia in athletes has not been definitively demonstrated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Patients may present with abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/10,32,33,37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32,33,37,39</a>]. Rectal bleeding or bloody diarrhea usually develops within 24 hours. In contrast to ETAP, pain associated with intestinal ischemia is more severe, is not as well localized, and persists after cessation of exercise. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with ischemic colitis and mesenteric ischemia is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190363859\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonic-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colonic ischemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonocclusive-mesenteric-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management and prevention</strong> &ndash; Most patients with exercise-induced ischemic colitis have complete resolution with supportive care and correction of hypovolemia.

Vigorous exercise can induce GERD in normal subjects especially if exercise is performed within one hour of a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> &ndash; Multiple factors are believed to contribute to the development of reflux in athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These include exercise-induced increase in intra-gastric pressure due to contraction of abdominal musculature; delayed gastric emptying from reduced splanchnic blood flow and hypertonic fluids; impaired secretion of protective factors from the gastrointestinal mucosa; decreased esophageal clearance from a reduction in the duration, frequency, and intensity of esophageal contraction; and an increase in the number of lower esophageal sphincter relaxations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/41,45,46,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,45,46,48,49</a>]. In one study, treatment of athletes with GERD symptoms with a proton pump inhibitor decreased exercise-induced acid reflux but did not significantly alter GERD symptoms, supporting the multifactorial etiology of reflux in athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Symptoms of GERD include heartburn, regurgitation, and chest pain.

Approximately 2 to 6 percent of athletes report vomiting. However, under extreme conditions, the incidence of nausea and vomiting is higher. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathogenesis </strong>&ndash; The etiology of exercise-induced nausea and vomiting may be similar to that of reflux in athletes, with exercise-induced delayed gastric emptying and altered intestinal motility contributing to symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Although gastric acidity is not significantly altered with exercise, increase in gastric bile acid levels may contribute to nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Endotoxemia and compromised intestinal barrier function has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of nausea and may be increased following ingestion of carbohydrates during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Exercise-induced nausea and vomiting typically occur during or shortly after exercise.

In an illustrative study that evaluated 41 runners competing in a marathon, nine (21 percent) developed post-race fecal occult blood of whom seven underwent upper endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Of the three patients who were evaluated within 48 hours, two had bleeding antral erosions, and one had hyperemia and erosions isolated to the splenic flexure on colonoscopy. In the four runners with delayed endoscopic procedures, no source of bleeding was found. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Anemia is rare in athletes and is usually multifactorial (eg, intravascular mechanical hemolysis, volume expansion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/82-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-92</a>]. The evaluation of patients with occult and overt gastrointestinal bleeding are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H2603283601\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Athletes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>prevention</strong> &ndash; Prophylactic acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor may be effective in preventing occult gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastric erosions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. However, the need for such prophylaxis is unclear, since most lesions associated with occult blood loss are transient and clinical sequelae are rare. The management of gastrointestinal bleeding and ischemic colitis is similar to the general population and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonic-ischemia#H1337502386\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colonic ischemia&quot;, section on 'Ongoing monitoring and counseling'</a> and <a href=\"#H1138310638\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal ischemia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of exercise-related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms ranges from 20 to 96 percent. Many of these symptoms are related to physiologic changes resulting from exercise. The incidence is higher in women and in younger athletes. Risk factors include dehydration and analgesic use. Exercise-related GI symptoms are frequently associated with consumption of a meal two to three hours prior to exercise. (See <a href=\"#H1198591525\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise-related transient abdominal pain (ETAP) occurs in up to 68 percent of athletes. The pain is usually well localized to the subcostal regions and is relieved with cessation of physical activity. In patients with bothersome symptoms, we suggest the avoidance of high-calorie and high-fat meals and fluids at least three hours before exercising (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with ETAP should be advised to consume frequent, small volumes of hypotonic fluids during exercise. In patients with persistent symptoms, we suggest a temporary decrease in exercise intensity or duration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Exercise-related transient abdominal pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise-induced intestinal ischemia is rare. Mesenteric and colonic ischemia in the setting of exercise is typically nonocclusive. Symptoms are usually mild and generally resolve without treatment. Patients may be present with abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or vomiting. In patients with ischemic colitis, rectal bleeding or bloody diarrhea usually develops within 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H1138310638\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal ischemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper gastrointestinal symptoms related to exercise include heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. Patients should be advised to avoid high-calorie, fatty meal three hours prior to exercise and hypertonic fluids during exercise. During endurance or intense exercise, carbohydrate intake in the form of liquid supplementation may be better tolerated. The management of patients with persistent reflux symptoms usually requires acid suppression with a histamine 2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Gastroesophageal reflux'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2331330144\" class=\"local\">'Nausea and vomiting'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms include urgency to defecate and diarrhea during exercise. Fecal incontinence is rare. Diarrhea may be provoked by an incomplete bowel movement before starting exercise and pre-race anxiety. Exercise-induced diarrhea is typically self-limited and rarely results in dehydration or electrolyte disturbances. (See <a href=\"#H2216852351\" class=\"local\">'Exercise-induced diarrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal bleeding associated with exercise can result from hemorrhagic gastropathy, erosive gastritis, gastric ulcers, or ischemic colitis. Bleeding is usually occult and lesions are transient. Anemia due to occult blood loss is rare in athletes and if present is usually multifactorial in etiology. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal bleeding'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-related-gastrointestinal-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gil SM, Yazaki E, Evans DF.
