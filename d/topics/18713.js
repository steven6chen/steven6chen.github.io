Severe deficiency of vitamin D causes rickets <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypocalcemia in infants and children and osteomalacia in adults or adolescents after epiphysial closure; severe vitamin D deficiency may also be associated with hypocalcemia, which may cause tetany or seizures. These disorders occur with the highest frequency among children in malnourished populations and in children with chronic illnesses. Rickets also occurs in children in developed nations if sufficient vitamin D intake is not ensured through the use of supplements and fortified foods, particularly if exposure to sunlight is limited. The clinical evaluation and treatment of a child with rickets is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rickets-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of rickets in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and treatment of calcipenic rickets in children&quot;, section on 'Nutritional rickets'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical consequences of mild vitamin D deficiency are less well established. However, chronically low vitamin D levels are associated with the development of low bone mineral density and other measures of reduced bone health, even in the absence of rickets. The definition, causes, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency in children, and the treatment of vitamin D deficiency in the absence of rickets will be reviewed here.</p><p>The causes and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in adults are discussed in separate topic reviews.

Less than 10 percent of vitamin D comes from dietary sources in the absence of food fortification or use of supplements. The prohormone is then converted to the metabolically active form in the liver and kidneys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65360 \">figure 1</a>).

It is formed when ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (wavelength 290 to 315 nm) converts 7-dehydrocholesterol in epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts to pre-vitamin D, which subsequently isomerizes to vitamin D3. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ergocalciferol</strong>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d2-ergocalciferol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin D2</a>, is the form of vitamin D found in plant dietary sources and in most vitamin D supplements.

It is formed in the liver after vitamin D (cholecalciferol produced in the skin or ingested, or ergocalciferol ingested) is bound to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and transported to the liver, where it undergoes 25-hydroxylation to 25(OH)D.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcitriol</strong> (1,25-hydroxyvitamin D or 1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D), is the active form of vitamin D. It is formed in the kidney, after 25(OH)D undergoes 1-alpha-hydroxylation to form 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D. This process is driven by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other mediators, including hypophosphatemia and growth hormone. There are many sites of 1-alpha-hydroxylation, including lymph nodes, placenta, colon, breasts, osteoblasts, alveolar macrophages, activated macrophages, and keratinocytes, suggesting an autocrine-paracrine role for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23366564\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D deficiency in children in the United States and several other developed nations has been reported with increasing frequency since the mid-1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In the United States, the overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (defined in these studies as 25(OH)D &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> in the pediatric age range is about 15 percent, according to large population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

However, the prevalence varies considerably among different countries and subpopulations because of differences in risk factors. </p><p>Populations at increased risk include exclusively breastfed infants, particularly when the mothers were vitamin D deficient during pregnancy, dark-skinned children, those living at higher latitudes, and those with limited sun exposure for a multitude of reasons. (See <a href=\"#H23365759\" class=\"local\">'Causes of vitamin D deficiency'</a> below.).</p><p>1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is an important mediator of active calcium absorption from the intestine, and deficiency of vitamin D causes rickets (and osteomalacia) in growing children and osteomalacia in older adolescents and adults. </p><p>Epidemiological studies suggest possible associations between vitamin D deficiency and a variety of conditions, but a causal relationship has not been established and the mechanism for the associations are not clear. These include certain immunological conditions such as multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], as well as mood disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and cancers such as breast, prostate, and colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>].

This is inadequate data to determine whether vitamin D below a specific threshold causes significant biochemical alterations (such as in PTH or calcium levels) or clinical sequelae (rickets or low bone mineral density), as well as some inconsistency among vitamin D assays. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23366584\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the various forms of vitamin D described above, the level of 25(OH)D is the best indicator of vitamin D status and stores. 25(OH)D is the main circulating form of vitamin D, and has a half-life of two to three weeks. In contrast, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D has a much shorter half-life of about four hours, circulates in much lower concentrations than 25(OH)D, and is susceptible to fluctuations induced by PTH in response to subtle changes in calcium levels. </p><p>The vitamin D assay in use should be able to measure both the D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> derivatives of 25(OH)D, because both derivatives are biologically active after 1-alpha-hydroxylation. The D<sub>3</sub> derivative (from cholecalciferol) is obtained from cutaneous synthesis and most natural dietary animal sources (particularly oil-rich fish such as salmon, mackerel, and herring), as well as some commercially available supplements (multivitamin preparations). The D<sub>2</sub> derivative (from ergocalciferol) is the form in most supplements available for pharmaceutical dosing and from dietary plant sources. Both the D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> forms are used for food fortification. Most commercial laboratories measure both derivatives and report the combined result as the 25(OH)D level, but variability among assays remains an important problem.

As examples, among 500 immigrant children in Scotland during the 1970s, radiographic changes consistent with rickets were found in 32 children (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The mean 25(OH)D level among children with subclinical rickets was 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (21 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> as compared to 16.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (41.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> among patients without radiographic changes, and the positive predictive value of a 25(OH)D level &le;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for rickets was 41 percent. In separate studies in adolescent girls in Finland and boys in Tasmania, 25(OH)D levels less than 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> were associated with elevated markers of bone turnover and reduced bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39,41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41,44</a>]. Thus, there is little evidence from studies in children to indicate that vitamin D levels above the threshold of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> are necessary to optimize calcium absorption or bone density. At this time, we recommend maintaining levels of at least 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> given that some studies have reported elevations in alkaline phosphatase and other bone turnover markers and clinical rickets when 25(OH)D levels are in the 12 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-43</a>]. &#160;</p><p>These cut-offs may need to be revised if future pediatric studies demonstrate benefit of higher 25(OH)D levels. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103524548\"><span class=\"h3\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, thresholds for defining vitamin D status are based on associations with PTH levels, and studies of calcium absorption and bone density. Some controversy exists regarding optimal levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. Many experts suggest maintaining 25(OH)D levels between 20 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 to 72 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> while others suggest maintaining 25(OH)D levels between 30 and 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (75 to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. The controversy about optimal levels is further exacerbated by racial differences in the association between 25(OH)D levels and fracture risks. These racial differences might be attributable to differences in circulating concentrations of vitamin D binding protein, which account for a large proportion of the variation in serum total 25(OH)D levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Defining vitamin D sufficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23365759\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D deficiency is common in infants who are dark skinned and exclusively breastfed beyond three to six months of age, particularly if there are additional risk factors such as maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy or prematurity. Vitamin D deficiency is also common among children who are dark skinned and on vegetarian and unusual diets, use anticonvulsant or antiretroviral medications, or those with malabsorptive conditions. Additional risk factors include residence at higher latitudes, winter season, and other causes of low sun exposure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23365767\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to sunlight, specifically UV-B, is essential for cutaneous vitamin D synthesis, and this is reduced in children with increased skin pigmentation in whom melanin functions as a natural sunblock. More UV-B radiation is present in the midday sun than at other times of the day. During the spring, summer, and fall, 10 to 15 minutes of sun exposure (arms and legs, or hands, arms and face) between 1000 to 1500 hours (10:00 AM and 3:00 PM) is sufficient for adequate vitamin D synthesis in light skinned individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, most Asian Indians require three times as much sun exposure as a light-skinned individual to achieve equivalent vitamin D concentrations, and individuals with very dark skin pigmentation (eg, some with African ancestry) require 6 to 10 times as much exposure as a light-skinned individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,49</a>]. </p><p>The overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among racial groups is generally correlated with differences in skin pigmentation. As examples, in studies from the United Kingdom, the highest prevalence of vitamin D deficiency rickets has been reported in Black children, followed by Asian Indians, and then White children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Data reported in the United States and in Canada are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. One study reported that 36 percent of Black teenagers in Boston, Massachusetts, had 25(OH)D levels of &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/</span> mL (37.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], and other studies have reported that 83 to 91 percent of children with rickets are dark-skinned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,56</a>]. Even in a state such as Georgia, where sun exposure is high, 22 percent of minority children were noted to have 25(OH)D levels of &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/</span> mL (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Proportions were higher in non-Hispanic Black compared with Hispanic children. Data from NHANES (2001-2006) indicate that 92 percent of non-Hispanic Blacks and 80 percent of Hispanics have 25(OH)D levels of &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/</span> mL (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> compared with 59 percent of non-Hispanic Whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Additionally, data from NHANES III indicate that non-Hispanic Black adolescents have 20 times the risk of having 25(OH)D levels of &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/</span> mL (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> compared with non-Hispanic Whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and the risk is higher in females compared with males.</p><p>The latitude of residence and season are also important determinants of cutaneous vitamin D synthesis. During the winter months at high latitudes there is greater scatter and absorption of UV-B because of the oblique angle at which sunlight traverses the atmosphere and its longer path through the atmosphere. As a consequence, beyond a latitude of 40&deg; and during winter, little or no UV-B radiation reaches the surface of the earth. Therefore, while vitamin D deficiency is relatively uncommon at the end of the summer months, it is very common at the end of winter. Even in the summer, use of sunblock can cause a persistence of low vitamin D levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In the Northern hemisphere, vitamin D levels typically reach their nadir in February and March. One study from Iowa (41&deg;N) reported that 25(OH)D levels were less than 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (27.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in 78 percent of unsupplemented breastfed infants during winter, compared to only 1 percent in the summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In Edmonton, Canada (52&deg;N), 34 percent of children presenting to an emergency department at the end of winter had 25(OH)D levels less than 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> and 6 percent had levels less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

This recommendation is based on the low vitamin D content of breast milk, the inconsistency and unpredictability of cutaneous vitamin D synthesis from sun exposure, and the disproportionately high frequency of rickets among exclusively breastfed infants. Supplementation should be continued until the infant is weaned and drinks at least 33 ounces (1 liter) of vitamin D-fortified formula (or vitamin D-fortified cow's milk or fortified plant-based milk, if infant is older than 12 months). Other sources of vitamin D include sunlight and certain solid foods (oily fish, eggs, and fortified foods). However, the intake from these sources tends to be low and inconsistent, so it is best to rely on either supplements or vitamin D-fortified <span class=\"nowrap\">formula/cow's</span> milk to supply vitamin D requirements (see <a href=\"#H28181902\" class=\"local\">'Exclusive breast feeding'</a> above).

Currently, fortification practices in the United States ensure that infant formulas contain 40 to 100 international units of vitamin D per 100 kcal of formula, providing at least 400 international units per liter. Thus, formula-fed infants who consume at least 1 liter (33 oz) of formula daily meet the current AAP standards for vitamin D intake. However, most infants who are only partially formula-fed, and many infants who are fully formula-fed will consume less than this amount of formula, and should therefore receive supplemental vitamin D. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of concern, it appears that few infants in the United States are receiving sufficient vitamin D to meet the AAP recommendations.

In the study cited above, 67 percent of parents indicated that they believed breast milk has all necessary nutrients, and only 3 percent gave supplements to their children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Another study from the United States concluded that only 1 to 13 percent of infants received supplements per AAP recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. In this study, only 5 to 13 percent of breastfed infants, 9 to 14 percent of mixed-fed infants, and 20 to 35 percent of formula fed infants met the 2008 AAP recommendations for intake of Vitamin D supplements. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Awareness of and adherence to national recommendations for vitamin D supplementation also appears to be a problem in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/94-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-97</a>]. Adherence is better in some other countries. In a Canadian study, 74 percent of mothers who exclusively breastfed their infants indicated compliance with Canadian recommendations for vitamin D intake (also 400 international units daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Other reports describe that supplements are given as recommended to 59 percent of breast fed infants in Norway and 64 percent of those in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia</strong> &ndash; Vitamin D supplementation may rarely trigger idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH), which is characterized by hypercalcemia, failure to thrive, vomiting, dehydration, and nephrocalcinosis. The disorder has been attributed to mutations in CYP24A1, which encodes the enzyme responsible for 24-hydroxylation of vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The effect is dose-related, and the disorder is uncommon among infants given standard supplement doses of vitamin D. The risk and speed of developing symptomatic IIH appears to be greater in infants given bolus dosing of vitamin D (eg, 600,000 international units every three months, as has been done in some countries). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The current lack of information about the frequency of CYP24A1 mutations precludes a universal screening recommendation for IIH in infants given standard doses of vitamin D. However, infants should be evaluated for the possibility of IIH if they develop suspicious symptoms or have a family history of hypercalcemia. The first step in the evaluation is to measure serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels. If these levels are elevated (eg, 25(OH)D&gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [72 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L],</span> calcium &gt;the upper limit of normal for age), then vitamin D supplements should be stopped and the infant should be further evaluated for evidence of IIH, which includes suppressed parathyroid hormone, hypercalcuria, and nephrocalcinosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Supplementation to the lactating mother</strong> &ndash; The administration of moderately high doses of vitamin D (4000 to 6400 international units per day) to the lactating mother is another strategy to raise vitamin D levels in exclusively breastfed infants without giving supplements to the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/86,102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,102,103</a>]. This intervention increases the vitamin D content of breast milk to allow sufficient vitamin D intake by the infant. In a randomized trial, equivalent infant vitamin D status was achieved by providing supplements of 6400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> to the lactating mother, compared with supplements of 400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> to the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. There was no evidence of vitamin D toxicity (eg, hypercalcuria) in the mothers who were taking the 6400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/day</span> supplement. Lower vitamin D doses (eg, maternal intake of 1500 to 2400 international units daily during pregnancy and lactation) are generally sufficient to maintain blood levels of vitamin D of &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in the mother and will improve the infant's vitamin D status at birth. However, these doses may not result in sufficient vitamin D in breast milk to meet the infant's needs, and supplementation may still be necessary for the infant. In the randomized trial above, supplements of 2400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> given to lactating mothers were not sufficient to prevent vitamin D insufficiency in unsupplemented infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

Consumption of at least one liter of fortified formula or beverages daily is usually sufficient to meet at least two-thirds of the current guidelines for daily vitamin D intake (600 international units daily for children one year and older). However, many children do not consume this quantity of fortified beverages and may need supplementation to meet guidelines for vitamin D intake. This is particularly true if juice intake is limited because of its high content of sugar and calories, which have been implicated in the development of childhood obesity.</p><p>Milk is not routinely fortified with vitamin D in many countries outside of the United States. Fortification practices and vitamin D intakes vary widely among European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>], and nearly 45 percent of children and adolescents across Europe have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency (serum 25(OH)D &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. There is ongoing controversy about optimal strategies to address this problem. On the one hand, a supplementation strategy does not reach the entire population because of non-adherence. On the other hand, a milk-fortification strategy does not ensure adequate intake because milk intake tends to vary widely within a population. Several studies have suggested that milk fortification has only modest effects on the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H722963\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D supplementation of pregnant women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To optimize an infant's vitamin D status and bone health at birth, it is important to ensure that the pregnant mother has sufficient vitamin D intake throughout pregnancy. This is because maternal vitamin D crosses the placental barrier and builds up fetal stores of vitamin D, particularly during the third trimester. This is of greater concern in dark skinned women, those living in higher latitudes, and those whose cultural and religious practices include complete skin cover. </p><p>In pregnant and lactating women, the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D is 600 international units daily, which is the same as for women who are not pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, some studies suggest that this intake may not be adequate: One study of pregnant women in Finland found that 71 percent were vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D levels &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> despite an average vitamin D intake of almost 600 international units daily; lower maternal 25(OH)D levels were also associated with some indicators of reduced fetal bone health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].

However, darker skin pigmentation, winter season, or northern latitudes can markedly reduce skin synthesis of vitamin D and increase the need for dietary sources. (See <a href=\"#H23365767\" class=\"local\">'Decreased synthesis'</a> above.)</p><p>The advantage of sun exposure in providing vitamin D needs to be balanced against the potential risk for skin cancer from excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation, particularly melanoma, which is one of the most common forms of cancer among young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. The latter is particularly concerning in light skinned individuals during the summer months, especially if there is a family history of skin cancer. These concerns have led to recommendations that direct sunlight exposure should be avoided for infants younger than six months old, and that sun exposure should be limited in older children, through the use of protective clothing and sunscreen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/117,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,118</a>].

The Global Consensus Recommendations on Prevention and Management of Nutritional Rickets include administration of a daily dose of 500 mg of elemental oral calcium (either dietary or supplemental) with vitamin D treatment, regardless of age or weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>In children with symptomatic hypocalcemia (including seizures or tetany), one or more intravenous boluses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcium gluconate</a> may be necessary, at a dose of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of elemental calcium (maximum single dose 540 mg) administered slowly intravenously over 5 to 10 minutes (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent calcium gluconate), followed by a slow infusion of calcium in patients with persistent hypocalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H23366630\" class=\"local\">'Defining vitamin D sufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p>Based on currently available data, we do not usually give vitamin D replacement therapy to infants or children for low-normal vitamin D levels (25(OH)D between 20 and 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)),</span> unless there are other signs of vitamin D deficiency or important risk factors (eg, very low nutritional intake or perinatal risk factors) (see <a href=\"#H23365759\" class=\"local\">'Causes of vitamin D deficiency'</a> above). However, the diets of such children should be reviewed, and vitamin D supplements should be given as needed to meet current intake recommendations. We also suggest monitoring 25(OH)D levels in these children periodically, and initiating treatment if levels fall below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>.

We generally check serum 25(OH)D levels and other chemistries after six to eight weeks of high-dose therapy, then again after several months of maintenance therapy, then annually thereafter. It is important to monitor 25(OH)D levels to ensure that vitamin D requirements continue to be met after vitamin D deficiency has been treated, particularly in high risk population groups.</p><p>Patients with rickets require close follow-up to document radiographic healing, normalization of serum 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium and phosphorus levels, and long-term maintenance of vitamin D sufficiency. Recovery is associated with an initial increase in serum phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels, followed by a gradual normalization of ALP; PTH; 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D; and 25(OH)D levels.

(See <a href=\"#H23365759\" class=\"local\">'Causes of vitamin D deficiency'</a> above.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants and children with the above risk factors, we suggest laboratory screening for vitamin D deficiency (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Screening is accomplished by measuring 25(OH)D levels. The timing of such screening depends on the underlying risk factor. It could occur at a well child visit for a premature or exclusively breastfed infant not reliably taking at least 400 international units daily, at the time of diagnosis of malabsorption, or during the winter and spring months for dark-skinned children and children living at higher altitudes on vegetarian and unusual diets. In our practice, we typically screen infants at the time that the risk factor is identified, particularly if the infant has not been adequately supplemented to that point. (See <a href=\"#H23365824\" class=\"local\">'Screening for vitamin D deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standards for defining vitamin D status in healthy children are not well established. The most common definitions are (see <a href=\"#H23366630\" class=\"local\">'Defining vitamin D sufficiency'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Vitamin D sufficiency</strong>: 25(OH)D &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Vitamin D insufficiency</strong>: 25(OH)D 12 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Vitamin D deficiency</strong>: 25(OH)D &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (&lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recommended intake for vitamin D is 400 international units daily for infants, beginning soon after birth, and 600 international units for children and adolescents 1 to 18 years of age. High risk groups may have a higher requirement of vitamin D to maintain 25(OH)D levels in the sufficient range. (See <a href=\"#H23365817\" class=\"local\">'Targets for vitamin D intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For exclusively breastfed infants we recommend vitamin D supplementation providing 400 international units daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Infants who are partially formula-fed usually also require supplementation unless their formula intake is &gt;1000 mL (33 oz) daily. Use of supplements in purely breastfeeding neonates and infants may be avoided if maternal intake of vitamin D is 4000 to 6000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span>. Supplementation should be continued until the infant is weaned and drinks at least 33 ounces (1 liter) of vitamin D fortified formula (or fortified cow's milk, if the infant is older than 12 months). Infants who are reliably taking the recommended supplements do not require routine laboratory screening for vitamin D deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H723639\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin D supplementation for infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants and children with 25(OH)D levels below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> we recommend vitamin D repletion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). In our practice, we use a six to twelve week course of vitamin D replacement at doses ranging from 2000 to 6000 international units per day, depending on the degree of deficiency and the age of the individual, followed by maintenance dosing of 400 to 1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span>. Some children may require higher doses. Either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d2-ergocalciferol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin D2</a> (ergocalciferol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin D3</a> (cholecalciferol) may be used. A variety of other dosing schemes are also effective for children older than one year, including use of 50,000 international units, given once weekly for six or more weeks. (See <a href=\"#H16834525\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After treatment for vitamin D deficiency, follow-up laboratory testing is important to verify response and adherence to treatment, and that normal vitamin D levels are sustained on maintenance dosing.
