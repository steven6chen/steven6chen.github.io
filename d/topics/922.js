Elective surgery should be postponed in patients with signs and symptoms of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or active upper respiratory infection; these patients are referred to primary care or pulmonary medicine. The time needed for a patient with COPD to return to baseline after an exacerbation varies, so the duration of postponement is determined on an individual basis. Typically, inhaled bronchodilators (eg, beta-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic agents) and a brief course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy are prescribed, as well as antibiotics, if indicated. (See <a href=\"#H396784802\" class=\"local\">'Preanesthesia consultation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled beta-agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators, as well as inhaled glucocorticoids, are continued in the perioperative period, including the usual dose on the morning of surgery, with resumption shortly after surgery. For elective surgery in patients with COPD who require endotracheal intubation, we administer an inhaled rapid-acting beta-agonist (either two to four puffs from a metered dose inhaler or a nebulizer treatment) within 30 minutes of intubation. Even in urgent or emergency surgery, there is usually time to administer preoperative inhaled bronchodilators. (See <a href=\"#H252377468\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have been taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or its equivalent (eg, 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, or 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>) for more than three weeks, stress-dose glucocorticoids should be administered prior to induction of anesthesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69479 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H97818647\" class=\"local\">'Empiric stress-dose glucocorticoid coverage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consequences of general anesthesia that are of particular concern in patients with COPD include acute bronchoconstriction due to airway manipulation (eg, intubation, suctioning, extubation); respiratory depression and poor cough, even with low-dose sedatives and opioids; dynamic hyperinflation due to breath stacking during controlled ventilation; and atelectasis resulting from reduction in functional residual capacity (FRC). These complications may present with high airway pressures, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, hypotension, or postoperative respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H233731380\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic and surgical factors affecting pulmonary function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) is a reasonable approach to avoid laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in cooperative patients undergoing appropriate surgical procedures. However, sedative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> opioid administration may result in deep sedation with severe hypoventilation or loss of laryngeal airway reflexes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99795\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99795 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H122018493\" class=\"local\">'Monitored anesthesia care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of a regional or general anesthetic technique is guided primarily by the surgical procedure and patient choice. For consenting patients with COPD undergoing appropriate surgical procedures, we suggest a neuraxial anesthetic technique (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Neuraxial anesthesia provides superior postoperative analgesia and decreases the risk of pneumonia and respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H144230942\" class=\"local\">'Neuraxial anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A regional nerve block avoids laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in cooperative patients undergoing appropriate surgical procedures. However, some regional techniques (eg, interscalene or supraclavicular blocks) have a high incidence of phrenic nerve blockade, resulting in hemidiaphragmatic paralysis and reduction in FRC that may not be tolerated by patients with COPD. (See <a href=\"#H144231109\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral nerve blocks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most adult patients prefer intravenous (IV) induction of general anesthesia. We administer an induction agent that attenuates the bronchospastic response to intubation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> or has bronchodilatory properties (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> 0.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> as well as adjuvant medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> to suppress airway reflexes and reduce the incidence of bronchospasm. A neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is also administered to facilitate laryngoscopy. An alternative technique in cooperative patients without contraindications (eg, aspiration risk) is an inhalational induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> or halothane since these agents have pronounced bronchodilatory effects. (See <a href=\"#H85183324\" class=\"local\">'Induction: Choice of anesthetic agents and techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For maintenance of general anesthesia, we select a potent inhalational agent with bronchodilatory properties (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, or halothane) as the primary agent, supplemented with small doses of an opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>) to deepen anesthesia and suppress the cough reflex, as well as a muscle relaxant if necessary to facilitate surgery. However, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) may be required for certain procedures and is a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H406254308\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance: Choice of anesthetic agents and techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use a short- or intermediate-acting NMBA if necessary for the surgical procedure. We monitor the adductor pollicis muscle with peripheral nerve stimulation to ensure complete reversal of blockade at the time of emergence. Residual neuromuscular weakness contributes to upper airway obstruction, diaphragmatic dysfunction, impaired mucociliary clearance, and the need for reintubation. (See <a href=\"#H406254308\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance: Choice of anesthetic agents and techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H406254433\" class=\"local\">'Emergence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use a lung-protective ventilation strategy to avoid further lung hyperinflation and barotrauma. Our strategy includes low tidal volumes (eg, 5 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> predicted body weight), reduced respiratory rate (8 to 10 breaths per minute), long expiratory time (eg, inspiratory-to-expiratory [I:E] ratio of 1:3), plateau pressures &lt;15 to 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, adjusted fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to the lowest level required to maintain oxygen saturation &gt;90 percent, and cautious use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 to 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. (See <a href=\"#H85183455\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchospasm during surgery should be treated promptly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma#H1234674393\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adult patients with asthma&quot;, section on 'Intraoperative bronchospasm'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoventilation occurring in the immediate postoperative period may be due to residual sedation from anesthetic agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weakness caused by NMBAs. Reintubation, atelectasis, pneumonia, and prolonged controlled ventilation may be avoided by initiating noninvasive ventilation (NIV) as soon as the patient has any signs or symptoms of respiratory distress, rather than waiting until there is definitive evidence of respiratory failure.
