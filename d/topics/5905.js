It is also sometimes used to treat other forms of mental illness.</p><p>During ECT, a small amount of electricity (called an &quot;electrical current&quot;) is passed through the brain. The current causes a seizure that affects the whole brain. This causes chemical changes in the brain that relieve severe depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568340\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know ECT is safe?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before giving you ECT, your doctor will make sure ECT is safe for you. He or she will give you an exam, ask you about your medical history, and run tests. For example, you will probably have blood tests and a test called an &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; (ECG) to make sure that your heart is healthy enough for the treatment. These tests will also help the doctor make sure that there is no other medical problem causing your depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568347\"><span class=\"h1\">How many times will I need to be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every person is different, but most people need a total of 6 to 12 treatments. (Some people need fewer. Other people need more.) The treatments usually happen 3 times a week &ndash; Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568354\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do to prepare for each session?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You must not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before each treatment. If you smoke, do not smoke the morning of your treatment, because smoking before the treatment could cause problems during the treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568361\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during the ECT treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before you get the treatment, a doctor or nurse will put a needle into a vein in your arm (called an &quot;IV&quot;). That way, the medical team can easily give you the medicines you need before and during the treatment.</p><p>You will be asleep during the treatment. But the medical team will start getting you ready for treatment while you are still awake. The team will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place devices called &quot;electrodes&quot; on your head, so that they can measure the electrical activity in your brain. To do this, they will use a device called an EEG, or &quot;electroencephalogram.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place electrodes on your chest, so that they can measure the electrical activity in your heart. To do this, they will use a device called an ECG, or &quot;electrocardiogram.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrap a blood pressure cuff around your arm, so that they can check your blood pressure during the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a small device on 1 of your fingers called a &quot;pulse oximeter,&quot; which measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. This will tell them if you are breathing normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you oxygen through a mask or a tube that rests below your nose. You will get oxygen throughout the whole procedure, until you wake up.</p><p/><p>When everything is connected, the medical team will test the ECT machine to make sure that it is set properly for you. Next, a doctor or nurse will give you a medicine that will make you go to sleep for 5 to 10 minutes. When you are asleep, you will get another medicine to relax your muscles. This will keep you from moving during the treatment.</p><p>When your medical team is sure that you are deeply asleep and that your muscles are completely relaxed, they will give you the ECT treatment. You will be asleep, so you won't feel any pain, and you won't feel the current or the seizure. If you could watch yourself getting the treatment, you would see your toes wiggle or other parts of your body move a little &ndash; but not much else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568368\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after the treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When you wake up after treatment, you might feel confused. This is partly due to the medicines you got and partly due to the treatment. In most people, the confusion goes away within an hour. You might also have a headache the day of the treatment, but you can take a pain reliever, if you need it. Other side effects, such as nausea, usually last only for a few hours.</p><p>You might have trouble remembering things while you are in treatment. This memory loss should slowly get better by itself over the course of several weeks. But you might never remember many things that happened to you shortly before, during, or soon after your treatment.</p><p>To help improve your memory, use your brain. Read, ask questions, and follow stories on TV. This is the best way to help your brain get back to normal.</p><p>Because of the way that ECT affects memory, you should avoid making any major decisions until a week or 2 after the ECT treatment is finished. You should also not drive during your course of ECT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568375\"><span class=\"h1\">When will my depression lift?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people start to feel a little better after 1 to 4 treatments. But many do not get the full benefit of ECT until they have more treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568382\"><span class=\"h1\">Does ECT have any risks?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Like any medical procedure, ECT has some risks. In rare cases, ECT can disrupt the heart's rhythm or cause other problems. People who already have heart disease are more likely to have these problems. If you have a heart condition, your doctor will take special care to monitor your heart. He or she will also take other steps to make sure the treatment is as safe as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568509\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bipolar disorder (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression treatment options for children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-manic-depression-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bipolar disorder (manic depression) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
