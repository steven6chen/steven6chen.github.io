Normally, the chest is symmetrical and, in the infant or young child, almost round. The transverse diameter increases with age. When a persistently round, barrel-shaped chest is seen in an older child, the examiner should consider the possibility of an underlying chronic pulmonary disease, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations of pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Respiratory symptoms and signs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The shoulders should be examined, especially in the newborn, for clavicular fractures and foreshortened or absent clavicles. The width of the ribs and length of the sternum should be noted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-birth-injuries#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal birth injuries&quot;, section on 'Clavicle'</a>.)</p><p>Nipple alignment and the distance between nipples should be noted. Accessory nipples along the milk line are a normal variant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86172\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86172 \">picture 1</a>). A shield-like chest with widely spaced nipples can be found in patients with Turner syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91041\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91041 \">picture 2</a>). Widely spaced nipples also may occur in a number of other syndromes, including 9p deletion, fetal hydantoin syndrome, trisomy 8, and trisomy 18, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Poland syndrome, consisting of syndactyly and ipsilateral absence of the sternal head of the pectoralis major muscle, causes an asymmetrical chest wall with an inferiorly placed ipsilateral nipple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chest wall diseases and restrictive physiology&quot;, section on 'Poland syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>A mild degree of pectus excavatum (funnel chest) or pectus carinatum (pigeon breast) is a common finding in an otherwise normal patient. Pectus excavatum frequently becomes accentuated with even mild degrees of airway obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pectus excavatum: Etiology and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pectus-carinatum#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pectus carinatum&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Inspiration normally results in expansion of the chest wall and depression of the diaphragm. In the patient with unilateral pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, or a foreign body lodged in one of the mainstem bronchi, inspiration can cause the diaphragm to rise and the chest wall to collapse on the involved side. Bilateral paradoxical breathing can be seen in patients with neuromuscular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Breasts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast development staging is based upon standards established by Marshall and Tanner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55329 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The range is from no evident breast tissue (stage 1) to complete adult development (stage 5) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 \">picture 3</a>). Infants of either sex often have transient breast tissue enlargement secondary to perinatal maternal estrogen stimulation; this enlargement may remain for several months before spontaneous regression occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;, section on 'Sexual maturity rating (Tanner stages)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast masses in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Neonates and infants'</a>.) </p><p>In a prospective study, palpable breast tissue was measured in 871 Caucasian children (443 boys and 428 girls) over 978 visits between birth and 27 months of age to provide preliminary information about normative values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Palpable breast tissue in girls was larger and persisted longer than in boys. At &gt;10 months of age, 62 percent of girls and 45 percent of boys continued to have palpable breast tissue. At 18 months of age, the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for breast unit size was 2.88 cm<sup>2</sup> in girls and 1 cm<sup>2</sup> in boys. Breast unit size was calculated by 1) taking two measurements of the horizontal and vertical diameters of each breast (in cm); 2) multiplying the mean of the two horizontal measurements by the mean of the two vertical measurements for each breast to yield a breast unit value for each breast; and 3) averaging the right and left breast unit values. Additional studies in other populations are necessary before these threshold values should be used to make clinical decisions.</p><p>Generally no discernible difference in the size and shape of the chest wall occurs between boys and girls younger than the age of eight years.</p><p>Both males and females may experience the development of a firm and often tender-to-touch unilateral or bilateral subareolar nodule sometime in early adolescence. In approximately 66 percent of normal boys, these nodules occur as part of the developmental pattern of adolescent male gynecomastia. They develop as a result of direct testicular secretion of estrogen and the peripheral conversion of prohormones to estrogen. These nodules decrease in size over one to two years, although residual nontender remnants may remain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast masses in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Prepubertal and pubertal children'</a>.)</p><p>Boys can also have true male gynecomastia; the cause is undetermined in most cases. Possible causes include drugs (eg, digitalis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isoniazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cimetidine</a>, phenothiazine, and antidepressants), herbal products (eg, lavender oil and tea tree oil), breast tumors, adrenal and gonadal lesions, gonadal dysgenesis, hyperthyroidism, Klinefelter syndrome, malnutrition, renal disease, and severe liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Whereas gynecomastia is common in infancy and adolescence, prepubertal gynecomastia is extremely unusual and should be considered pathologic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and evaluation of gynecomastia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, the mean age for the start of breast development in girls is between 8.5 and 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious breast development are discussed separately. If the breasts fail to develop by middle to late adolescence, consideration should be given to the possibility of gonadal dysgenesis, adrenal hyperplasia, pituitary dysfunction, or significant malnutrition (anorexia nervosa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of breast tissue development and size is best determined with the patient in the supine position. While the breast area is being examined, the patient's head should be in the midline resting on the palm of the ipsilateral hand. The pattern for examination should be in concentric circles proceeding peripherally from the infraclavicular and axillary areas toward the areola. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast disorders in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Breast examination'</a>.)</p><p>Obese patients may have pseudoprecocious breast area enlargement, in which the areola is small, the nipple is flat, and the breast tissue is soft. This enlargement contrasts with normal breast development in which the areola is large, the nipple is raised, and the surrounding tissue is firm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lungs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observation of the patient's breathing pattern is foremost in examination of the lung. The rate, rhythm, and depth of breathing should be noted. A periodic sigh is normal in everyone. Shallow, rapid breathing can be seen with anatomical defects, pulmonary infection, pleuritic disease, and metabolic disorders. Slow breathing may occur as a result of central nervous system pathology, metabolic disease, and drug effect. Vigorous exercise, a state of anxiety, and metabolic acidosis may cause deep, rapid breathing. A prolonged expiratory phase occurs in patients with an acute exacerbation of reactive airway disease or true asthma. A sleeping infant may have brief periods of rapid breathing alternating with respiratory pauses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Thorough auscultation of lung fields in children sometimes is difficult; successful examination frequently depends upon the age of the child. Fear of the examiner and discomfort from illness generally account for the patient's uncooperative behavior. Some of the anxiety may be alleviated if a caregiver holds the child. An experienced clinician, aware of the difficulty of auscultation of a noncompliant, often screaming child, concentrates on the inspiratory phase, as often little will be gained by trying to listen during the expiratory phase.</p><p>An organized symmetrical approach to auscultation of the lung fields should be used. Sequential auscultatory examination proceeds from one side of the chest to the other, comparing breath sounds in anatomically similar areas. Either the bell or the diaphragm of the stethoscope may be used, depending upon the size of the child; the diaphragm is more appropriate for listening to the lungs of larger patients.</p><p>The sounds produced by breathing may help localize a particular area of involvement or specific pathologic condition. Ordinarily, deep mouth breathing produces clear, soft breath sounds over the lungs. Atypical breath sounds in the form of crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes are heard most often in patients with underlying pulmonary disease. Upper airway congestion in small children often produces coarse sounds that, when transmitted through the larger airways, may give the impression of an underlying lung abnormality. Frequently, coughing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vigorous crying will clear a congested upper airway, helping the clinician distinguish between upper and lower airway sounds.</p><p>In small children, an inspiratory high-pitched stridulous sound with or without significant respiratory distress may be the result of narrowing at or near the larynx or anywhere along the trachea. This condition can be caused by a croup-like illness, anatomical defect, mass lesion, foreign body, or external obstruction. Patients in severe respiratory distress with stridor may have epiglottitis or croup. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epiglottitis-supraglottitis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epiglottitis (supraglottitis): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>When absent or decreased breath sounds are heard over a particular lung area, spoken words may sound muffled or the letter E may sound more like an A (egophony), especially in a child with a segmental or lobar consolidation. Fairly well-localized squeaky crackles during respiration may be caused by a pleural friction rub.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">General appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician may evaluate the heart in older, cooperative patients at any time during the examination; it is best, however, to evaluate the heart in infants and younger children early in the examination. Before cardiac auscultation and palpation are initiated, the examining clinician should devote particular attention to the patient's general appearance. Central and peripheral color, nutritional status, respiratory rate and effort, presence of sweating, and chest contour should be noted. Jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, and evidence of hepatic engorgement suggest right ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpation of the cardiovascular system should begin with the peripheral pulses. The pulse rate, regularity, and degree of fullness should be noted. Palpation can be useful in the diagnosis of valvular lesions, for assessment of ventricular function, and as a source of information about the patient's hemodynamic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rapid pulse may indicate heart failure, arrhythmia, an underlying respiratory problem, anxiety, or agitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H23884780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bounding pulses suggest aortic insufficiency, patent ductus arteriosus, truncus arteriosus, or an arteriovenous malformation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-regurgitation-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortic regurgitation in children&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=truncus-arteriosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Truncus arteriosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An extremely slow pulse rate could mean heart block, a central nervous system problem, or a metabolic abnormality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradycardia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simultaneous palpation of pulses in the upper extremities and then contralateral palpation of pulses in an upper and lower extremity should be done to help determine the presence of a filling defect in an aortic or peripheral artery (eg, coarctation of the aorta). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Palpation of the heart through the chest wall determines the apical impulse and the presence of a heave, tap, or thrill. Because the right ventricle remains dominant in the newborn, a palpable lift, better appreciated with the heel of the hand, is best felt in the area of the left lower sternal border. In a patient with left ventricular hypertrophy, a heave can be detected best with the palm and proximal surfaces of the fingers of the right hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A tap caused by pressure overload is felt near the apex as a well-localized sharp impulse.</p><p>A thrill is a palpable loud murmur of grade IV to VI. Thrills associated with specific cardiac defects often are well localized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur#H14181590\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;, section on 'Palpation of the chest'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auscultation of the heart can be achieved using either the bell or diaphragm of the stethoscope. The bell is designed for listening to low-frequency sounds and the diaphragm for high-frequency sounds. Thorough evaluation necessitates auscultation of all areas of the precordium, as well as the back, neck, and axillary areas. The process includes noting the rate and rhythm and listening for the normal first and second heart sounds. Close attention should be given to detecting ejection clicks, systolic and diastolic murmurs, pericardial friction rubs, extra heart sounds, and diastolic rumbles. Cardiac auscultation and cardiac murmurs in infants and children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur#H14181621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;, section on 'Auscultation of heart sounds and murmurs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-common-causes-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of common causes of cardiac murmurs in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMEN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visualization of a child's abdomen for contour, symmetry, pulsations, peristalsis, peripheral vascular irregularities, and skin markings is performed best in good light with the patient supine and the examiner positioned at the patient's right side. Although often seen after a patient has eaten, abdominal distention noted at other times may indicate abnormal gas-filled loops of bowel, a ruptured viscus, fecal retention, mass lesion, or ascites. A scaphoid abdomen can occur in a patient with upper gastrointestinal obstruction or as a result of starvation. Peristaltic waves may be seen on occasion, but vascular pulsations generally are not visualized. The presence of hyperpigmented or hypopigmented skin lesions can be normal. Usually, vascular lesions other than hemangiomata are not present.</p><p>Abdominal wall protrusions are common. Umbilical hernias frequently are present in the infant, toddler, and younger child, particularly in black children. Most umbilical hernias are uncomplicated, require no surgery, and resolve spontaneously. Diastasis recti and small epigastric hernias, if not readily visible, can be elicited by having the patient raise his or her head off the examining table while lying supine or by having the child tense the abdominal muscles; these hernias do not require surgical correction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Care of the umbilicus and management of umbilical disorders&quot;, section on 'Umbilical hernia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal auscultation often is difficult and unrewarding in the active, uncooperative child but may be of significant benefit in the child experiencing abdominal discomfort. Active bowel sounds often are heard in patients with gastroenteritis and usually are decreased or absent in patients with appendicitis or intestinal obstruction. Stenosis involving the aorta or iliac, femoral, or renal arteries may give rise to an audible abdominal bruit.</p><p>Some examiners have employed an auscultatory technique to determine the inferior margin(s) of the liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spleen by listening with a stethoscope over the patient's abdomen while gently scratching the abdominal skin surface with a blunt instrument. Starting in the ipsilateral lower abdominal quadrant of the organ being examined and advancing superiorly, the examiner is able to identify the lower border of the liver or spleen when a change in sound from tympany to dullness is heard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Percussion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percussion helps detect mass lesions and organ size and often can identify local areas of pain. Solid or fluid-filled structures, such as a urine-filled bladder, produce a dull sound to percussion; gas-filled loops of bowel produce tympany.</p><p>Percussion can be used to help make the diagnosis when a distended abdomen is thought to be the result of ascites. The patient should be supine, and percussion should begin peripherally. At first dullness will be noted. As percussion advances centrally, the air-filled loops of intestine, forced to the midline by ascitic fluid, will emit a tympanitic sound. When the patient turns to one side or the other, the locations of tympany and dullness shift as the fluid moves into dependent areas. A fluid wave can be produced when the examiner strikes one flank area with the tips of the fingers of one hand and detects gentle pressure with the other hand on the opposite flank [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This finding is better demonstrated by employing the aid of an assistant who at the same time has placed the ulnar surfaces of both fully extended hands pointing toward one another along the midline of the abdomen.</p><p>The overall accuracy of the physical examination for the detection of clinically nonobvious ascites was only 58 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-chest-and-abdomen/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The most useful physical finding was flank dullness; if this was not evident (in the hands of an experienced examiner) the probability of ascites being present was less than 10 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpation is extremely beneficial for determining liver, kidney, and spleen size and for detecting abdominal masses. An examiner's warm hands and initial gentle, soft touch may go a long way in gaining the cooperation of the patient for deeper, more thorough palpation. The often-ticklish younger child may require a calm, reassuring touch, and no initial hand movement by the examiner. After a few moments, these children are instructed to take a deep breath and then exhale slowly while the examiner applies firm steady pressure to the abdomen. A fairly complete examination can be achieved by repeating the procedure in all four quadrants.</p><p>The softer and less tense the abdominal musculature, the more easily organs and mass lesions can be felt. For the obese child, a two-hand technique with the fingers of one hand applying pressure on top of the fingers of the other hand may be required. When peritonitis is suspected, rebound tenderness may be elicited by pressing firmly and slowly on the abdomen and then quickly releasing pressure. Subsequent wincing by the patient or other audible or visual signs of pain confirms the examiner's impression.</p><p>Abdominal organs are relatively easy to palpate in children because in general the abdominal wall is thin. The examiner should stand on the patient's right side when attempting to feel the liver, placing the fingers of the right hand over the right middle to lower quadrant in a somewhat oblique position. Palpation should progress in a superior direction until the lower edge of the liver is detected. Alternatively, with the left hand under the right flank applying minimal pressure, the examiner can place gentle, cephalad-directed pressure on the liver until the edge of the liver is felt with the right hand. A similar maneuver in the left upper quadrant and posterior flank helps determine the inferior margin of the spleen.</p><p>The kidneys can be palpated in much the same way as the liver and spleen. Renal tenderness is determined easily in a cooperative child with pyelonephritis through percussion of the flank areas. A firm striking blow with the ulnar surface of the closed fist to the flank area will elicit discomfort in the patient with renal infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H379026962\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the chest wall includes observation of the shape, symmetry, alignment and distance between the nipples, and movement with inspiration and exhalation.
