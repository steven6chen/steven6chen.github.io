The incidence, risks, management, and outcomes of intra-abdominal injuries and complications are described here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12350972\"><span class=\"h2\">Splenic injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The operative risk of splenic injury ranges from 0.4 to 8 percent of colonic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Injury occurs because of the close proximity of the colon to the spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. During mobilization of the splenic flexure of the colon, excessive traction on the peritoneal attachments and omentum can lead to avulsion of a portion of the splenic capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a review of 93,633 colorectal resections from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, splenic flexure mobilization increased the risk of an incidental splenic procedure (odds ratio [OR] 3.59, 95% CI 2.15-4.31) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The risk of incidental splenic procedures was significantly greater for open compared with laparoscopic colorectal resection (OR 6.58, 95% CI 3.59-13.5). Other factors that increase the risk for iatrogenic splenic injury include previous abdominal surgery, midline incision, obesity, and advanced age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>Management of an intraoperative splenic injury includes splenic salvage (primary repair, splenorrhaphy) or splenectomy. Splenic salvage should be the first maneuver to control bleeding and a splenectomy reserved for cases when bleeding cannot be controlled by the previously described techniques. However, in a retrospective review of 975,825 patients undergoing a colorectal resection between 2006 and 2008, a splenectomy was performed for approximately 85 percent of patients (7963 of 9367) with a splenic injury rather than using a conservative splenic salvage procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a single institution review of 13,897 colectomies with 59 splenic injuries, the most common methods of initially managing splenic injuries included hemostatic agents (31 patients), packing (12), electrocautery (8), and suture ligatures (7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Multiple attempts at splenic salvage occurred in 30 patients, and 21 patients (36 percent of total splenic injuries) required a splenectomy. The 30-day major morbidity and mortality rates were 34 and 17 percent, respectively, with sepsis being the most frequent complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The initial and final management of the splenic injury was not associated with short-term adverse outcomes.

In a retrospective review of 50,000 colorectal cancer cases requiring 241 splenectomies from the California Cancer Registry, splenectomy significantly increased the length of hospital stay (13 versus 8 days) and the probability of death by 40 percent compared with cancer patients who did not require splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The prevention of sepsis and the management of sepsis in the asplenic patient are discussed elsewhere.

A primary repair should not compromise the duodenal lumen. If a primary repair cannot be safely performed, a duodenal to jejunal anastomosis is performed.</p><p/><p>A variety of complications can occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An unrecognized enterotomy can lead to peritonitis in the first few postoperative days, necessitating prompt surgical intervention.

Pancreatic injuries are avoided by adequate mobilization of the spleen and ligating the splenic vessels close to the splenic parenchyma. A pancreatic injury can also occur while repairing a splenic injury that may be induced during mobilization of the left colon; if such an injury is suspected, a closed drain should be placed.

The preventive SSI bundle consists of existing evidence-based measures such as mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics, antibiotic prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a>, preparation of the surgical field with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, maintenance of euglycemia, and maintenance of normothermia during the perioperative period. It also includes common sense measures that have not been studied in randomized trials, such as gown and glove change before fascial closure, and daily washings of incisions with chlorhexidine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Further studies are required before all measures contained in the preventive SSI bundle can be recommended for colorectal surgeries. </p><p>In addition to the measures included in the preventive SSI bundle, the choice of surgical dressing may also affect the incidence of SSIs. As an example, a randomized trial involving 147 patients undergoing elective open colorectal surgery for colorectal cancer compared the efficacy of three different dressings in preventing SSIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

An intra-abdominal SSI can be treated by percutaneous catheter drainage or operative drainage. A multicenter prospective study was conducted to determine the success rate of percutaneous catheter drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess in 96 patients, 27 of whom had an abscess following colorectal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Twenty-one of the 27 colorectal surgery patients (78 percent) had complete resolution of the abscess after a single attempt at percutaneous catheter drainage. Patients who failed catheter drainage were managed by an open, operative procedure. Treatment for incisional SSIs is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-abdominal-surgical-incisions#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of abdominal surgical incisions&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Perioperative mortality rates are significantly higher in patients with an intra-abdominal abscess following colorectal surgery. This was illustrated in a retrospective review of 428 patients undergoing an open or laparoscopic colorectal procedure in which the perioperative mortality for patients with an intra-abdominal abscess was significantly higher than in patients without an intra-abdominal infection (19 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Inflammatory peritoneal adhesions account for the majority of cases. In a prospective study of 1002 patients who underwent open colorectal surgery, development of an early postoperative SBO was found to be an independent risk factor for the development of subsequent adhesive SBO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Immediate reoperation for early postoperative SBO should be avoided because of both the high rate of spontaneous resolution and the intense inflammatory response within the abdominal cavity in the perioperative period (from 10 days to 6 weeks). Indications for surgery should be limited to unresolved obstruction after prolonged nasogastric tube drainage, high grade SBO, or suspected ischemic small bowel. </p><p>In contrast to the approach following open surgery, early small bowel obstruction following laparoscopic surgery usually requires early operative intervention.

The infertility rate for women with inflammatory bowel disease prior to surgery is similar to that of the general population (less than 10 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility&quot;, section on 'Prevalence of infertility'</a>.) </p><p>The rate of infertility following a restorative proctocolectomy is significantly increased, ranging in different studies from 26 to 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/71,80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,80-82</a>]. The cause of the increase in infertility is most likely mechanical, including fallopian tube occlusion and scarring, and not the disease process. A totally laparoscopic approach may reduce the risk of infertility in women undergoing ileal pouch anal anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Women should be counseled preoperatively regarding the risk of infertility. If medically feasible, women with inflammatory bowel disease may choose to delay elective restorative proctectomy until their child bearing is complete. </p><p>The evaluation and management of female infertility are&nbsp;discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H221653042\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Splenic salvage should be the first maneuver to control bleeding and a splenectomy reserved for cases when a splenorrhaphy is not possible. (See <a href=\"#H12350972\" class=\"local\">'Splenic injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple enterotomies in a segment of small bowel are repaired by segmentectomy and primary anastomosis. A single enterotomy is repaired in a one or two layer closure. (See <a href=\"#H12351054\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel and duodenal injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of presacral bleeding is difficult because of the anatomy of the pelvis and the fragility of the venous plexus. Attempts to electrocauterize or suture ligate the vessels will lead to further vascular injury and increased bleeding. The initial management is to apply direct pressure over the bleeding site to achieve temporary control. This allows the anesthesia team time to resuscitate and replace volume loss, and prepare for possible additional blood loss prior to definitive control of the hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H98515550\" class=\"local\">'Presacral bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of the ureters during pelvic dissection and colorectal surgery is strongly advised to avoid injury. Repair of an injured ureter includes use of a stent, or in cases of more extensive damage, advanced surgical repair. (See <a href=\"#H12351106\" class=\"local\">'Ureteral injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic dissection is associated with a significant risk of urinary dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and, in women, infertility. The risk of urinary dysfunction persisting beyond the early (30-day) postoperative period is low. Sexual dysfunction following proctocolectomy is related to the extensiveness of the dissection of the pelvic nerves. Since the infertility rate for women with inflammatory bowel disease increases following proctocolectomy, a delay in surgery until after child bearing may be considered if medically possible. (See <a href=\"#H98515627\" class=\"local\">'Female infertility'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Daly JM, DeCosse JJ.
