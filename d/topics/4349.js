Comorbidities can arise due to common underlying predispositions, direct effects of seizures, underlying epilepsy etiologies, and adverse effects of antiseizure drugs and other therapies. Depression and anxiety are particularly common in adults with epilepsy, and screening should be a routine part of long-term follow-up.</p><p>The most common comorbidities and complications of epilepsy in adults are discussed here. An overview of the management of epilepsy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4167947718\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of patients with epilepsy must include consideration of the psychosocial dimensions of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition to medical and psychiatric comorbidities, patients with epilepsy suffer from loss of independence, underemployment, decreased leisure time, and decreased physical activity compared with unaffected adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Employment status is often negatively impacted by epilepsy, even when seizures are infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In one survey, more than 40 percent of college-educated people with seizures that were deemed well controlled were unemployed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy are commonly affected by the loss of independence that is most obvious in their inability to drive. They may also have problems obtaining insurance and finding or maintaining suitable employment. Their self-esteem may also suffer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As the treatment plan is formulated, psychosocial issues must be systematically explored with patients so that appropriate referrals for additional help and counseling can be initiated.</p><p>Patients with epilepsy are more likely to have a poor pattern of health-related behaviors (increased smoking, higher alcohol consumption, less physical activity) compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Counseling regarding these issues may improve health and quality of life.</p><p>A complete psychosocial history includes inquiries about educational background, employment, driving, insurance, interpersonal relationships, previous psychiatric illness (especially depression), and attitude toward having epilepsy. Questionnaires for this purpose are available, and they provide a measurable way of assessing and following patients as pharmacotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions are implemented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Identifying sources of psychosocial stress should lead to the development of strategies to minimize the impact of those stresses on the patient. Patients are often deeply concerned about health, independence, personal growth, relationships, well-being, and security; those with stress-induced seizures may be candidates for stress reduction, biofeedback, or relaxation training. Although direct evidence is limited, psychologic interventions may be of some benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial of 60 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy found that mindfulness-based therapy improved quality of life, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and seizure frequency compared with social support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Many resources are available to help patients. In the absence of a local epilepsy group, patients should be encouraged to contact a regional or national epilepsy organization such as the Epilepsy Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.epilepsy.com/&amp;token=Mc7565XbopULUo1YtDbTd/ghGy23VD6EefDuCJMWJs6vALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=114559\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.epilepsy.com/</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810062849\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of psychiatric disorders, in particular depression and anxiety, occur with increased frequency among people with epilepsy.

The reported prevalence of depression in patients with epilepsy ranges from 13 to 35 percent, with much of the variability explained by differences in methods of ascertaining depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Rates are even higher among patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. In one community health survey, epilepsy was associated with 43 percent higher odds of depression after adjustment for other demographic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Results from surveys in Canada and England have also reported higher odds of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation among those with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for depression in people with epilepsy include epilepsy-related disability, unemployment and activity restriction, impaired social support, and a perceived stigma associated with the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other reports that find a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity (including depression, bipolar disease, psychosis, anxiety, and suicidality) predating seizure onset suggest a bidirectional relationship and perhaps a common underlying mechanism for psychiatric disorders and epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Adverse effects of antiseizure drugs and other medications should not be overlooked as a contributing factor to mood disorders.

One study suggested that the presence of a mood disorder also increases the likelihood of an antiseizure drug-related adverse event, which may, in turn, contribute to drug intolerance and nonadherence as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1212533788\"><span class=\"h3\">Suicide risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suicide risk is a particular concern in patients with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Some SSRIs and SNRIs and most tricyclic antidepressants have effects on cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes that can alter metabolism of some antiseizure drugs; specific interactions may be determined by use of the Lexi-Interact tool within UpToDate.
