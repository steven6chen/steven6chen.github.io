They cause many types of illnesses, including the common cold.</p><p>Adenovirus infections are not serious in most people, but they can be serious in young babies and people who have trouble fighting infections. This includes people who have had organ or stem cell transplants, people with cancer, and people with HIV infection.</p><p>Adenovirus infections happen more often in children than adults. They almost always cause a fever along with other symptoms. Adenovirus infections spread easily, so it is not unusual for there to be &quot;outbreaks&quot; of infections. For example, this can happen in daycare centers. People just starting in the military also tend to get adenovirus infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7367958\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of adenovirus infections?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of adenovirus infections are different depending on what part of the body the virus infects. Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Runny nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjunctivitis (also called &quot;pink eye&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hoarse voice</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7367973\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you do not have trouble fighting infections, then probably not. Adenovirus infections usually get better on their own. But if any of your symptoms are severe or last longer than a few days, you should see your doctor or nurse.</p><p>You should also see your doctor or nurse if you have trouble fighting infections. For example, see your doctor or nurse if you have had an organ or stem cell transplant or if you have cancer or HIV infection.</p><p>The symptoms of adenovirus infection can also happen with more serious infections. To make sure that your child does not have one of these more serious infections, you should take your child to a doctor or nurse if he or she is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger than 3 months and has a rectal temperature of 100.4&ordm;F (38&ordm;C) or higher. Your infant should see a doctor or nurse even if he or she looks normal or seems fine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 3 and 36 months and has a rectal temperature of 100.4&ordm;F (38&ordm;C) or higher for more than 3 days. Go right away of your child seems sick or is fussy, clingy, or refuses to drink fluids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 3 and 36 months old and has a rectal temperature of 102&ordm;F (38.9&ordm;C) or higher.</p><p/><p>Children of any age should also see a doctor or nurse if they have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An oral, rectal, ear, or forehead temperature of 104&ordm;F (40&ordm;C) or higher</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An armpit temperature of 103&ordm;F (39.4&ordm;C) or higher</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A seizure caused by a fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fevers that keep coming back (even if they last only a few hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever as well as an ongoing medical problem, such as heart disease, cancer, lupus, or sickle cell anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever as well as a new skin rash</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7367988\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. But if your symptoms or your child's symptoms are severe, the doctor might do tests to find out the cause of the infection. He or she might also order tests if lots of people in your area get the same type of infection. For example, doctors might do tests if lots of children at the same summer camp get an eye infection along with a sore throat and fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7368003\"><span class=\"h1\">How are adenovirus infections treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenovirus infections usually get better on their own without any treatment. But these infections can be serious in young babies or people who have problems fighting infections. In rare cases, doctors prescribe medicines that fight viruses. These are called &quot;anti-viral medicines.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7368018\"><span class=\"h1\">Can adenovirus infections be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to prevent an adenovirus infection is to keep your hands clean. Wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol gel rubs.</p><p>Some other ways to prevent the spread of infection are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always wash your hands with soap and water after you change your child's diaper.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean sinks, counters, and other surfaces with a bleach and water mixture.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not share towels, bed linens, pajamas, or other personal items.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7368033\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rotavirus infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis-pink-eye-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Conjunctivitis (pink eye) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
