These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 &ndash; Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) is an inhibitory receptor on the T cell surface that binds with either CD80 or CD86 on antigen-presenting cells. CD80 and CD86 are also known as B7-1 and B7-2, respectively, and are sometimes referred to simply as B7. The binding of CTLA4 eventually leads to the termination of an immune response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surface antigens &ndash; CD4 is an antigen that was believed to be unique to T helper cells but is now known to be present on other functional subpopulations such as T regulatory cells. Attempts to interrupt the function of T cells through the administration of both depleting and non-depleting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were among the first attempts at developing biologic agents for the rheumatic diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T-cell receptors &ndash; T-cell receptors (TcRs) expressed on pathogenic synovial T cells offer another potential target for therapy. The rationale for this method is based upon the assumption that these T cells express a limited set of TcRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class II major histocompatibility complex antigens &ndash; Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens combine with the TcR and antigen to form the &quot;trimolecular complex,&quot; which is central to immune responses. Attempts to prevent immune responses by targeting specific class II MHC molecules that bind culprit antigen are limited because of the lack of information regarding the specific antigen(s) recognized by pathogenic T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p><p/><p>All four of these sites have been targeted in laboratory models and in clinical trials in humans with RA. Future efforts may involve the upregulation of T regulatory cells (CD25hi, FoxP3+) by administration of low-dose interleukin (IL)-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>An effective approach of interfering with T-cell function through the binding of CTLA4, leading to inhibition of the &quot;second signal&quot; required for T-cell activation, has been developed.

Second, binding of cell surface costimulatory molecules that provide an essential &quot;second signal&quot; for activation must occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Two important costimulatory systems have been delineated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD28 (an activation receptor) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; an inhibitory receptor) can bind to one of two other proteins, CD80 or CD86 (B7-1 or B7-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD40 binds to CD40 ligand (also known as CD40L, CD154, or gp39) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>These costimulatory molecules regulate T-cell activation and T-cell-dependent B-cell function.

It consists of the extracellular domain of CTLA4 and the Fc portion of IgG1. CTLA4-Ig binds CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) on antigen-presenting cells, thereby acting as a competitive inhibitor of the CD28-B7 costimulatory interaction. Because soluble CTLA4-Ig binds to CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), it prevents the second activation signal received by T cells via CD28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abatacept</a> is available in a number of countries. It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> in RA has been analyzed in a 2009 meta-analysis, which included seven randomized trials with 2908 patients and compared abatacept (alone or in combination with nonbiologic or biologic DMARDs) with placebo (alone or in combination with nonbiologic or biologic DMARDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Patients on abatacept were significantly more likely to achieve an American College of Rheumatology 50 percent improvement (ACR50) response at one year (relative risk [RR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.8, and absolute risk difference of 21 percent, 95% CI 16-27). Improvements in physical function and reduction in disease activity and pain were also significant.</p><p>There was a significantly increased number of serious infections at 12 months in the abatacept-treated patients compared with placebo (Peto odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.4), a finding consistent with trends observed in another meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Notably, among patients who had a previous hospitalization for infection while receiving a TNF inhibitor, the risk of subsequent hospitalization for another infection while on a biologic was lowest in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> compared with other biologic agents, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Serious adverse events were also increased when abatacept was used in combination with other biologic DMARDs (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.6). Serious infections most commonly associated with abatacept were those of the bronchopulmonary tree.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abatacept</a> was initially available only for intravenous (IV) use but can also be administered subcutaneously (SC) by switching from ongoing IV therapy or at the time that abatacept treatment is initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16,17</a>]. The manufacturer recommends that weekly SC administration should be preceded by an IV loading dose, although the loading dose is not required in patients unable to receive an infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of the SC and IV preparations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> were comparable in a randomized trial involving 1457 patients with a previous inadequate response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The efficacy of abatacept SC (125 mg SC on days 1 and 8, then weekly, plus an IV loading dose on day 1 of approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> was comparable to abatacept IV (approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV on days 1, 15, 29, then every four weeks) in achieving an ACR20 response after six months of treatment (both 76 percent). The onset and magnitude of the responses, disease activity, improvements in physical function, and adverse effects were also comparable. Injection site reactions were mostly mild and were as frequent in patients receiving the active SC drug as in those receiving SC placebo (2.5 to 2.6 percent). Pooled data from five randomized trials involving 1879 patients found no new safety concerns for SC, compared with IV, administration over a mean duration of exposure of more than 27 months.</p><p>Patients whose disease is well-controlled on long-term IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> can switch to receiving the medication by SC administration while maintaining clinical efficacy and without increased safety issues. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of switching patients from long-term IV to SC abatacept were evaluated in an open-label, single-arm study in 123 patients who had completed at least four years of treatment with the IV form of the drug after inadequate responses to traditional DMARDs or TNF inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The patients were switched to SC administered abatacept (125 mg each week). After three months, 97 percent of patients were still receiving SC abatacept. At 12 months, clinical efficacy was maintained in 90 percent of patients. No patient discontinued abatacept for lack of efficacy, while the adverse event rate was similar to previous studies, and serious adverse events were uncommon (0.8 percent). Injection site reactions were mild and were also uncommon (1.6 percent).</p><p>A number of studies have also documented the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> in certain important subsets of patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-25</a>]. These include patients with active RA resistant to either MTX or the combination of MTX and TNF inhibitor, as well as MTX-na&iuml;ve patients with early RA and poor prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20,21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,25</a>]. In studies evaluating radiographic outcomes, abatacept demonstrated significant inhibition of radiographic progression in addition to clinical improvement. Additionally, two-year follow-up data for one of the trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], which compared abatacept plus MTX with MTX alone in early RA patients with erosive joint disease, showed sustained clinical benefit and no added safety concerns with the combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The patients receiving abatacept plus MTX also experienced statistically significantly less radiographic progression (change in Genant-modified Sharp total score of 0.84 versus 1.75).</p><p>Treatment of RA patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> has not been associated with an increased frequency of malignancy in the abatacept clinical trials participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Abatacept should not be used concurrently with TNF inhibitors or with the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. Live vaccines should not be given concurrently or within three months of stopping abatacept.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Belatacept</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=belatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Belatacept</a> is a second-generation CTLA4-Ig that has superior binding to CD80 and CD86 compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>.

Subsequently, CD40 and CD40L inhibitors have been developed without Fc functionality to avoid these adverse events. In preliminary reports, a 12-week proof-of-concept randomized trial of BI655064, an anti-CD40 mAb, was described in 67 patients with RA who were MTX-monotherapy inadequate responders, finding positive ACR20 responses without evidence of safety concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

Both depleting and non-depleting mAbs against CD4 were determined to be ineffective in randomized clinical trials. The results of these trials are discussed briefly because of their impact on the subsequent design of clinical trials of biologic agents in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p><p>Between 1989 and 1995, there were eight open trials involving 129 patients treated with anti-CD4 mAbs. All eight reported clinical benefit. However, three subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving a total of 133 patients all reported negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. The discordance between the open-label studies and randomized trial results was attributed to both the strong placebo effect and expectation bias (ie, false assumptions on the part of the investigators that the therapies would be effective) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>A number of observations may explain the lack of clinical efficacy following depleting mAb treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depletion of peripheral CD4+ T cells, although profound, may have been inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts were found to be profoundly depressed following administration of either of the two mAbs used in these trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].

These effects are specific to the peptide administered, and adoptive transfer of serum from these animals delays the onset of arthritis in recipient animals.

Through its high affinity binding for CD28, CTLA4-Ig interferes with the binding of CD80 (B7-1) or CD86 (B7-2) to CD28, thereby inhibiting transmission of the second signal required for T-cell activation. Abatacept was initially available only for intravenous (IV) use but can also be administered subcutaneously (SC).
