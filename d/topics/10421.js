The latter can lead to a marked decrease in insulin requirement or even the cessation of insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Both of these abnormalities are at least partially reversed with the institution of dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbohydrate-and-insulin-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbohydrate and insulin metabolism in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of the uncertainty in predicting insulin requirements, careful individualized therapy is essential among patients who have advanced CKD or are initiating dialysis.</p><p>The insulin requirement in any given patient depends upon the net balance between improving tissue sensitivity and restoring normal hepatic insulin metabolism. In addition, among patients on peritoneal dialysis, glucose contained in peritoneal dialysate tends to increase the need for diabetes therapy. Changes in dietary intake and exercise (ie, reduced intake due to anorexia prior to starting dialysis) can also affect the response to administered insulin. Furthermore, the uremic environment can affect methods used to assess glycemic control, and the metabolism of most oral diabetes agents is prolonged, making them more difficult to use.</p><p>This topic reviews glycemic targets, methods of monitoring glycemic control, and suggested treatment regimens for patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The treatment of diabetes in kidney transplant recipients is discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) in renal transplant recipients&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>). Monitoring and maintaining glycemic control in the general population is discussed elsewhere.

Thus, we use serial measurements (two to four times yearly) of glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C, A1C) to assess chronic glycemic control in diabetic patients with predialysis CKD or ESRD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H15054361\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Monitoring and target A1C'</a>.)</p><p>However, A1C may not be as accurate among ESRD patients as in the general population due to biological and patient-specific factors. Some of the methods used to measure A1C, such as agar gel electrophoresis, are affected by ESRD. This is due, in part, to analytical interference from carbamylated hemoglobin formed in the presence of elevated concentrations of urea, leading to false elevations in the A1C level. The Boronate-agarose affinity chromatography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperglycemia-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes-and-pre-dialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-or-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and the thiobarbituric acid method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperglycemia-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes-and-pre-dialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-or-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] are techniques for analyzing A1C that can be used reliably in ESRD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estimation-of-blood-glucose-control-in-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estimation of blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycated hemoglobin'</a>.)</p><p>Other factors that affect the accuracy of these assays in ESRD include reduced red blood cell life span, recent transfusion, iron deficiency, accelerated erythropoiesis due to administration of erythropoietin, and metabolic acidosis. As a result, A1C values may be falsely elevated or decreased in those with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperglycemia-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes-and-pre-dialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-or-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1,3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-9</a>]. It is important to be aware of the specific assay used in each dialysis facility and the extent to which kidney disease and other factors affect the accuracy of A1C measurements. Laboratories should only use A1C assay methods certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (<a href=\"http://www.ngsp.org/&amp;token=EcqnCJGt7p0Lqku9deP4AYHP477fHe4o/kkYwx4K2To=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1857\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NGSP</a>).

Although glycated albumin also reflects mean glycemia, it reflects glycemic control over a much shorter interval (7 to 14 days, compared with 60 to 120 days for A1C). Glycated albumin measurements may not be reliable in patients with proteinuria or in those on peritoneal dialysis. In addition, in a small study in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD undergoing intravenous iron or erythropoietin therapy, A1C (compared with glycated albumin and other markers of glycemic control) was most closely associated with mean blood glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperglycemia-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes-and-pre-dialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-or-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There are no long-term clinical trials evaluating the relationship between glycated albumin and risk of chronic complications of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperglycemia-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes-and-pre-dialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-or-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. For these reasons, we prefer monitoring glycemic control with A1C.

The effectiveness of self-monitoring in patients with type 2 diabetes who do not use hypoglycemic agents is less certain. The indications for and practical points about blood glucose monitoring are reviewed elsewhere.

Careful, individualized therapy is essential among patients with advanced CKD or on dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) concentration to monitor for hyperglycemia in all patients with diabetes and predialysis CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), although A1C may not be as accurate among ESRD patients as in the general population. It is important to be aware of the specific assay used in each dialysis facility and the extent to which kidney disease and other factors affect the accuracy of A1C measurements. (See <a href=\"#H109015232\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring glycemic control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The A1C target that is associated with the best outcome in predialysis CKD patients has not been established. For most predialysis CKD patients, we suggest using an A1C goal of approximately 7 percent, rather than lower values (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycemic targets'</a> and <a href=\"#H115815287\" class=\"local\">'Nondialysis CKD patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The A1C goal that is associated with the best outcome in dialysis patients has not been established, and most studies have suggested that rigorous glycemic control does not lead to better outcomes. The A1C goal we use depends upon the age of the patients, the risk of hypoglycemia, and upon comorbid conditions (see <a href=\"#H115815294\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis patients'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are relatively young (&le;50 years) and have no other significant comorbid conditions, we suggest using an A1C goal of 7 to 7.5, rather than higher values (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For older patients (ie, &gt;50 years) who have multiple comorbid conditions, we suggest using an A1C goal of 7.5 to 8, rather than lower values (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of nondialysis CKD and dialysis patients with diabetes involves both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. The nonpharmacologic therapies include dietary modification, exercise, and weight reduction. Pharmacologic therapies include insulin and oral agents. Our pharmacologic approach varies depending upon whether patients have predialysis CKD or are on dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nondialysis CKD patients with type 2 diabetes, we suggest initial treatment with an oral agent, rather than insulin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

Several different insulin regimens can be used to achieve glycemic control. Examples include: twice-daily intermediate-acting insulin, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> given before breakfast and before supper, or long-acting insulin, with two or three times daily supplemental regular insulin, given two or three times per day before meals.

The preferred agents and suggested initial doses are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glimepiride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glimepiride</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repaglinide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Repaglinide</a>, starting with a dose of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> can also be considered. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> should not be used among peritoneal dialysis patients, because of an increased risk of lactic acidosis.
