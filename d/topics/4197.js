Closed reduction and casting provides definitive treatment for displaced Salter-Harris I or II, greenstick, and complete distal forearm fractures in children and is often accomplished under sedation in the emergency department. These reductions can be performed by appropriately trained personnel or orthopedic surgeons.</p><p>Fracture reduction and casting of distal forearm fractures in children will be reviewed here.

Reduction and immobilization are necessary for significantly displaced or severely angulated closed distal forearm fractures, including displaced complete (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81035\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81035 \">image 1</a>), greenstick (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69866\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69866 \">image 2</a>), and Salter Harris I or II fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79636\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79636 \">image 3</a>).

In this situation, the managing clinician may choose to transfer the child to a facility where the fracture can undergo definitive management or, in exceptional circumstances and when the fracture poses no neurovascular risk, splint the fracture with a sugar tong and long arm splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50501 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70004 \">figure 2</a>) and assure orthopedic reduction and immobilization within 24 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H940169\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to casting of distal forearm fractures include any injury that warrants urgent evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon, especially those injuries that warrant emergency surgery. </p><p>Examples include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open fractures that require debridement and definitive orthopedic care in the operating room (OR). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salter-Harris III, IV, or V physeal (growth plate) distal radius or ulna fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76017\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76017 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61682\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61682 \">image 5</a>) require reduction by an orthopedist with pediatric expertise. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal forearm fractures complicated by joint dislocation (wrist or elbow) or supracondylar fracture also warrant prompt involvement of an orthopedic surgeon and frequently require closed or open reduction in the operating room.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H940251\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H940544\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caregivers should provide written informed consent for closed reduction and casting.

The clinician should ensure that a careful neurovascular examination precedes attempts at closed reduction.

Portable fluoroscopy is useful to check the adequacy of reduction during the procedure. Malrotation of the radius and ulna must also be corrected by supination or pronation; rotational alignment of the radius is more important than that of the ulna. A reduced complete distal forearm fracture is prone to malposition over time. Maintaining reduction with good cast technique is essential. (See <a href=\"#H941771\" class=\"local\">'Casting'</a> below.)</p><p>Once a fracture reduction is performed, the child should follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon within a week for radiographic assessment of fracture position. Subsequently, the patient is seen on a regular basis for the first few weeks to monitor for loss of reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. </p><p>Up to 25 percent of complete fractures displace during follow-up despite adequate initial closed reduction and casting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. These fractures may require repeat closed reduction, cast wedging, or operative intervention. More than 50 percent initial displacement, lack of anatomic reduction, or AP to lateral diameter (cast index) &lt;0.7 are associated with a higher risk of re-displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2136773\"><span class=\"h2\">Greenstick fracture reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A greenstick fracture is a complete fracture of the tension side of the cortex of the radius or ulna and a plastic deformation, or buckling, of the compression side.

This approach allows time for the swelling to go down before the cast is placed but may risk loss of reduction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H941771\"><span class=\"h2\">Casting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An overview of casting is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-definitive-fracture-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of definitive fracture management&quot;, section on 'Casting'</a>.)</p><p>Key aspects for casting distal forearm fractures are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arm position</strong> &ndash; After a fracture reduction, the elbow should be placed at 90 degrees before <strong>any </strong>casting material is applied; if it is flexed after material is applied, it causes bunching and irritation at the elbow. Typically, a second person is needed to hold the arm (by the fingers) in the proper position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Materials</strong> &ndash; The layers of the cast consist of stockinette next to the skin, cotton padding (eg, two inch Webril) that is rolled with one half inch overlap, and two inch fiberglass or plaster casting material. Extra padding should be applied to common pressure points at the wrist and elbow. The antecubital area should have only one to two layers of Webril, with extra strips placed over the back of the elbow. Short strips of folded Webril can be placed around the thumb, and at the proximal and distal ends of the cast for extra padding. It is important to ensure no major wrinkles exist in the stockinette and the padding before casting material is applied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molding</strong> &ndash; Three-point molding of the forearm portion of the cast maintains the fracture reduction and allows the clinician to mold the cast without causing pressure points. The palm of one hand pushes gently distal to the fracture on the side of the intact periosteum, while the palm of the other hand pushes gently proximal to the fracture on the opposite side of the arm. When molding a cast, recreate the force in the direction that was used to reduce the fracture. An assistant's hand is placed more proximally on the arm (below the elbow) on the same side as the most distal hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73696\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73696 \">figure 8</a>). Once completed, the cast should be wider in the AP diameter than in the lateral diameter (lateral to AP diameter ratio 0.7) and the ulnar border should be straight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Forearm position in the cast</strong> &ndash; The cast should be in neutral position with respect to supination and pronation of the hand. Although some orthopedists prefer the wrist to be casted in slight flexion with ulnar deviation to counteract opposing muscles, an observational study of 109 children with distal forearm fractures concluded that the position of immobilization (neutral, pronation, or supination) does not appear to affect maintenance of fracture reduction and residual angulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Length of cast</strong> &ndash; Little data is available to evaluate the long-term outcomes of the length of the cast on fracture healing and wrist and elbow function in children with complete distal forearm fractures. We suggest that a long arm cast be used to maintain reduction of a greenstick or complete distal forearm fracture, especially in children under five years of age and in teenagers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. A long arm cast immobilizes the elbow and neutralizes the forces of the muscles that could displace the reduction. A short arm cast is acceptable for immobilization of displaced Salter I or II fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Short arm casts offer the obvious advantage of causing less motion restriction in casted patients and less elbow stiffness when the cast is removed. Limited observational evidence suggests that a properly molded short arm cast maintains closed reduction of complete distal forearm fractures with similar anatomic and functional outcomes to those achieved with long arm casts in children between the ages of 5 and 12 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76531\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76531 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. However, given the lack of evidence, many pediatric orthopedists prefer to use long arm casts initially in these children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cast splitting</strong> &ndash; If a large amount of swelling is expected (eg, reduced complete or greenstick fracture), the cast is allowed to set and then is split on both sides with a cast saw (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68520\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68520 \">figure 9</a>). It is then wrapped with an elastic wrap (eg, Ace wrap). This procedure avoids neurovascular complications related to arm swelling. The clinician should provide a sling to support the cast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Post-casting neurovascular assessment</strong> &ndash; The patient should have good perfusion of the fingers and be able to fully extend his or her fingers and thumb actively and passively after casting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Poor perfusion, pain on finger extension, or limitation of finger or thumb motion suggests tendon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> muscle entrapment or a tight cast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assessment of reduction and casting</strong> &ndash; After closed reduction and casting, post-reduction radiographs are obtained in the radiology department or at the bedside using fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Bedside fluoroscopy has the advantage of timeliness, continued ability to monitor the patient after sedation, and lower radiation exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H942224\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCHARGE AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once adequate fracture alignment and immobilization is documented radiographically, the child is fully recovered from sedation, and cast instructions have been provided, the child may be discharged home. (See <a href=\"#H942155\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Timing for orthopedic follow-up depends upon the method of immobilization and the type of fracture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a splint is applied, the patient should be referred for cast application by an orthopedic surgeon within two to five days regardless of the fracture type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with casted Salter I or II and greenstick fractures may be referred for orthopedic evaluation in one week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with casted complete fractures warrant close follow-up to monitor for displacement and should be seen within one week. </p><p/><p>Home analgesia, duration of immobilization, and timing for return to full activity are discussed in detail separately.

Reduction and immobilization are necessary for significantly displaced or severely angulated closed distal forearm fractures, including displaced complete (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81035\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81035 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77309\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77309 \">image 7</a>), greenstick (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69866\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69866 \">image 2</a>), and Salter Harris I or II fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79636\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79636 \">image 3</a>). Closed reduction followed by casting or splinting provides definitive treatment for the majority of these fractures. When questions about the need for reduction arise in children with distal forearm fractures, discussion with an orthopedic surgeon with pediatric expertise is warranted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should ensure that caregivers have a full understanding of the risks of fracture reduction including adverse effects of procedural sedation, potential loss of reduction despite appropriate care with the potential need for open reduction and fixation in the operating room, and the potential for cosmetic or functional adverse outcomes, depending upon the type of fracture (eg, growth arrest with Salter-Harris I or II fractures, refracture with greenstick or complete fractures, loss of wrist rotation with complete fractures). The clinician should ensure that a careful neurovascular examination precedes attempts at closed reduction. (See <a href=\"#H940544\" class=\"local\">'Informed consent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedural sedation provides appropriate analgesia for pediatric forearm fracture reductions and may be augmented by a hematoma or regional intravenous block. (See <a href=\"#H940147\" class=\"local\">'Sedation and analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The equipment and techniques for closed reduction of distal forearm fractures are described in detail in the text. Portable fluoroscopy is useful to check the adequacy of reduction during the procedure. Once the fracture is reduced and immobilized, plain radiographs should be obtained to confirm adequate reduction. (See <a href=\"#H940392\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the fracture is reduced, the clinician may choose to immobilize the arm using a splint or a cast. Splinting of reduced distal forearm fractures varies by the type of fracture (see <a href=\"#H941764\" class=\"local\">'Splinting'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Salter I or II fractures</strong> &ndash; Sugar tong splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50501 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Greenstick or complete fractures</strong> &ndash; Sugar tong alone or combined sugar tong and long arm splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50501 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70004 \">figure 2</a>). For this splinting combination, the sugar tong splint should be placed first and then the long arm splint applied. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When using a cast for immobilization of distal forearm fractures, we suggest that a long arm cast be used to maintain reduction of a greenstick or complete distal forearm fracture, especially in children under five years of age and in teenagers (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A short arm cast is acceptable for immobilization of displaced Salter I or II fractures. (See <a href=\"#H941771\" class=\"local\">'Casting'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For proper cast application, it is important for the clinician to do the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Place elbow at 90 degrees before applying any cast material and limit extremity movement during casting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Protect the skin with stockinette as the first layer and cover with adequate amounts of padding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use extra padding over bony prominences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cast the forearm in neutral position with respect to supination and pronation of the hand. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ensure three point molding such that the lateral to AP diameter on radiograph is 0.7.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients in whom significant swelling is anticipated (eg, complete fractures, greenstick fractures), longitudinally split the cast on the dorsal and ventral surfaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68520\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68520 \">figure 9</a>) and apply an elastic wrap to help prevent the development of a tight cast secondary to tissue swelling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ensure good perfusion and active and passive mobility of the fingers and thumb after casting. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing for orthopedic follow-up depends upon the method of immobilization and the type of fracture. (See <a href=\"#H942224\" class=\"local\">'Discharge and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Casting has a number of potential complications, including pressure sores, neurovascular compromise, acute compartment syndrome, and disuse atrophy. Thus, any child in a cast who appears to be in severe pain, is unable to move the fingers, has cold or blue fingers or complains of burning, tingling, or numbness should be evaluated immediately.
