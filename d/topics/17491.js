While the prognosis for TGA is generally benign, other diseases in the differential diagnosis carry potential for serious long-term sequelae, making it important for clinicians to be familiar with the diagnosis and evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the general population, the incidence of transient global amnesia (TGA) has been estimated as 5.2 to 10 per 100,000 per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Among those 50 years and older, it is 23.5 to 32 per 100,000 per year.</p><p>The majority of episodes occur in individuals between the ages of 50 and 80 years, with a mean age of onset between 60 and 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The incidence of TGA does not differ according to gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>].</p><p>Atherosclerotic risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia) are not believed to be associated with TGA. While common in this aged population, most case-control studies find no difference in the prevalence of these risk factors between TGA patients and age and gender-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-14</a>]. In contrast, in one large case-control study, TGA patients were more likely than age and sex-matched controls to have hyperlipidemia, previous ischemic stroke, and ischemic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Compared with a cohort of patients with TIA admitted over the same time period, patients with TGA were less likely to have hypertension, diabetes, a history of ischemic stroke, and atrial fibrillation.</p><p>Migraine has been found to be strongly associated with TGA in some, but not all, case-control studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,9,10,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10,16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical neuroanatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical symptoms of TGA suggest that the primary site of neurologic involvement is the mediobasal temporal lobe and hippocampus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/6,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18,19</a>]. Functional neuroimaging studies provide evidence that this area is involved in the formation and retrieval of new episodic memories, the primary neurologic deficit in TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Neuroimaging studies demonstrate that this area is pathologically affected in TGA. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI) studies in acute and subacute stages of TGA have demonstrated lesions in the hippocampus; high resolution imaging studies have specifically implicated the CA-1, Sommer sector [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/8,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20-22</a>]. Lesions are most often unilateral and left-sided, but right-sided and bilateral lesions also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In contrast, a functional MRI study found bilateral, reversible disturbances in episodic memory networks in 12 patients who were examined during an acute TCA episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In patients who had acute neuroimaging and neuropsychological evaluation, evidence of lateralization is congruent in both tests; that is, prominent verbal memory loss was associated with dominant-side hippocampal lesions, while more prominent visuospatial memory deficits were associated with nondominant hippocampal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>]. Cases of TGA have also been described in patients who have previously had a hippocampal resection for treatment of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Neurons in the CA-1 area of the hippocampus are known to be selectively vulnerable to cellular metabolic stress, specifically in the setting of hypoxia and ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/8,21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21,25</a>]. This vulnerability may relate to sensitivity to cytotoxic glutamanergic release and uptake, or to the vascular anatomy of the hippocampus, as this area may represent a watershed between two major arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus regarding an underlying cause of TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/6,26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,26-32</a>]. Hypotheses include a vascular etiology (either arterial or venous), a migrainous phenomenon or cortical spreading depression, epilepsy, and a psychogenic disorder. None of these hypotheses clearly and consistently explains the clinical features of TGA. Unfortunately, the results of neuroimaging studies, while demonstrating a consistent locus of pathologic involvement, do not clearly delineate the underlying etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TGA shares some features with transient ischemic attack (TIA), specifically a duration of less than 24 hours and occurrence in older adults. Some episodes of TGA have occurred in settings associated with acute cerebrovascular thromboembolism, such as vertebral artery angioplasty and stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], basilar artery thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and hypercoagulable conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. There have also been well-described stroke syndromes that produce acute amnesia, similar to that seen in TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>However, other clinical observations argue against arterial thromboembolism as a cause for most cases of TGA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TGA episodes are longer in duration than typical TIAs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TGA patients have a lower atherosclerotic risk burden than patients with TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,10,11,16,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,11,16,44-46</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In follow-up studies, patients with TGA have a risk of future stroke and death that is lower than TIA patients and resembles that of an age-matched population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/3,10,44,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,44,47</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment and prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many patients, TGA appears to be precipitated by events that are not associated with TIA. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Others have speculated that less common causes of TIA and stroke may underlie TGA, explaining the lower atherosclerotic risk burden and more benign prognosis. As an example, the frequent association of TGA with a Valsalva maneuver at onset led to the suggestion that paradoxical embolism from a patent foramen ovale may cause TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, while one case-control study found that patent foramen ovale was more prevalent in patients with TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], this was not confirmed in a follow-up study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hypotension has been suggested as a mechanism for TGA; because the arterial arcade supplying the posterior hippocampus contains right-angled branches, it may be more susceptible to ischemia with changes in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Finally, arterial vasospasm has also been proposed as a cause for TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Findings from structural and functional neuroimaging studies have provided data that both support and refute arterial ischemia as a pathogenesis for TGA.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DWI-MRI &mdash; Punctate areas of signal abnormality on DWI-MRI in the hippocampus are often described in patients with TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1222381688\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging findings'</a> below.) In TGA, these lesions resolve and do not evolve into permanent T2 lesions. While most often associated with acute ischemia, DWI lesions are not specific to TIA or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one study, DWI lesions were no more common in 86 TGA patients than in 172 age- and sex-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the prevalence of DWI findings (11.5 percent) in TGA patients was somewhat lower in this series than others.<br/><br/>In fact, some note that the lesions seen in TGA are somewhat atypical of those seen in TIA; the latter are larger, are more likely to be observed in the first few hours of the onset of symptoms, and are more likely to evolve into a permanent T2 abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/6,8,32,45,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,32,45,52</a>]. One investigation observed that the lesions observed in TGA have higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values than are usual for TIA-associated lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Another study found that the lesions in TGA were not associated with perfusion deficits, as would be expected for an ischemic etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. MR spectroscopy demonstrates a lactate peak in these lesions, consistent with, but not specific for, an arterial ischemic etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SPECT &mdash; SPECT scanning in cases of TGA have shown variable results, usually hypoperfusion in one or both temporal lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>]. Hyperperfusion or involvement of other brain areas is uncommonly reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. These findings do not indicate whether the alteration in cerebral blood flow is a primary event or a secondary phenomenon related to changes in cerebral metabolism from another etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PET &mdash; During the TGA attack, PET scans have shown abnormalities in several brain regions including the hippocampus, amygdala, lentiform nucleus, and the frontal lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,18,26,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,26,55</a>]. However, findings appear to be consistent with stable cerebral blood flow and a reduction in regional oxygen uptake, suggesting altered neuronal activity rather than a vascular event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler ultrasound &mdash; A case control study of 75 patients found that extra- or intracranial arterial atherosclerosis was similarly prevalent in patients and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other laboratory studies &mdash; In one study, measures of platelet activation were seen in patients with TIA and acute stroke, but not in patients with TGA or normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Venous congestion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venous congestion was proposed as an alternative pathogenesis to arterial ischemia for TGA, in part based on the observation that specific events appeared to frequently trigger TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These include Valsalva maneuver, vigorous activity of the arms, sympathetic activation from acute emotional events, and cold water immersion (diving reflex). In this paradigm, increases in either intrathoracic pressure or venous return could lead to central venous congestion affecting the deep venous system that drains the dorsomedial thalamus and hippocampus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/21,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,31</a>].</p><p>The basal veins of Rosenthal provide venous drainage from the mesial temporal lobes to the vein of Galen. This vein drains to the inferior sagittal sinus and then to the straight sinus, which most commonly becomes the left transverse sinus. This pattern of venous drainage has been used to explain how venous reflux into the left internal jugular vein could affect both mesial temporal lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Venous congestion may preferentially affect the anterior hippocampus as only the inferior ventricular vein drains this portion of the hippocampus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Some feel that venous congestion better explains the appearance of the MRI-DWI lesions than does the arterial ischemia, particularly the time course and reversibility of the lesions, as well as the higher ADC coefficient than is typical for acute ischemia of arterial origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/8,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,52</a>].</p><p>Support for this theory came from a series Doppler ultrasound studies that demonstrated inducible venous reflux in at least one internal jugular vein in a higher prevalence of TGA patients compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/6,9,11,31,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,11,31,58,59</a>]. The largest of these series included 142 patients with TGA and 40 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Valvular insufficiency was found in 80 percent of the TGA patients and 25 percent of the controls. This presumably reflects a premorbid condition of internal jugular valvular insufficiency that then predisposes patients to TGA. MRI studies have also found abnormal venous signals suggesting retrograde venous flow in a higher percentage of TGA patients than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/57,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,60</a>]. These findings seemed particularly relevant in that the demonstration of retrograde flow was more common in TGA patients who reported an antecedent Valsalva maneuver, compared with those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/9,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,57</a>]. </p><p>Inconsistencies in these studies include that the side of apparent valvular insufficiency did not always correlate with the dominant side of venous blood flow, venous flow velocity, or with the lateralization of DWI lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/8,28,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,28,61</a>]. Also, other Doppler ultrasound and MR angiography studies have not found evidence of intracranial venous reflux in TGA patients compared with controls despite the higher prevalence of internal jugular valve insufficiency in the patient group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/59,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,62,63</a>]. </p><p>Some of the questions not answered by the venous congestion hypothesis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Why the venous congestion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ischemia is selective to the anatomic structures related to memory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Why TGA isn't seen more frequently with venous sinus thrombosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Why recurrence is so infrequent if the abnormality can be induced by a Valsalva maneuver</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Why it only occurs in older adults</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Migrainous phenomenon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migraine can cause transient neurologic symptoms (eg, migraine aura and migraine equivalents) and has been proposed as a cause of TGA. The mechanism of migraine aura is understood to be a self-propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, so-called cortical spreading depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In support of this theory is that some, although not all, case-control studies find that a migraine history is associated with TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/9,10,16,17,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,16,17,64</a>]. Some believe that the observed changes on DWI-MRI and PET are most compatible with migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/28,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,65</a>], while others disagree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, migraines tend to present in younger, not older patients and are also a recurring phenomenon, unlike TGA, which usually occurs in older persons as a single event. Two exceptional case reports describe atypical patients with recurrent episodes of TGA that remitted with beta-blockers or valproic acid, treatments often used in the prophylaxis of migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>One unsubstantiated theory is that TGA shares the underlying mechanism of migraine aura, that of a cerebral spreading depression. It is hypothesized that TGA is precipitated by an emotional experience that could trigger the release of glutamate in the hippocampus and trigger cerebral spreading depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Epileptic phenomenon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient amnesia is a documented manifestation of some epileptic seizures. However, epilepsy is not believed to cause TGA. Seizures are recurring, not isolated phenomena, and cases of EEG monitoring during a TGA episode have not shown epileptic discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/6,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,69,70</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychogenic disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the disorder was first described, a psychogenic origin was postulated; however, most clinicians now believe that TGA is an organic disorder, but that psychogenic stressors and psychogenic predisposition may play a contributing role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Evidence for this is slight and circumstantial:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one case series, a high prevalence of phobic personality traits in TGA patients was observed compared to a control patient group with TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. A subsequent analysis also revealed that TGA patients had more frequent history of psychiatric disease (OR = 2.9), alcohol abuse (OR = 3.3), and a family history of psychiatric disease (OR = 3.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another case series, a subgroup of women with TGA appeared to have associated psychological disorders such as personality disorders or a history of anxiety or depression and to have the acute event triggered by an emotional stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, as a group, the TGA patients in this series did not have a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression history compared with controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study evaluating stress-related factors in TGA found that compared to controls, TGA patients were more sensitive to stress, were more anxious, and had less effective coping mechanisms to deal with stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p/><p>It is postulated that emotional upset might induce hyperventilation leading to vasoconstriction, reducing cerebral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In susceptible older patients with small vessel disease, this might lead to focal ischemic symptoms. Alternatively, emotional events could trigger neurotransmitter release in the temporal lobe, affecting hippocampal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/8,26,52,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26,52,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because no one theory of its pathogenesis clearly appears to apply to all patients with TGA, some speculate that, despite its relatively consistent clinical presentation, TGA is a syndrome that has multiple different etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29</a>].</p><p>In one case series, two different potential etiologic groups were identified: arterial ischemia in patients with associated DWI-MRI abnormalities, vascular risk factors, and comorbid carotid arterial plaques; and venous congestion in those whose episodes were initiated with Valsalva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A hierarchical cluster analysis employed in another case series of 142 TGA patients, suggested three distinct subgroups: younger patients (less than 56 years old) with a history of migraine; women with a history of anxiety, depression, and recent emotional stress; and men without medical history and a preceding physical event-trigger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a separate hierarchical cluster analysis of 37 TGA patients using MRI and SPECT to evaluate hippocampal lesions and cortical pathways, two subgroups emerged: hippocampal head DWI lesions were associated with women and with vomiting and nausea at the onset of TGA, and hippocampal body lesions were associated with men and vascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, a comparison of clinical event features among 15 TGA patients with migraine and 42 without revealed no differences between the two groups in regard to mean age, presence of identifiable triggers, associated headache, nausea, or vomiting, event duration, or recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A small study investigated the relationship between TGA and amino acid catabolism and found that plasma levels of L-alanine and glutamine were lower in TGA patients compared to controls, while serum LDH and AST levels were elevated in TGA patients compared to controls, at 3 days, 16 to 24 months, and 2 to 3 years after the TGA event. The authors hypothesize that dysregulation of amino acid catabolism could contribute to increased glutamate in the brain and prolong a TGA attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes of TGA are distinct events, usually with a fairly well defined time of onset.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prominent anterograde amnesia, an inability to form new memories, is the defining clinical feature. Patients are disoriented in time and often repetitively ask questions about the date or their environment, the so-called &quot;broken-record&quot; phenomenon. Immediate recall (eg, digit-span) is intact, but delayed recall is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Retrograde amnesia is common, but more variable and can extend back hours to days, weeks, and rarely years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].<br/><br/>Other cognitive functions are spared. In particular, a loss of self-awareness excludes TGA. Patients are able to perform complex motor tasks such as driving, cooking, lecturing, and playing a musical instrument [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/1,6,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,74</a>].

Patients are left with an amnesic gap for the main episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms may be reported. Between 10 to 40 percent of patients complain of headache during the spell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,8,10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,10,16</a>].

The variable proportion of those with TGA who have apparent event-triggers is probably due to how systematically such events were solicited and what types of events were included as potential triggers. Reported event triggers have included acute emotional events, physical events (eg, strenuous activity, sexual intercourse, Valsalva maneuver, intense pain), postural changes, medical procedures, high altitude, contact with water, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in body temperature, as well as more chronic emotional stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,8,75-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,75-80</a>]. &#160;<br/><br/>These observations have not been confirmed with case-control analysis. However, the relevance of Valsalva maneuver as a triggering event is supported by the fact that inducible retrograde flow in the internal jugular vein is more common in patients who reported a preceding Valsalva maneuver than in those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several studies suggest that more than half of TGA attacks begin in the morning, after the patient has arisen without symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,17,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17,44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1222381688\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROIMAGING FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain is likely to be performed in the emergency department setting and is usually normal or may show incidental findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>A brain MRI is also often normal or shows only incidental findings. Several case series report finding one or more punctate lesions in the hippocampus on DWI-MRI, with an incidence that ranges from zero to 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/2,6-8,13,45,51,65,75,81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8,13,45,51,65,75,81-84</a>]. These lesions are associated with small reductions in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and may be located in the left, right, or bilateral hippocampi. The timing of MRI may impact the likelihood of demonstrating these lesions; they are less common in the hyperacute phase and become more prevalent after 12 hours, with a peak incidence between 12 and 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/7,50,51,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,50,51,82</a>].

Other studies have shown that the detection rate of DWI lesions in TGA is increased by up to 88 percent when the scan is performed within a two to three day window, with a DWI resolution of B=2000, and a thin slice thickness of 2 to 3 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for transient global amnesia (TGA) includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure, epileptic amnesia &mdash; Features that suggest this diagnosis include a short duration of the attack (less than one hour, usually a few to several minutes), occurrence on awakening from sleep, and multiple attacks at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/10,70,74,87-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,70,74,87-90</a>]. Rare cases of transient epileptic amnesia have been reported to last hours or days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Common accompanying symptoms, which may not be volunteered by patients, include olfactory hallucinations and motor automatisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Amnestic seizures are less likely than TGA to be accompanied by anxiety and repetitive questioning, and retrograde amnesia is more prominent than anterograde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. These seizures are believed to arise from the mesial temporal lobe; some patients with epileptic amnesia also have interictal memory deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].<br/><br/>Normal or nonspecific changes on an interictal electroencephalography (EEG) do not exclude the diagnosis. An EEG performed during sleep or with sleep deprivation may improve sensitivity. Prolonged EEG monitoring may be helpful; however, some patients are diagnosed when recurrent events cease during an antiepileptic drug trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

However, the presence of vascular risk factors should raise concern for this diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There are case reports of patients with a clinical syndrome compatible with TGA who had evidence of ischemic stroke on imaging studies with lesions in the mesial temporal lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/39,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,42</a>], caudate nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], cingulate gyrus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], and splenium of the corpus callosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. While the neurologic examination is often reported to be otherwise normal in these cases, visual field abnormalities are common in strokes involving the temporal lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is performed in most cases to exclude TIA.

One study showed that 55 patients, one year after an episode of TGA, had worse performance on tests evaluating memory and attention compared with a group of 80 age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-global-amnesia/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. One-third of the TGA patients met criteria for amnestic mild cognitive impairment.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary site of neurologic functional disturbance is the medial temporal lobe. The pathogenesis of this transient disruption is unknown. Current theories include arterial ischemia, venous congestion, and migraine, but no theory explains all of the clinical features. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The event is characterized by a profound disruption in anterograde memory; patients are typically disoriented to place and will repeatedly ask where they are and why they are there. Retrograde amnesia is variably present. Other cognitive and executive functions are intact. Patients do not lose self-awareness. Resolution typically occurs after several hours. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of TGA are generally distinct from other considerations in the differential diagnosis including stroke, seizure, toxic metabolic encephalopathy, and delirium. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with TGA should be observed until the episode resolves. Investigations should include laboratory tests to exclude intoxication, infection, and metabolic derangements. Brain MRI with DWI is recommended to exclude stroke or other structural causes. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis after TGA is felt to be benign, and the risk of recurrence is low.
