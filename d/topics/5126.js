The vast majority of patients who develop diabetic retinopathy (DR) have no symptoms until the very late stages (by which time it may be too late for effective treatment). Because the rate of progression may be rapid and therapy can be beneficial for both symptom amelioration and reduction in the rate of disease progression, it is important to screen patients with diabetes regularly for the development of retinal disease.</p><p>Issues related to screening for DR will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical findings, natural history, and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Prevention and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for DR is important because the majority of patients who develop DR have no symptoms until macular edema (ME) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) are already present. The efficacy of laser photocoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors in preventing visual loss from PDR and ME is well established in randomized trials. However, these therapies are more beneficial in preventing visual loss than reversing diminished visual acuity. Thus, early detection through screening programs and appropriate referral for therapy are important to preserve vision in individuals with diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Prevention and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">METHOD OF SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the initial screening examination, we prefer evaluation by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is experienced with diagnosing and treating DR. In certain settings (eg, when previous exams have been normal or when there is a shortage of eye care specialists), subsequent examinations can be done with retinal photographs if there is a trained photographer and reader. A comprehensive exam is required for follow-up of abnormalities detected on retinal photographs. These recommendations are consistent with American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Ophthalmoscopy is a reasonable screening method when performed by well-trained personnel on dilated fundi. The accuracy of ophthalmoscopy is substantially lower when performed by primary care physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As an alternative, seven-field stereoscopic fundus photography is another acceptable method but also requires both a trained photographer and a trained reader. Fundal photography compares favorably with ophthalmoscopy (performed by an experienced ophthalmologist, optometrist, and ophthalmic technician) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one study of 1949 patients participating in the Wisconsin Epidemiology Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR), there was almost complete agreement between ophthalmoscopy and the results of fundus photography in 86 percent of cases, with no significant interobserver differences. Of note, the center that conducted the study is an academic center that focuses on diabetic retinopathy. Whether these results are generalizable is unknown.</p><p>The availability of nonmydriatic digital stereoscopic retinal imaging allows remote interpretation by an ophthalmologist, which may improve retinopathy screening in areas with a shortage of eye care specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The examination takes 15 to 20 minutes and does not require dilation of the eyes. When compared with dilated fundoscopic examination or the gold standard seven-field stereoscopic fundus photography for retinopathy screening, digital imaging (three fields) has good sensitivity and specificity for detecting DR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. As an example, in one study comparing digital imaging with dilated fundoscopic examination, there was concordance in 86 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of discordant diagnoses (35 of 46 eyes) were related to a greater frequency of finding mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) with digital images compared with dilated fundoscopic exam. Although there were few cases of macular edema (ME) (six eyes), there was 100 percent concordance between the two modalities. Automated evaluation of digital retinal images using a computer algorithm with the ability to continually learn and update parameters for detecting referable DR shows promise for use in the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING INITIATION AND FREQUENCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">When should screening begin?</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults &ndash; In patients with type 2 diabetes, we suggest an initial comprehensive examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist shortly after the diagnosis of diabetes is made (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61833 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In patients with type 1 diabetes, we suggest an initial comprehensive examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within five years after diagnosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Type 2 diabetes is typically a disease with insidious onset, and some patients already have retinopathy at the time of diagnosis of hyperglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58736\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58736 \">figure 1</a>). In contrast, it is unusual for patients with type 1 diabetes (under age 30 years) to develop retinopathy that requires specific ophthalmologic therapy earlier than five years after the onset of diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70042\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70042 \">figure 2</a>). As an example, in 1613 patients with type 1 diabetes of less than five years' duration who were screened for enrollment in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), 874 had evidence of DR either by fundus photography or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, none had PDR requiring laser treatment, and only six (0.4 percent) had preproliferative retinopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adolescents &ndash; In children with type 1 diabetes, it is unusual to develop retinopathy prior to age 10 years. Initial screening in children and adolescents is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and screening in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Retinopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-and-complications-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities and complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Retinopathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency of examinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of follow-up examinations should be individualized, with more frequent follow-up in patients who have abnormal findings or if retinopathy is progressing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61833 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. Less frequent examinations (every two to three years) may be considered with the advice of an eye care professional in the setting of a normal examination. These recommendations are consistent with American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There are few data evaluating the frequency of follow-up examinations after the initial screening examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. An individualized schedule, rather than annual or biannual screening, may be preferable and more cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong> &ndash; In the Wisconsin Epidemiology Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR), patients with type 2 diabetes and no retinopathy on baseline examination (standard stereoscopic color fundus photographs) did not progress to PDR over four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, patients with a longer duration of diabetes, retinopathy on baseline examination, gross proteinuria, or poor glycemic control were at greater risk of developing PDR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, a cohort study from the United Kingdom found that the incidence of sight-threatening DR (moderate preproliferative retinopathy or worse, or clinically significant macular edema [ME]) in patients with type 2 diabetes with no retinopathy on initial screening was 0.3 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.5) in the first year and 1.8 percent (95% CI 1.2-2.5) in the fifth year, suggesting that screening every three or four years may be adequate in those with normal initial examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Yearly or more frequent screening was required for those with background or preproliferative retinopathy on initial screening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based upon these studies, some health care organizations and auditing groups (such as the National Committee on Quality Assurance) have suggested that those individuals documented to have no DR may be screened every two years. However, it is not clear if the results of the above studies are applicable to all patients with type 2 diabetes. As an example, it should be noted that the WESDR study individuals were white patients of northern European extraction, and some studies suggest racial and ethnic variation in DR (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>). In the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), the prevalence of moderate to severe DR was higher for Hispanics (36 percent) and African Americans (29 percent) than for non-Hispanic whites (22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Furthermore, it is not clear that the standards used in the WESDR study for evaluation of the photographs can be adopted nationwide. Finally, there is greater potential to lose patients to follow-up with less frequent screening intervals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> &ndash; The appearance and progression of retinopathy has been assessed regularly with scheduled fundus photography in patients with type 1 diabetes participating in the DCCT and EDIC (Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications) study, giving rise to a mean 23.5 years of follow-up data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among almost 24,000 retinopathy examinations, 14.5 percent showed worsening from the previous visit, 7.8 percent showed improvement, and 77.7 percent showed no change. Higher A1C levels were associated with a significantly increased risk of worsening retinopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A Markov model was used to calculate the probabilities of transitioning from lower levels of retinopathy with varying screening intervals. The time interval during which patients progressed from lower to higher categories of retinopathy was dependent upon the previous retinal exam and A1C level, with optimal screening intervals ranging from every three months among patients with severe nonproliferative retinopathy to every four years among those who had no retinopathy. This individualized schedule for retinopathy screening resulted in an overall reduction in the frequency of eye examinations and a substantial reduction in cost. These data support an individualized approach to examination intervals.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of pregnancy on the natural history of DR has been addressed in several studies; progression has been observed in 16 to 85 percent of patients, and the rate of progression may be accelerated. This topic is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-classification-and-clinical-features#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Classification and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Worsening during pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>Because pregnancy may exacerbate underlying DR, women with diabetes who are planning pregnancy should have a comprehensive eye examination and be counseled on the risk of development <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression of DR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61833 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregestational diabetes mellitus: Glycemic control during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with diabetes who become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye examination in the first trimester and close follow-up throughout pregnancy and for one year postpartum. This guideline does not apply to women who develop gestational diabetes, as these women are not at increased risk for DR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING IMPACT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two studies have addressed the value of screening for DR in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. They concluded that, in patients with type 1 diabetes, annual screening (ophthalmoscopy with dilated pupils) for those without retinopathy and follow-up every six months for those with retinopathy followed by appropriate treatment would result in a saving of 70,000 to 80,000 person-years of sight and 60 to 80 million US dollars annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Comparable numbers for type 2 diabetes were over 94,000 person-years of sight and over 250 million US dollars per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-screening/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2847743510\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Method of screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with type 1 diabetes, we suggest initiating screening three to five years after diagnosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In patients with type 2 diabetes, we suggest initiating screening soon after the time of diagnosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Screening initiation and frequency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of follow-up examinations should be individualized.

More frequent follow-up is necessary if retinopathy is progressing. Patients with macular edema (ME), severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) should be closely followed by an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of DR. If there is no evidence of retinopathy on initial examination, less frequent examinations (every two to three years) may be adequate.
