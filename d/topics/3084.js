Three of the most common variants, namely spiculated cells (echinocytes and acanthocytes) and target cells, will be discussed here. Other variants such as stomatocytes (hydrocytes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75535 \">picture 1</a>) and xerocytes (dessicocytes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62761 \">picture 2</a>) are discussed separately.

A freshly prepared peripheral blood smear is essential for distinguishing between these cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; wet preparations or scanning electron microscopy may also be useful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echinocytes (also called burr cells) have serrated edges over the entire surface of the cell and often appear crenated in a blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62090\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62090 \">picture 3</a>). Although often confused with acanthocytes, the projections of the red cell membrane are smaller and much more uniform in shape and distribution in echinocytes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acanthocytes (from the Greek acantha &quot;thorn&quot;) have only a few spicules of varying size that project from the cell surface at irregular intervals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80080\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80080 \">picture 4</a>). They appear contracted and dense on stained peripheral blood smears. Spur cells appear to be the extreme form of acanthocytes and are seen in patients with severe liver disease (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Liver disease'</a> below). Spur cells are felt to be acanthocytes remodeled by the spleen, whereby the spicules become more blunt and the associated membrane loss makes the cell more spherocytic (spheroacanthocyte).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The shape of these cells is thought to be related to changes in the organization of cell membrane components. In acanthocytes, this is often due to a defect in the lipid or protein composition of red cell membrane. In a study of patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome, for example, acanthocytes had a greater tendency to form spikes than normal RBCs in an incubation system, indicating their weakness against membrane tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Focal changes in the membrane skeleton appeared to predispose to the acanthocyte phenotype. In one patient echinocytes were present in association with a massive splenic hemangioma and disappeared following splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A hypothesis has been presented that implicates changes in the conformation in Band 3, a major component of the membrane skeleton, as the basis for acanthocyte formation in both congenital and acquired disorders in which these cells are found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, detailed mechanistic explanations for acanthocyte formation are still not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>In comparison, echinocytes are easily produced in vitro and are often produced by a material in the patient's plasma that causes normal red cells to become echinocytic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echinocytes are often found as artifacts on blood smears. They can be produced in vitro by incubation at high pH or in the presence of high calcium concentrations, exposure to glass surfaces, reduced albumin concentrations, and after prolonged storage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echinocytes have been demonstrated in both end-stage renal disease (in which incubation of echinocytic red cells in normal plasma leads to return of the normal discocytic shape) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and in liver disease. In the latter setting, an abnormal high-density lipoprotein binds to receptors on the outer surface of the red cell membrane and induces the characteristic conformational changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with liver disease often have acanthocytes, echinocytes, and target cells on the peripheral blood smear (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Target cells'</a> below)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. These changes are most severe in advanced hepatocellular disease, which may be associated with 20 to 30 percent acanthocytes in the peripheral blood and moderate to severe hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>].</p><p>Spur cells are the extreme form of acanthocytes. They are probably acanthocytes that have been additionally remodeled by an enlarged spleen and considerably enriched in cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Increased red cell membrane proteolytic activity may also contribute to the formation of spur cells, a process that appears to be due in part to a circulating factor that is present in spur cell plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. A small study from Greece suggests that the presence of spur cell anemia in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis predicts for a shortened survival and aids in prioritization of such patients for liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The acanthocyte results from a combination of abnormal surface area-to-volume ratio, the increase in cell membrane cholesterol characteristic of red cells in severe liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], impairment in membrane fluidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and an inability to remove and repair peroxidatively damaged fatty acids in the red cell membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>Accumulated fatty acid damage is a result of the adult red blood cell's inability to synthesize phospholipids de novo. However, the red cell can identify and remove peroxidized fatty acid chains that interfere with normal membrane lipid fluidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When the fatty acid is removed, a lyso-derivative remains. Since these lyso-derivatives are lytic, the missing fatty acid chain must be replaced. To accomplish this, the red cell depends upon its store of acyl groups that exists in the red cell membrane in the form of acylcarnitine. When needed, the fatty acid (acyl group) is transferred to acyl-CoA and the fatty acid is then inserted into the potentially lytic lysophospholipid by the enzyme lysophosphocholine acyl transferase (LAT).</p><p>LAT is inhibited in spur red cells and can also be inhibited by heavily loading red cells with cholesterol in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, the excess red cell cholesterol in liver disease may be the first step in spur cell formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/8,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,15</a>]. The second step involves extensive remodeling of the red cell in the spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>On occasion, spur cell hemolytic anemia is severe enough to necessitate consideration of splenectomy. The operative morbidity in such cases is considerable, because the underlying alcoholism usually produces problems with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, while the severity of the liver disease can cause problems with procoagulants and intolerance to anesthesia. Spur cell anemia resolves after liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>As mentioned above, the pathogenesis of echinocytosis in liver disease appears to be different. An abnormal high-density lipoprotein binds to receptors on the outer surface of the red cell membrane and induces the characteristic conformational changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroacanthocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different inherited movement disorders are associated with the finding of acanthocytosis in the peripheral blood (neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome).

The mechanisms responsible have not been defined but changes in plasma lipids or red cell membrane proteins may be involved. The anemia seen in patients with anorexia nervosa is more often hypoplastic and not hemolytic or related to the changes in red cell morphology.

These patients also have elevations in the plasma unesterified cholesterol concentration because of inhibition of lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) by bile salts; the normal function of LCAT is to esterify cholesterol to cholesterol esters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipoprotein classification, metabolism, and role in atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The central role of abnormal plasma lipids in the formation of target cells has been demonstrated by two in vitro observations: incubation of normal red cells in plasma from patients with obstructive liver disease causes target cells in vitro; and incubation of target cells in normal plasma results in loss of the target appearance. A clinical correlate is the finding in patients with hereditary spherocytosis that the development of obstructive jaundice due to gallstones improves the hemolytic process and normalizes osmotic fragility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In this setting, the increase in membrane surface area due to the abnormal plasma lipid profile normalizes the previously reduced surface area-to-volume ratio due to loss of membrane surface area in the spherocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics#H3991963788\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell membrane: Structure, organization, and dynamics&quot;, section on 'Surface area to volume ratio (SA/V)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Hereditary LCAT deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Target cells are also seen in hereditary LCAT deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disease due to a mutation in the LCAT gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. As in acquired LCAT deficiency (see above), plasma unesterified cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations are increased. Clinical manifestations include a normocytic anemia accompanied by prominent target cell formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>], reduced red cell osmotic fragility, corneal opacities (called fish eye syndrome), low plasma HDL-cholesterol, proteinuria, and chronic renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/51,52,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52,55</a>], but usually not premature atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

The exact mechanism is not defined, although the reduction in red cell lipid content suggests that lipases may be involved. In the first few weeks following splenectomy, target cells appear, reaching levels of 2 to 10 percent. Like most other target cells, membrane lipids are increased, osmotic fragility is reduced, and the mean surface area-to-volume ratio is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells/abstract/56,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,58</a>]. These red cells may eventually lose their excess lipid by conditioning in nonsplenic sites, leading to the gradual disappearance of target cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of morphologic alterations in red cells can be induced by changes in the cell membrane.
