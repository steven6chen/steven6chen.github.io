ALS is the most common form of motor neuron disease. The diagnosis of ALS is based upon clinical criteria that include the presence of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron signs, progression of disease, and the absence of an alternative explanation. There is no single diagnostic test that can confirm or entirely exclude the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.</p><p>Practically speaking, clinicians make the diagnosis of ALS when it is suggested by the history and physical examination, supported by electrodiagnostic studies, and not excluded by neuroimaging and laboratory studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ALS is suggested when there are progressive symptoms consistent with upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction that present in one of four body segments <span class=\"nowrap\">(cranial/bulbar,</span> cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral) followed by spread to other segments over a period of months to years. The course is not relapsing and remitting, but rather is insidiously progressive. Involuntary weight loss and muscle wasting unrelated to nutrition may also occur.</p><p>The signs and symptoms associated with ALS are described in the tables for limb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72454 \">table 1</a>), bulbar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75146 \">table 2</a>), axial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67913 \">table 3</a>) and respiratory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58537 \">table 4</a>) locations.</p><p>In this setting, the diagnosis of ALS is further suggested by an absence of associated neuropathic or radiculopathic pain, sensory loss, sphincter dysfunction, ptosis, or extraocular nerve or muscle dysfunction. While sensory symptoms may occur in 20 to 30 percent of patients with ALS, the sensory examination is usually normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;, section on 'Sensory symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Phenomena considered to exclude the diagnosis of ALS are supranuclear gaze paresis, tremor or other involuntary movements, cerebellar ataxia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and autonomic dysfunction. However, one or more of these features are considered to be part of an ALS-PLUS syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;, section on 'ALS-plus syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Cognitive dysfunction does not exclude the diagnosis of ALS. Frontotemporal executive dysfunction can precede or follow the onset of motor symptoms in up to 40 percent of patients with ALS. In most cases, the symptoms are mild and possibly only detectable with formal cognitive testing. However, overt frontotemporal lobar dementia occurs in approximately 10 percent of patients with ALS, and may be more common in patients with bulbar onset ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Since 5 to 10 percent of ALS cases are related to a genetic mutation (ie, familial ALS or FALS), a thorough family history should be obtained. The family history should emphasize relatives with the diagnosis of ALS but also explore those who may have suffered from a progressive motor disorder not necessarily labeled as ALS. Mutations that cause FALS have been identified in multiple genes, and some of these mutations also cause frontotemporal dementia. Thus, the family history should seek to identify any relatives with the diagnosis of dementia, cognitive decline, a language disorder, personality change, or late onset (eg, age 40s to 60s) psychiatric disease, particularly if labeled as schizophrenia. Because FALS may be also be accompanied by neurologic dysfunction in other systems as part of an 'ALS-plus' syndrome, a family history of parkinsonism or other neurodegenerative disorders may also be informative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;, section on 'ALS-plus syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>It is also essential to determine if one or more family members underwent brain and spinal cord autopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obtained genetic testing, since this information may be invaluable in supporting the diagnosis of familial ALS and may even allow identification of a specific genetic mutation. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of both upper and lower motor neuron signs in multiple segments is required for the diagnosis of ALS.

Lateral plantar stimulation normally produces reflex toe flexion without other leg or foot movement. Triple flexion occurs when plantar stimulation produces reflex great toe extension, flexion of the knee, and flexion of the hip.</p><p>A lack of toe movement with plantar stimulation, the silent toe, may be considered an upper motor neuron sign when the contralateral side demonstrates normal flexor toe movement. Additional manifestations of triple flexion, such as contraction of the tensor fascia lata and other hip flexors, may occur in response to plantar stimulation even if the toe is not upgoing. Absence of an upgoing toe with plantar stimulation when there are multiple other upper motor neuron signs may at times be explained by lower motor neuron weakness of the great toe extensor (extensor hallucis longus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical standard for the diagnosis of ALS is the revised El Escorial World Federation of Neurology criteria, also known as the Airlie House criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62831\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62831 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These criteria allow assignment of diagnostic certainty and were designed for research purposes to ensure appropriate inclusion of patients into clinical trials. The El Escorial criteria have been validated pathologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and interobserver agreement is acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>By the revised El Escorial criteria, diagnosis of ALS requires the presence of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of lower motor neuron degeneration by clinical, electrophysiological, or neuropathological examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of upper motor neuron degeneration by clinical examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive spread of symptoms or signs within a region or to other regions, as determined by history or examination.</p><p/><p>The revised El Escorial criteria require the absence of electrophysiologic and pathologic evidence of other disease processes that might explain the signs of lower <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper motor neuron degeneration, and the absence of neuroimaging evidence of other disease processes that might explain the observed clinical and electrophysiologic signs.</p><p>In 2008, the Awaji ALS criteria were proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], given that approximately 21 percent of patients die from ALS without having ever met the El Escorial criteria for disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Although similar to the revised El Escorial criteria, the newer Awaji criteria differ by allowing electrodiagnostic and clinical criteria for lower motor neuron signs to be combined to determine if a single limb is abnormal, and by permitting fasciculation potentials by needle electromyography to be used as evidence of ongoing denervation in a muscle with evidence of neurogenic change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These changes were expected to improve the sensitivity of the criteria for the diagnosis of ALS without reducing the specificity when compared with the revised El Escorial (Airlie House) criteria. This expectation is supported by a 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies evaluating the accuracy of the Awaji criteria for the diagnosis of ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The pooled sensitivity was higher with the Awaji criteria compared with the revised El Escorial criteria (81 versus 62 percent), while the specificities for both sets of criteria were 98 percent.</p><p>There are other forms of motor neuron disease that are considered variants of ALS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive muscular atrophy is a progressive disorder that is limited to lower motor neurons.

The revised El Escorial criteria consider progressive muscular atrophy as 'suspected ALS.' Patients with progressive muscular atrophy are currently excluded from participation in clinical trials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary lateral sclerosis is a progressive disorder that is clinically limited to the upper motor neurons.

The revised El Escorial criteria do not consider this disorder as part of the schema of ALS. It is notable, however, that patients with clinically isolated upper motor neuron presentation may eventually develop clinical or electromyographic evidence of lower motor neuron abnormalities. This disorder is then referred to as upper motor neuron-onset ALS and may then meet criteria for the diagnosis of ALS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive bulbar palsy is a progressive upper and lower motor neuron disorder of cranial muscles.

In nearly all cases, upper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower motor neuron abnormalities will eventually spread to limb, axial, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory motor neurons and these patients may meet criteria for ALS.

The difference between the latency of the response elicited by cranial versus cervical or cranial versus lumbosacral stimulation is called the central motor conduction time and is a reflection of the integrity of central motor pathways. Slowing of central motor conduction time has been reported in patients with ALS. Another measure, cortical hyperexcitability, may be an early and specific feature of ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) remains a largely experimental technique and is not used routinely for clinical diagnosis.

Conventional MRI is usually normal in ALS, although increased signal in the corticospinal tracts on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and hypointensity of the motor cortex on T2-weighted images has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>Experimental imaging techniques to detect upper motor neuron disease in ALS include magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion-tensor imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides biochemical and metabolic information in the form of a spectrum obtained in a region of interest or in the whole brain.

To properly interpret genetic test results for ALS genes, it is necessary to know whether the person being tested has ALS and whether a mutation in the family has already been identified. The recurrence risk of ALS in a given family (ie, whether or not another family member will develop ALS) is estimated primarily by determining the inheritance pattern.

The upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron involvement may impair limb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72454 \">table 1</a>), bulbar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75146 \">table 2</a>), axial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67913 \">table 3</a>) and respiratory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58537 \">table 4</a>) function. Cognitive change related to frontotemporal dysfunction may be the presenting symptom in a small subset of patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In practical terms, the diagnosis is made when it is suggested by the history and physical examination, supported by electrodiagnostic studies, and not excluded by neuroimaging and laboratory studies. The revised El Escorial criteria for ALS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62831\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62831 \">algorithm 1</a>) allow assignment of diagnostic certainty but were designed for research purposes. The newer Awaji criteria increase sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend electrodiagnostic testing with nerve conduction studies and electromyography in all patients with suspected ALS. Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies are most often normal in ALS, although compound motor action potential amplitudes may be reduced in severely atrophic and denervated muscles. Electromyography typically reveals combined features of acute and chronic denervation in ALS. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Electrodiagnostic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroimaging is used to exclude other possible diagnoses in the evaluation of suspected ALS. In the absence of a contraindication, we recommend MRI evaluation in all segments rostral to the clinical findings; this includes the brain, cervical spine, and thoracic spine when upper motor neuron findings are in the legs. Conventional MRI is usually normal in ALS. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend laboratory testing of blood and urine to exclude alternative diagnoses in patients with suspected motor neuron disease and ALS. We recommend lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis if there is clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or lymphoma, or if there is a rapidly progressive isolated lower motor neuron syndrome. Additional laboratory testing may be required in certain clinical settings. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing is not a routine part of the diagnostic evaluation in ALS but can be helpful in making the diagnosis in familial ALS, which accounts for 5 to 10 percent of all ALS cases. Genetic testing for specific ALS-causing mutations is most useful for establishing the diagnosis (particularly for juvenile or early-stage disease) and for assessing risk among family members of an affected relative with an established genetic cause. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle biopsy is not a routine part of the diagnostic evaluation of ALS but should be performed if there is clinical suspicion of inflammatory myopathy. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Muscle biopsy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of ALS is extensive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64932\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64932 \">table 5</a>). It is of particular importance to exclude multifocal motor neuropathy, cervical radiculomyelopathy, benign fasciculations, inflammatory myopathy, post-polio syndrome, monomelic amyotrophy, myasthenia gravis, and other forms of motor neuron disease in patients with suspected ALS.
