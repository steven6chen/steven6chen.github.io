Early epidemiologic studies using high-dose estrogen found a mean elevation in BP of 3 to <span class=\"nowrap\">6/2</span> to 5 mmHg, with approximately 5 percent of women developing overt hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A subsequent prospective cohort study of over 68,000 women on lower doses of estrogen demonstrated that, as compared with women who had never used oral contraceptives, the age-adjusted relative risk of developing hypertension was 1.5&nbsp;for current use and 1.1 for past use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Development of hypertension is more likely to occur in patients who developed hypertension during a prior pregnancy or who have a family history of hypertension. Although the rise in BP is usually mild, some women will have more significant increases in BP, and hypertensive emergencies may very rarely occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cessation of therapy typically leads to a return of the BP to baseline, but resolution may take many months.</p><p>A newer progestin, drospirenone, has antimineralocorticoid diuretic effects and, when given as part of combined oral contraceptive therapy, appears to blunt the BP-increasing effect of estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose dependence and mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both estrogen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> appear to contribute to BP elevation in a dose-dependent fashion. The 5 percent incidence of hypertension reported in 1988 was largely derived from studies of high-dose therapy in which the estrogen dose was generally 50 to 150 mcg and the progestin dose was 1 to 4 mg. However, current preparations contain less than 35 mcg of estrogen, and many preparations (often known as ultra-low dose) contain less than 20 mcg of estrogen. </p><p>The mechanisms responsible for the hypertensive effect of oral contraceptives are incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be involved since estrogen stimulates the hepatic production of renin substrate (angiotensinogen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but the interaction among estrogen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> and the RAS are complex. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system may also be involved. However, no changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity or systemic hemodynamics were found between young women taking an oral contraceptive and women with natural menstrual cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular consequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main concern with an oral contraceptive-induced rise in BP is the development of persistent hypertension and the corresponding risk of subsequent premature cardiovascular disease. In a meta-analysis of 14 independent studies published from 1980 to 2003, the relative risk of stroke and myocardial infarction was increased twofold in current users of &quot;low-dose&quot; oral contraceptives (defined as less than 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A statistically significant increase in risk for ischemic stroke was also seen with both second- and third-generation oral contraceptive formulations, while a trend toward an enhanced risk for myocardial infarction was noted among third-generation low-dose oral contraceptive users. However, it appears that the absolute (rather than relative) increase in risk is low and is mainly confined to women over the age of 35 years or those who have other risk factors for atherosclerotic events (particularly smoking) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, past rather than current use of oral contraceptives may not be associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Use of oral contraceptives, including low dose, and combinations including drospirenone can significantly increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), particularly among smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Implications for practice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modest reported increases in relative risk of hypertension with oral contraceptive use do not translate into substantial increases in long-term overall mortality. Thus, for most women, the dangers of oral contraceptive use are far outweighed by the multiple benefits of effective contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We agree with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention (CDC) in 2016 that generally suggest avoiding use of combined (estrogen plus progestin) oral contraceptives in the following patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with known hypertension, even if controlled </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with known ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those 35 years of age or older who smoke, particularly if more than 15 cigarettes per day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of DVT or PE, particularly those with a high risk of recurrence</p><p/><p>Estrogen-containing oral contraception should not be initiated or continued in such patients. For most patients with elevated blood pressure or other risk factors for developing hypertension, such as a positive family history, use of oral contraception is safe. However, BP should be monitored carefully after initiation (for example, using home BP monitoring); a significant rise in BP after initiation of oral contraceptives should prompt a discussion with the patient to weigh the risks and benefits of continuing therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3871318945\"><span class=\"h2\">Injected or implanted hormonal contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of non-oral hormonal contraception methods is increasing. These include progesterone-only depot injections and subcutaneous estrogen-containing implants. The effect of these methods on BP may be more modest than with oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]; however, this is not been extensively studied. Thus, we generally do not recommend their use in patients with hypertension, including patients with controlled hypertension. In addition, they should also be used only with great caution in patients with a history of venous thromboembolic disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTMENOPAUSAL HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy (ERT, or HRT when combined with a progestin) consists of much lower estrogen doses than in oral contraceptives. ERT and HRT appear to have a neutral effect on blood pressure (BP), as illustrated by the following observations from large randomized trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is the largest (16,000 women) randomized, placebo-controlled trial that has evaluated the effect of postmenopausal HRT on cardiovascular outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At 5.2 years, hormone replacement produced only a small mean increase (1.5 mmHg) in systolic pressure compared with placebo.

However, because of the increases in coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolic risk demonstrated in the WHI, HRT should <strong>not</strong> be prescribed for the sole indication of cardiovascular protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
