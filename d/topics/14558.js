Pseudofolliculitis barbae most frequently occurs in association with shaving and results from an inflammatory response to the cutaneous entrapment of recently cut, short hairs. </p><p>Pseudofolliculitis barbae typically presents with firm papules and pustules in the beard area. The appearance of the disorder can be cosmetically distressing for affected patients. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, secondary bacterial infection, scarring, and keloid formation are potential complications.</p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of pseudofolliculitis barbae will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1015817\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudofolliculitis barbae is most prevalent in black men. Between 45 and 83 percent of black men and 3 percent of white men who shave facial hair develop pseudofolliculitis barbae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Women who remove facial hair also may develop the condition.</p><p>While the cheeks and neck are the most common sites of pseudofolliculitis, the condition can occur in any hairy area. Individuals who remove hair from sites such as the axilla, pubic area, and legs may develop pseudofolliculitis in these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical findings of pseudofolliculitis result from a cutaneous inflammatory reaction against hair that has penetrated the interfollicular skin. This may occur through two mechanisms: extrafollicular and transfollicular penetration of the skin. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extrafollicular penetration </strong>&ndash; Extrafollicular penetration describes entry of the distal end of a hair into the interfollicular skin after it has already exited the follicular orifice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87582 \">figure 1A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This occurs when the distal end of a hair comes in contact with the surface of the skin. Shaving contributes to extrafollicular penetration by creating short, sharp-ended hairs that are capable of penetrating the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transfollicular penetration </strong>&ndash; Transfollicular penetration occurs when the distal end of a hair penetrates the dermis prior to exiting the follicular orifice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87583\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87583 \">figure 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This event can result from shaving techniques that result in retraction of the cut edge of the hair into the follicle, such as can occur when the skin is stretched during shaving. The use of double-edged or multiple-edged razors also may contribute to transfollicular penetration; the first razor edge pulls the hair upward and the subsequent razor edge cuts the hair, resulting in retraction of the cut hair into the skin after shaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>After entry into the interfollicular skin, the distal end of the hair may penetrate 2 to 3 mm into the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Eventually, continued hair growth leads to the spontaneous release of the embedded distal tip of the hair; this usually occurs within three to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Although shaving is commonly associated with pseudofolliculitis barbae, other hair removal techniques (eg, plucking, waxing) may result in the development of this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The predominance of pseudofolliculitis barbae in black individuals is considered attributable to the prevalence of tightly curled hair in this population. The ends of tightly curled hair have a greater tendency to curve back towards the surface of the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, in individuals with tightly curled hair, the hair follicle sits at an oblique angle to the skin, which may contribute to the formation of sharp-tipped hairs during shaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One study identified a defect in a hair follicle keratin gene (<em>K6hf</em>) as a potential additional risk factor for this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inflammatory response that develops against hair in the interfollicular epidermis and dermis leads to the formation of firm papules at the site of embedded hairs. The papules may be skin-colored, erythematous, or hyperpigmented (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F51138%7EDERM%2F63934\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51138 graphicRef63934 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Loops of hair emerging from the follicular orifice and reentering the skin may be visible on the skin surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76686\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76686 \">picture 2</a>). Pustules may develop as a result of a sterile, acute inflammatory response to embedded hair or as a manifestation of secondary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The extent of involvement varies widely, from patients with fewer than a dozen papules and pustules to those with more than 100 lesions. The anterior neck, mandible, cheeks, and chin are the most common sites for involvement. The lesions often itch, and scratching can lead to bacterial superinfection. Keloidal scarring may develop at sites of involvement in susceptible patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87492034\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae is made based upon the clinical appearance. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87492248\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin biopsies typically are not necessary for the diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae. If a biopsy is performed, intraepidermal neutrophils, foci of abscess formation in the dermis, and granulomatous inflammation with foreign-body giant cells surrounding the tip of the penetrating hair may be detected on histologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87492276\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae includes other conditions that may result in papules or pustules in areas of terminal hair growth. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacterial folliculitis </strong>&ndash; Bacterial folliculitis usually presents as an acute condition with pustules and erythematous papules as the primary features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62916 \">picture 3</a>). This contrasts with the chronic course and firm papules characteristic of pseudofolliculitis barbae. Cultures are useful for diagnosing bacterial folliculitis. In pseudofolliculitis barbae, cultures are usually negative or demonstrate normal skin flora in the absence of secondary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-folliculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious folliculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Traumatic folliculitis </strong>&ndash; Traumatic folliculitis describes transient inflammation of the hair follicle due to irritation from shaving too closely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients present with perifollicular erythematous papules and excoriations. Unlike pseudofolliculitis barbae, the condition usually subsides rapidly (within a few days) if shaving is discontinued.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tinea barbae </strong>&ndash; Dermatophyte infections involving the beard area are referred to as tinea barbae. Patients may present with pustules, inflammatory papules and nodules, or scaly erythematous plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86999%7EDERM%2F87000\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86999 graphicRef87000 \">picture 4A-B</a>). The detection of fungal forms on a potassium hydroxide preparation confirms the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-pustular-skin-lesions#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with pustular skin lesions&quot;, section on 'Tinea barbae'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acne keloidalis nuchae </strong>&ndash; Acne keloidalis nuchae is a hair and scalp disorder that may present with dome-shaped papules, pustules, and keloidal plaques on the occipital scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87490\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87490 \">picture 5</a>). The disorder most commonly occurs in young black men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The location of acne keloidalis on the scalp distinguishes this condition from pseudofolliculitis barbae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cutaneous sarcoidosis </strong>&ndash; Cutaneous sarcoidosis may present with a variety of manifestations, including firm papules or plaques that may be skin-colored, yellow-brown, red-brown, violaceous, or hypopigmented (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73271%7EDERM%2F69405\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73271 graphicRef69405 \">picture 6A-B</a>). Like pseudofolliculitis, sarcoidosis occurs at increased frequency in black patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Unlike pseudofolliculitis barbae, embedded hairs are not a feature of cutaneous sarcoidosis, and lesions may be seen outside of the beard area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-sarcoidosis#H18191778\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1015801\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the clinical manifestations of pseudofolliculitis are a consequence of the entry of hair into the interfollicular skin, the primary approach to therapy consists of measures to prevent this occurrence. Few randomized trials have evaluated interventions for pseudofolliculitis barbae, and the approach to patient management primarily is guided by clinical experience.</p><p>The most effective and safe intervention for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae is the permanent discontinuation of shaving or other hair removal practices that have induced the condition. Patients who are able to do this usually notice significant clinical improvement within a few months. (See <a href=\"#H1015941\" class=\"local\">'Cessation of shaving'</a> below.)</p><p>However, occupational requirements, cultural values, and individual preferences prevent many patients from discontinuing hair removal indefinitely. When feasible, we encourage these patients to discontinue shaving until the condition improves (usually one to six months). Following this, changes in hair removal practices to methods that may reduce the risk for recurrent pseudofolliculitis can be implemented. Patients who are unable to discontinue hair removal for this transient period can implement such measures immediately. (See <a href=\"#H89240656\" class=\"local\">'Alternative hair removal techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>Laser hair removal is an effective treatment option for pseudofolliculitis barbae that works by reducing the density and thickness of hair in treated areas. Patients who are willing to have long-term reduction in the density of hair can attain improvement with this intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1015976\" class=\"local\">'Laser hair removal'</a> below.)</p><p>Topical treatments, such as topical retinoids, low potency topical corticosteroids, topical antimicrobials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eflornithine-united-states-availability-of-intravenous-preparation-limited-to-cdc-and-who-distribution-programs-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eflornithine</a>, and alpha-hydroxy acids, are often used as adjunctive therapy in an attempt to accelerate improvement and reduce the signs and symptoms of pseudofolliculitis barbae. However, data on the efficacy of these therapies are limited. (See <a href=\"#H87492315\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive medical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176530633\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventive measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three major methods for inhibiting the development of pseudofolliculitis barbae are the cessation of shaving, the altering of hair removal practices, and long-term hair reduction with laser therapy. Although the cessation of shaving and long-term hair reduction can lead to the resolution of pseudofolliculitis barbae, the benefit attained from altered hair removal practices is usually limited to improved control of the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1015941\"><span class=\"h3\">Cessation of shaving</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discontinuing shaving, hair waxing, and hair plucking, and allowing the hair to remain at a length that makes penetration of the skin unlikely is the treatment of choice for pseudofolliculitis barbae. Patients may continue to groom the beard with scissors or an electric clipper. We suggest initially trimming the hair to a length of no less than 0.5 cm. If the patient desires, trials of shorter trim lengths can be performed after the patient attains lesion clearance.</p><p>Patients should be cautioned that pseudofolliculitis may continue to progress during the first few weeks after the discontinuation of shaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This occurs due to the continued embedding of previously shaved hairs in the skin. In the interim, the distal tips of visible embedded hairs may be carefully dislodged by the patient with a toothpick, though hair should not be plucked from the follicle because doing so may cause additional irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A low potency topical corticosteroid, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 2.5% cream, can be applied twice daily to inflamed lesions for up to three to four weeks. If secondary infection is present, the patient should be given appropriate antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Depending on the severity of the condition, marked improvement in papules and pustules is usually noted within one to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Associated hyperpigmentation may take several months or longer to resolve. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89240656\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative hair removal techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not want to maintain a beard should attempt to incorporate hair removal methods that may reduce penetration of the interfollicular skin by the hair shaft. As noted above, we prefer to do this after improvement has been attained during an initial period of beard growth (see <a href=\"#H1015801\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above). Patients who decline to discontinue hair removal for several weeks to a few months may try these methods as initial treatment. </p><p>Adjustments to the patient's shaving routine or the use of electric clippers or chemical depilatories instead of razors may be attempted. The choice of intervention is influenced by patient preference. If a particular intervention does not yield favorable results, one of the other approaches may be implemented. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1016168\"><span class=\"h4\">Adjustments to shaving routine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjustments to the shaving routine that may be useful for patients with pseudofolliculitis barbae who desire to continue shaving include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>application</strong> <strong>of generous amounts of a highly lubricating shaving cream or gel for 5 to 10 minutes </strong>prior to shaving softens the hair and may help to reduce the formation of sharp hair tips during shaving. The application of <strong>warm compresses</strong> prior to shaving may also be used to achieve this goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of a <strong>single blade razor</strong> rather than a double-bladed or multiple-bladed razor may help to reduce the production of very short cut hairs that subsequently become embedded in the interfollicular skin. In addition, <strong>shaving should be performed only in the direction of hair growth</strong>. Specialized razors that use a guard system to prevent a very close shave (eg, Bump Fighter razor) may also be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. <strong>Stretching of the skin during shaving should be avoided.</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gentle <strong>washing of the beard area in a circular motion with a mildly abrasive cloth or sponge for a few minutes daily</strong> may help to free embedded hairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some authors have advocated using a magnifying mirror to identify embedded hairs, after which the embedded distal tips can be dislodged with a toothpick or sterile needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. <strong>Plucking of hairs from the follicle should be avoided</strong>, since this may lead to follicular inflammation and the subsequent growth of hair that penetrates the follicular wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1015962\"><span class=\"h4\">Electric clippers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electric clippers can be used to shave hair in a manner that leaves the remaining hair at a greater length than razor shaves. Patients should be encouraged to leave the remaining hair at a length of at least 1 mm to reduce the risk of lesion recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1015969\"><span class=\"h4\">Depilatories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with pseudofolliculitis barbae improve with the replacement of shaving by the use of depilatories, which contain substances such as barium sulfide or calcium thioglycolate and remove hair by inducing the lysis of disulfide bonds in hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Hair removal with depilatories tends to leave the distal ends of hairs with soft, brush-like tips rather than the sharp tips produced by shaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Chemical depilatories are usually applied to the skin for several minutes. Long hair in the treatment area should be clipped prior to use. </p><p>Irritation is a potential side effect of depilatories, and some patients are unable to tolerate these products on facial skin. Patients should test the product on a nonfacial area and follow the site for irritation for 48 hours prior to facial use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If significant irritation occurs, the product should not be used. For patients who use depilatories, limiting the frequency of use to every other day or less may help to minimize irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1016209\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term hair reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because pseudofolliculitis barbae occurs only in areas of hair regrowth, the destruction of hair follicles can lead to improvement in the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Laser hair removal is the preferred method for hair reduction in patients with pseudofolliculitis barbae. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1015976\"><span class=\"h4\">Laser hair removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser hair removal works through selective destruction of hair follicles, and results in a reduction in the density and thickness of hair. Multiple treatment sessions are usually required to achieve a major reduction in hair growth because only a minority of hair follicles are destroyed during each treatment. Since melanin is the follicular component targeted by hair removal lasers, patients with darkly pigmented hairs are the best candidates for this procedure. The treatment is poorly effective for white or gray hairs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H2286670\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Large versus small structures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=removal-of-unwanted-hair#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Removal of unwanted hair&quot;, section on 'Laser and intense pulsed light'</a>.)</p><p>Multiple lasers have demonstrated benefit for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae, including long-pulsed neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>], diode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], alexandrite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and ruby [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] lasers. As an example, in an open study in which 37 men with primarily mild pseudofolliculitis barbae had a 15 x 15 mm area in the submental region treated with one session with a long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser, examination 90 days after treatment revealed that mean papule counts were significantly lower in the treated sites than in adjacent control sites (1.0&plusmn;1.36 versus 6.9&plusmn;5.25, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The value of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eflornithine-united-states-availability-of-intravenous-preparation-limited-to-cdc-and-who-distribution-programs-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eflornithine</a> (an inhibitor of hair growth) as an adjunct to laser therapy was investigated in a split-face randomized trial of 27 men with pseudofolliculitis barbae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the trial, men were treated with a long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. In addition, the patients applied eflornithine 13.9% cream to one side of the face and a placebo cream to the other side of the face twice daily. Throughout the study, the median percentage reduction in hair was significantly greater on the side of the face treated with eflornithine than on the side of the face treated with the placebo cream (99.5 versus 85.0 percent at 16 weeks). Although significantly greater improvement in papular lesions was also noted on the side of the face treated with eflornithine at every study time point, excellent results were attained in both groups and the clinical difference in improvement in papular lesions was negligible after 16 weeks. Studies with longer follow-up are necessary to determine the role of eflornithine in the management of pseudofolliculitis barbae. (See <a href=\"#H87492315\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive medical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Potential risks of laser hair removal include transient or permanent pigmentary changes, blistering, and scarring. The risk for pigmentary abnormalities is greatest in individuals with dark skin. Performing a test spot in an inconspicuous area may reduce the risk for side effects by allowing the clinician to adjust laser settings appropriately prior to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1015984\"><span class=\"h4\">Electrolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrolysis of beard hairs is generally not recommended for pseudofolliculitis barbae since it is painful, tedious, and often unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Exacerbation of pseudofolliculitis barbae is also a concern because failure of the electrolysis needle to reach the hair bulb of a curved hair follicle theoretically could result in an increased risk for subsequent transfollicular penetration during regrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above). Hyperpigmentation at sites of needle insertion and scarring are additional potential adverse effects of electrolysis.

The most common medical therapies utilized for pseudofolliculitis barbae are topical retinoids, low potency topical corticosteroids, and topical antimicrobials (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a>).

Two small uncontrolled studies have documented clinical improvement in patients treated with daily application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-tretinoin-topical-all-trans-retinoic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical tretinoin</a> for several weeks, one of which involved the use of tretinoin in combination with a low potency topical corticosteroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical corticosteroids </strong>&ndash; In addition to use in combination with topical retinoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], low potency topical corticosteroids have been used to treat inflamed lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1015941\" class=\"local\">'Cessation of shaving'</a> above). Due to the potential for adverse effects on the skin, the treatment course is usually limited to less than three to four weeks on a particular area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical antimicrobials </strong>&ndash; Since pseudofolliculitis barbae is not an infectious condition, authors have disagreed on the indications for antimicrobial therapy. While some authors have primarily limited use to the setting of secondary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>], others have used these agents more routinely based upon the idea that antibiotics may reduce skin flora that may aggravate inflammation or lead to secondary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/2,9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,22</a>]. One 10-week, randomized trial comparing the efficacy of a gel containing 5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a> and 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> to a vehicle gel in men using a specialized razor (Bump Fighter razor) for pseudofolliculitis barbae found that the reduction in lesion counts was significantly greater in the active treatment group than in the placebo group at two, four, or six weeks after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, the difference between the groups was no longer statistically significant at week 10. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eflornithine-united-states-availability-of-intravenous-preparation-limited-to-cdc-and-who-distribution-programs-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eflornithine</a><strong> </strong>&ndash; Eflornithine is a topical agent used most commonly for the treatment of unwanted facial hair. The drug slows hair growth by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase. Although the use of this agent has been advocated by some authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/3,21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,24</a>], study data on the efficacy of eflornithine specifically for pseudofolliculitis barbae are limited to a randomized trial in which eflornithine was administered in combination with laser therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1015976\" class=\"local\">'Laser hair removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha hydroxy acids </strong>&ndash; Topical glycolic acid therapy was associated with significantly greater reduction in papules and pustules associated with pseudofolliculitis barbae in two small split-face placebo-controlled randomized trials published by the same investigator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In the first trial (n = 20), the average number of lesions on the side of the face treated with a topical 8% glycolic acid lotion decreased from 27 to 4 after eight weeks, compared with a reduction from 29 to 22 lesions on the placebo-treated side. In the other trial (n = 15), the average number of lesions on the side of the face treated with 8% glycolic acid in a nonlipid soap fell from 32 to 7, compared with a fall from 35 to 21 papules on the placebo-treated side of the face.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rationale for a beneficial response to glycolic acid is uncertain. The author postulated that an effect of glycolic acid on sulfhydryl bonds in the hair shaft could contribute to the growth of straighter hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Additional studies would be useful for confirming the efficacy of glycolic acid therapy.</p><p/><p>In our opinion, the approach to the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae should focus heavily on preventive measures (see <a href=\"#H176530633\" class=\"local\">'Preventive measures'</a> above). The medical therapies reviewed here represent generally well-tolerated options for adjunctive treatment that can be tried to achieve additional benefit. </p><p>Hyperpigmentation commonly occurs in sites of pseudofolliculitis barbae. Topical treatments such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelaic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelaic acid</a>, kojic acid, and chemical peels can be helpful for accelerating improvement in the hyperpigmentation associated with this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Additional treatments that have not been sufficiently evaluated include photodynamic therapy and hormonal therapy. Photodynamic therapy was proposed as a potential treatment based upon a case report describing benefit in a patient with refractory staphylococcal folliculitis barbae and pseudofolliculitis barbae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although a subset of women with PFB may have hormonal abnormalities contributing to facial hair and pseudofolliculitis barbae, the effects of antiandrogenic therapy in women with pseudofolliculitis barbae have not been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865943\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a common disorder that occurs as a result of hair removal in the beard area. The distal ends of regrowing hairs penetrate the interfollicular skin and elicit an inflammatory reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87582%7EDERM%2F87583\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87582 graphicRef87583 \">figure 1A-B</a>). Shaving is a common cause of pseudofolliculitis barbae. Waxing or plucking hairs also may lead to this condition. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with tightly curled hair, such as is prevalent in the black population, are most susceptible to pseudofolliculitis barbae. (See <a href=\"#H1015817\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with pseudofolliculitis barbae typically present with multiple inflammatory papules and pustules in areas of hair removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F51138%7EDERM%2F63934\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51138 graphicRef63934 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Close examination of the affected areas may reveal loops of hair exiting and reentering the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76686\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76686 \">picture 2</a>). Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation may be prominent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with pseudofolliculitis barbae, we suggest discontinuation of shaving or other causative methods of hair removal as first-line treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Discontinuation of shaving often leads to improvement in pseudofolliculitis barbae within a few months. Some degree of improvement in pseudofolliculitis may also be obtained by changing shaving techniques and engaging in alternative hair removal methods. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are willing to undergo laser hair removal can achieve improvement in pseudofolliculitis barbae with this therapy. Electrolysis is not recommended for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae. (See <a href=\"#H1016209\" class=\"local\">'Long-term hair reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive medical therapies, such as topical retinoids, low potency topical corticosteroids, topical antimicrobials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eflornithine-united-states-availability-of-intravenous-preparation-limited-to-cdc-and-who-distribution-programs-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eflornithine</a> hydrochloride, and alpha-hydroxy acids (eg, glycolic acid) have been used for patients with pseudofolliculitis barbae. Although evidence for the efficacy of these agents is limited, they may be useful as adjunctive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H87492315\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive medical therapy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudofolliculitis-barbae/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Coquilla BH, Lewis CW.
