Certain lifestyle and hormonal factors, which increase the risk of disordered bone metabolism, are prevalent in HIV-infected patients. These include physical inactivity, suboptimal intake of calcium and vitamin D, cigarette smoking, alcohol and opiate use, depression, and low testosterone levels. ART itself may be associated with decreased bone mineral density.</p><p>This topic will discuss pathogenesis, prevalence, risk factors, screening, and interventions for patients with bone loss. Topics of HIV and aging are discussed elsewhere. Issues of screening and management of osteoporosis in the general population are discussed separately.

The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as a bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the spine, hip, or forearm that is more than 2.5 standard deviations below that of a &quot;young normal&quot; adult (T-score &lt;-2.5) or a history of one or more fragility fractures. Osteopenia is characterized by low BMD (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) and can be a precursor to osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607984229\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED FRACTURE RATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies suggest that fracture rates are higher in HIV-infected patient populations than among matched uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. A retrospective analysis comparing 8525 patients with HIV and 2,208,792 patients without HIV found an increased fracture prevalence based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coding (2.9 versus 1.9 per 100 persons, p&lt;0.0001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS), a prospective cohort study of 5826 HIV-infected patients in treatment at 10 HIV clinics throughout the United States, age-adjusted fracture rates were 1.98 to 3.69 times higher than rates in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Another cross-sectional study of 222 HIV-infected outpatients and an equal number of age-matched uninfected controls reported more fractures in the HIV group (45 versus 16 fractures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>As in the general population, osteoporosis is a strong risk factor for fracture among HIV-infected individuals. Among 1006 participants in two HIV cohort studies, for example, the presence of osteoporosis was associated with a fourfold increased risk of incident fracture (predominantly of the rib or sternum, hand, foot, and wrist) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As the HIV-infected population ages, prevention of osteoporotic fractures is likely to become a significant therapeutic goal.

Osteopenia was diagnosed in 55 percent of men and 51 percent of women; osteoporosis was diagnosed in 34 percent of men and 8 percent of women. In this cohort, the higher prevalence of low BMD in men than in women may be explained by their slightly older age (median age 43 versus 41 years) and more frequent tobacco use (74 versus 59 percent).</p><p/><p>The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis may be affected by antiretroviral medications, associated body composition changes, duration of HIV infection, chronic illness, and other concomitant risk factors for bone loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR BONE LOSS AND FRACTURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low bone mineral density (BMD) among patients with HIV infection is usually multifactorial, since weight loss, malnutrition, hypogonadism, and malabsorption (leading to vitamin D deficiency) may be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3105688\"><span class=\"h2\">Traditional risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional risk factors for bone loss such as female gender, advanced age, low body mass index (BMI), physical inactivity, steroid use, duration of menopause, smoking, and injection drug use may act in concert with HIV-associated risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Also, the importance of the status of reproductive function was highlighted by a study of 84 normal-weight, HIV-infected women, that reported reduced bone density among women with oligomenorrhea or elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels compared with women with normal menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

However, it is unclear if these rates of vitamin D deficiency are truly higher than in the general population.</p><p>In a study of 270 HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the United States (85 percent men and 61 percent black race), the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (defined as a 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L)</span> was high but not statistically different from that among a matched HIV-uninfected control group (69 versus 59 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency was not associated with low BMD in this cohort. It should be noted, however, that this study reported on a predominantly black population, which may overrepresent vitamin D deficiency. Similarly, the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV and AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN) found that, among 672 participants, 70.3 percent had either vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (defined as 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L)</span> compared with 79.1 percent in the general United States population based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3105695\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the high prevalence of traditional risk factors for bone loss among the HIV-infected population, HIV infection itself may also contribute to bone loss. This has been supported by epidemiologic data and studies of pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Several observational studies have suggested an association between HIV infection and low BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. As an example, in a study of 210 HIV-infected and 264 uninfected individuals, HIV infection was independently associated with reduced femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine BMD after adjusting for demographic factors and BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Additionally, the stage of HIV disease may also modify the risk. In the HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS) of almost 6000 HIV-infected patients, which demonstrated an elevated incidence of fracture among HIV-infected individuals compared with the general population, nadir CD4 cell count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> was associated with a higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Mechanistic studies of bone loss in HIV support these observations. HIV infection leads to chronic T-cell activation and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines that enhance osteoclast activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Furthermore, HIV proteins decrease bone formation by promoting osteoblast apoptosis (programmed cell death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36156172\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis C infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), regardless of the presence of HIV infection, has been associated with reduced BMD as well as increased fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6,7,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,27,28</a>]. In a large cross-sectional study of patients on public health insurance in the United States, the incidence of hip fracture, as assessed by diagnostic coding, was higher among those infected with HCV compared with either uninfected or HIV-monoinfected patients (2.7 versus 1.3 and 2.0 events per 1000 person years, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The highest rate of hip fracture was observed among patients co-infected with both HIV and HCV (3.1 events per 1000 person years). Proposed mechanisms have included alterations in calciotropic and gonadotropic hormone levels and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3596305\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiretroviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have noted a decrease in bone mineral density in HIV-infected patients with exposure to ART, particularly with certain agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> [TDF]), but the actual effect on fracture rate is modest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H737595112\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone mineral density</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H619806087\"><span class=\"h4\">Effect of ART exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies have indicated an increased rate of bone loss with exposure to ART. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of these BMD declines, although the presence of frank osteoporosis by BMD level is a strong risk factor for fracture.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 10 studies comparing ART-na&iuml;ve (n = 202) with ART-treated (n = 824) patients, there was a 2.5-fold increase in the odds of low BMD in ART-exposed patients; however, most of these studies did not adjust for HIV disease severity or duration of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Studies published subsequent to this meta-analysis further suggest that initiation of ART induces a marked loss of BMD ranging from 2 to 6 percent within the first 48 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>].</p><p>Other studies have suggested that traditional risk factors and duration of HIV infection may contribute more to decreased bone density than ART exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13,18,22,34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18,22,34-37</a>]. Some of these studies, however, include patients treated before TDF was introduced in 2001. In a cross-sectional study of 142 study participants, osteopenia and osteoporosis were demonstrated more frequently in HIV-infected patients compared with HIV-uninfected controls. However, there were no differences in bone density among HIV-infected patients who were treatment-na&iuml;ve or treatment-experienced, regardless of regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Similarly, in a cohort of women greater than 40 years of age, the majority of whom had used illicit drugs, those with HIV infection had reduced BMD in the femoral neck and spine, independent of antiretroviral exposure, when compared with controls. Significant risk factors included non-black race, low weight, and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262114162\"><span class=\"h4\">Effect of specific ART drugs</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> &mdash; The initiation of TDF-containing ART regimens has been shown to lead to initial, modest bone loss that subsequently stabilizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15,31,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,31,38-41</a>]. As an example, in a randomized trial of either TDF or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, patients in the tenofovir arm had a significantly greater percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at 48 weeks compared with those in the stavudine arm.

Similarly, in the STEAL trial of 357 virologically suppressed patients, those who switched to TDF-containing ART had greater bone loss at 48 and 96 weeks compared with those patients who were switched to abacavir-based ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. TDF-containing regimens were also associated with more bone loss than maraviroc-containing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, a different formulation of tenofovir, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (TAF), is associated with less effect on bones than TDF. In several randomized trials of patients initiating therapy with either a TAF or TDF-containing regimen, those receiving TAF had smaller BMD decreases at the spine and hip at 48 weeks compared with TDF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

The rate of fractures and &gt;5 percent decreases in BMD were also higher with TDF but were overall rare in both treatment arms. In subsequent trials, switching from a TDF regimen to a TAF regimen resulted in improvements in BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

Some experts, however, have suggested avoiding both TDF and boosted-protease inhibitors in patients at high risk for fragility fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Studies that evaluated switching TDF-containing to TAF-containing regimens have demonstrated modest benefits to BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Whether these translate into long-term benefits in fracture incidence is unknown. In a trial of 1436 HIV-infected patients virally suppressed on a TDF-containing regimen, BMD values at 48 weeks were higher among those randomly assigned to switch to a TAF-containing regimen compared with those who remained on TDF (percent change difference of 1.8 and 2.0 percent for hip and spine, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Improvements in BMD were noted in both patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate GFR (eGFR) of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and those with renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 69 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Virologic suppression with the TAF regimen was at least as high as with TDF.</p><p>Studies evaluating switching from TDF to other agents have not demonstrated clear benefits to BMD. A small, randomized pilot study that assessed changes in BMD among patients on TDF with osteopenia or osteoporosis who were randomly switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> or maintained on TDF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. At 48 weeks, there was slight improvement in femoral neck BMD from baseline among those who switched to abacavir but no significant difference between groups.</p><p>Studies evaluating switching from a protease inhibitor-based regimen have not demonstrated benefits to BMD. In one small study that evaluated 18 patients who switched from a protease inhibitor-based regimen to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimen, no improvements in BMD were observed on dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning after 48 weeks of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602298461\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF BONE LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As for the general population, measures to prevent osteoporosis in HIV-infected individuals include maintaining adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, engaging in physical activity (but not to excess), avoiding cigarette smoking, and limiting alcohol intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite their excess risk for bone loss, a need for high vitamin D intake to prevent bone loss in HIV-infected individuals has not been established. One trial evaluated the effects of high-dose vitamin D (4000 international units) and 1000 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> supplementation among 167 predominantly male antiretroviral-na&iuml;ve individuals with normal baseline bone density who were initiating efavirenz-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-emtricitabine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Those randomly assigned to receive high-dose supplementation had slightly less bone loss at the hip and lumbar spine after 48 weeks compared with those assigned to placebo. However, the estimated baseline daily vitamin D intake was low in both groups (median 120 and 137 international units), and with only placebo as a comparator it is unclear if similar effects could have been achieved with lower-dose supplementation.</p><p>Bisphosphonate administration appears to be protective of antiretroviral-associated bone loss, but this strategy is of uncertain clinical benefit and not recommended at this time. In a trial of 63 treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected individuals who were initiating treatment with TDF, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a>, markers of bone resorption were lower and bone mineral density (BMD) was slightly higher at 48 weeks after a single infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> versus placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Given this study population's young age (average 39 years), normal baseline BMD, and short follow-up, it is unclear whether this modest BMD change will be sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> will prevent fracture. Given the potential for adverse effects of long-term use of bisphosphonates, we favor deferring pharmacologic intervention until the risk of fracture warrants it.
