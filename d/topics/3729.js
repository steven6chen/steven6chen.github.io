Its presentation varies, and often patients, especially young children, do not present with the classic acute onset of flank pain commonly seen in adults. As a result, children are frequently evaluated for other conditions before the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is made. The clinical features and diagnosis of childhood nephrolithiasis will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, risk factors, acute management, and prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for nephrolithiasis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute management of nephrolithiasis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with nephrolithiasis present symptomatically, usually with flank or abdominal pain. Approximately 15 to 20 percent are asymptomatic, primarily young children who are diagnosed because of stone detection when abdominal imaging is performed for other purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>In those with symptomatic presentation, the most common symptom is pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Other potential manifestations include gross hematuria, dysuria and urgency, and <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain can be located either as abdominal or flank pain (referred to as renal colic). In several case series, pain was the presenting complaint in 50 to 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>Pain frequency varies with age. In one report, for example, pain was present in 60, 40, and 20 percent of adolescents, school-aged children, and children below five years of age, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The age-related difference in pain may be related to stone location at presentation. Younger children (ie, less than five years of age) are much less likely to have ureteral stones than school-aged children and adolescents (32 versus 64 and 82 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Ureteral stones are generally painful, since they cause ureteral obstruction, whereas kidney stones are often asymptomatic and may be diagnosed as an incidental finding on abdominal imaging.</p><p>Similar to adults with nephrolithiasis, the intensity of pain can vary from a mild ache to severe debilitating pain. In children below five years of age, the pain, if present, appears to be milder and is nonspecific. In addition, young children often are unable to articulate the location and severity of the pain. As a result, young children are frequently evaluated for other causes of abdominal pain before the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is made.</p><p>In addition, nephrolithiasis may be the cause of recurrent abdominal pain in children, as illustrated by a retrospective study that included patients that required hospitalization or underwent appendectomy for abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In pediatric case series, gross hematuria as a presenting symptom for nephrolithiasis varied from 30 to 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

In some cases, urinary tract infection is present and is a contributing factor to stone formation, especially in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>]. In other cases, dysuria and urgency can be seen when the stone is present in the bladder or urethra without an associated UTI.

Younger children are also more likely than older children to have a renal rather than a ureteral stone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. In one of the largest case series, abdominal pain and gross hematuria were the presenting symptoms in approximately one-half of the children below six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

It is confirmed by the detection of a stone on imaging studies or retrieval of a passed stone. As previously mentioned, the diagnosis is made as an incidental finding in approximately 15 to 20 percent of pediatric cases when abdominal imaging is performed for other purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three imaging modalities currently used to diagnosis nephrolithiasis in children are non-contrast helical computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, and plain abdominal radiography. CT is the most sensitive for the detection of renal stones, followed by ultrasonography and plain radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, ultrasonography is the recommended initial imaging modality because of concerns about radiation exposure from CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is the recommended primary imaging modality for suspected nephrolithiasis, as it is effective in detection of renal and ureteral stones while avoiding radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Ultrasonography can detect radiolucent stones, such as uric acid stones, and urinary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, it is limited in its ability to uncover small stones (eg, less than 5 mm), papillary or calyceal stones, or ureteral stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>].</p><p>The experience and expertise of the ultrasonographer is an important factor in the sensitivity of the study, especially in the accurate detection of small stones or ureteral stones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-contrast helical CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to in adults, non-contrast helical CT is the most sensitive modality to detect renal or ureteral stones in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F69052%7ERADIOL%2F72669\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69052 graphicRef72669 \">image 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/10,11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,17</a>]. CT can detect stones in the following conditions, which may not be detected by the other modalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureteral stones, which may not be detected by ultrasonography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiolucent stones (eg, pure uric acid stones), which are not detected by plain radiography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small (ie, 1 mm in diameter) stones, which are not detected by ultrasonography or plain radiography</p><p/><p>CT also provides more detailed anatomic information including detection of obstruction or a structural abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>CT is a rapid procedure requiring less than two minutes to be performed. Patients who undergo CT generally do not require anesthesia. If necessary, contrast can be given after non-contrast images have been obtained to provide additional anatomic detail, such as subtle signs of urinary obstruction or increased detail of an anatomic abnormality.</p><p>While CT scan is the most sensitive imaging modality, the exposure to radiation raises concerns about its use as the initial imaging modality. The radiation exposure during CT varies with different equipment and institutional protocols. Concerns have been raised that small children can be exposed to excessive radiation, if conventional adult radiation doses are used during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19</a>]. However, radiation doses can be significantly reduced through adjusting scanning parameters to the size and weight of the child while still maintaining adequate imaging quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In institutions that provide care for children, protocols to ensure effective and safe radiation doses for CT should be implemented as outlined by guidelines from the National Cancer Institute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal plain radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A plain abdominal radiograph will detect radiopaque stones (eg, calcium, struvite, and cystine stones) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F62009\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62009 \">image 2</a>), but will miss radiolucent stones (eg, uric acid stones), may miss small stones or those that overlay bony structures, and will not detect urinary obstruction. In settings where renal ultrasonography and CT are not available in children, plain abdominal radiography remains a reasonable alternative, recognizing that the reported sensitivity of this study is approximately 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend ultrasound in the initial diagnostic evaluation of pediatric nephrolithiasis. Ultrasonography is preferred to plain film since it is a more sensitive test and can also detect radiolucent stones and urinary tract obstruction. If CT is used as part of subsequent evaluations, radiation doses are adjusted to the size and weight of the child to reduce the radiation exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis in a child with suspected nephrolithiasis depends upon the presenting symptoms. Nephrolithiasis is differentiated from the other conditions by demonstration by imaging of a stone within the kidney or urinary tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal or flank pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints in children and the differential is extensive. Infections, such as gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections (UTI), appendicitis, and pneumonia, are the most common cause of abdominal or flank pain. Other signs and symptoms, most commonly fever, usually distinguish them from nephrolithiasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, the most commonly identified causes for gross hematuria include UTI, irritation of the meatus or perineum, and trauma. These are differentiated from nephrolithiasis by the history and physical examination. Glomerular disease, such as postinfectious glomerulonephritis, is a less common cause of gross hematuria that is distinguished from nephrolithiasis by cola-colored urine instead of red urine, examination of the urinary sediment, and the possible presence of hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of gross hematuria in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the symptoms associated with nephrolithiasis (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/flank</span> pain, gross hematuria, dysuria, and urgency) can also be seen in children with UTI. In addition, the two conditions can present concomitantly with the UTI contributing to the process of stone formation.</p><p>Children with UTI diagnosed by urine culture usually begin to show clinical improvement within 24 to 48 hours of initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. If the clinical condition worsens or fails to improve as expected within 24 to 48 hours of the start of antimicrobial therapy, imaging should be performed to determine if the failed or slow response to therapy is due to the presence of renal stone, renal abscess, or underlying anatomic abnormalities or obstruction.

However, 15 to 20 percent of children are asymptomatic and are diagnosed because of stone detection when abdominal imaging is performed for other purposes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal or flank pain as a presenting symptom varies in intensity from a mild ache to severe debilitating pain. Pain is a common feature in adolescents and school-aged children with nephrolithiasis, but is only present in approximately half of the children below six years of age. Urinary tract infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an incidental finding of a stone on imaging are the presenting findings in almost half of the children below six years of age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of a child with suspected nephrolithiasis includes the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History focusing on underlying risk factors for stone formation (eg, family history, renal and urinary tract structural abnormalities, metabolic disorders, or recurrent urinary tract infection). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for nephrolithiasis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Physical examination that includes measurement of blood pressure and growth parameters, and abdominal examination for signs of urinary obstruction or another cause of abdominal pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urinalysis, urine culture, and measurement of serum creatinine. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is made by the detection of a renal stone by imaging studies or retrieval of a passed stone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend abdominal imaging for any child suspected to have nephrolithiasis. In most patients, we recommend ultrasound as the first line of imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ultrasonography detects radiolucent stones and urinary obstruction and remains the overall imaging choice for when radiation should be avoided, such as in pregnant adolescents. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Computed tomography does provide the greatest sensitivity of the available imaging modalities, but consideration of radiation exposure is important. If CT is needed, it is important that radiation doses be adjusted to the size and weight of the child to reduce radiation exposure.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gearhart JP, Herzberg GZ, Jeffs RD.
