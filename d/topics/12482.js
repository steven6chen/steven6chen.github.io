Neutropenia is also a common manifestation of bone marrow defects associated with reductions in red cells and platelets, such as aplastic anemia, leukemia, myelodysplasia, megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, and the administration of chemotherapy. These disorders are reviewed separately.</p><p>Laboratory evaluation of neutropenia and neutrophil function, as well as various disorders associated with neutropenia are discussed separately.

An ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1500/microL</span> (&lt;1.5 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> is the generally accepted definition of neutropenia for adults, as well as the threshold for neutrophil toxicity and infectious risk following chemotherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The normal range for the ANC varies somewhat with age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105415\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105415 \">table 2</a>). The lower limit of normal is <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> (5.0&times;10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> for the first week of life, then falls to <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span> (1.0&times;10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> between two weeks and one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Neutropenia is often categorized as mild, moderate or severe, based upon the level of ANC. Mild neutropenia corresponds to an absolute neutrophil count between 1000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/microL,</span> moderate between 500 and <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL,</span> and severe with less than <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL</span>. The risk of infection begins to increase at an ANC below <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903 \">table 1</a>). However, the risk is also dependent upon the adequacy of the marrow reserve pool of granulocytes. (See <a href=\"#H2412659\" class=\"local\">'Infection propensity'</a> below.)</p><p>Leukopenia and granulocytopenia are generally used interchangeably with neutropenia, although they are somewhat different:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukopenia refers to a low total white blood cell count that may be due to any cause (eg, lymphopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neutropenia); however, almost all leukopenic patients are neutropenic since the number of neutrophils is so much larger than the number of lymphocytes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Granulocytopenia refers to a reduced absolute number of all circulating cells of the granulocyte series (eg, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils); however, almost all granulocytopenic patients are neutropenic since the number of neutrophils is so much larger than the number of eosinophils and basophils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agranulocytosis literally means the absence of granulocytes, but the term is often incorrectly used to indicate severe neutropenia (ie, ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412651\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPENSITY TO INFECTION AND SIGNIFICANCE OF NEUTROPENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two fundamental issues to consider in the neutropenic patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient at increased risk for infection because of neutropenia?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the presence of neutropenia indicate a serious underlying disorder that is secondarily affecting the neutrophil count?</p><p/><p>Since most physicians' exposure to neutropenia is through experience with malignancy or severe marrow failure syndromes, it is important to point out that, for most commonly encountered cases of neutropenia, the patient's propensity to infection may have little relation to the degree of neutropenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412659\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection propensity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only about 3 percent of the body's neutrophils are circulating in the peripheral blood. The vast majority of neutrophils are in the bone marrow reserve pool and the remainder is in the tissue and marginated pool attached to the lining of blood vessels. Thus, a standard complete blood count (CBC) done on peripheral blood is, in effect, sampling the very smallest compartment of neutrophils and does not accurately reflect the body's capacity to protect against bacterial infection. The most important issue is whether adequate neutrophils get to the site of infection, not how many are sampled en route from the marrow to the tissue. While one can infer tissue supply of neutrophils from the clinical history and certain physical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62992 \">table 3</a>), there is no good clinical laboratory test available to quantitate tissue neutrophil delivery. </p><p>Adequacy of the marrow reserve pool is the most critical determinant of propensity to infection in a neutropenic patient, although having a normal marrow does not guarantee protection against infection (see below). By &quot;adequate marrow reserve&quot; we mean normal marrow cellularity and normal maturation of the neutrophil series. We would consider low marrow cellularity or myeloid arrest at the myelocyte or metamyelocyte stage to imply decreased reserve. The risk of infection based on ANC is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71724 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>In the neutropenic febrile patient, management decisions must be made without information about the adequacy of the bone marrow reserve. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are the only ways to directly evaluate marrow reserve. The table lists clinical signs that infer marrow reserve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62992 \">table 3</a>). If the bone marrow reserve pool is significantly depleted, there is a rough relationship between the absolute neutrophil count and propensity to infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>However, and importantly, if the bone marrow reserve pool is completely adequate, there is no relationship between the degree of neutropenia and propensity to infection. If the marrow reserve pool is normal, patients with an ANC of zero may be at no increased risk of serious infection because of the neutropenia. Essentially, patients with normal marrow reserve are able to deliver neutrophils to the site of infection, and those with no marrow reserve are not.</p><p>Most physicians are aware of the extreme danger present in patients with significant fever and very low absolute neutrophil counts based upon their experiences during training with patients who have received chemotherapy or who have bone marrow failure syndromes. These patients have no bone marrow reserve. Patients with immune mediated neutropenia but normal bone marrow reserve are on the other end of the spectrum and are at no increased risk of infection because of the neutropenia. Note that we are careful to say &quot;no increased risk of infection because of the neutropenia&quot; and not &quot;no increased risk of infection&quot;. Neutropenia can be the presenting finding in common variable immunodeficiency, other immunodeficiency states, and collagen vascular diseases, all of which can have adequate marrow reserve yet put the patient at increased risk for infection for reasons other than the neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Various neutropenia syndromes are presented in the table according to marrow reserve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71724 \">table 4</a>). Some disorders appear in more than one category. For example, post-infectious neutropenia usually has normal marrow reserve, but not always. Classification of neutropenias by marrow reserve status offers a mechanistic link to propensity to infection and has some bearing on treatment. Patients with decreased reserve are likely to benefit from treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor, whereas this agent is not of benefit for patients with normal marrow. The clinical symptoms noted in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62992 \">table 3</a>) can give the clinician some idea of the ability to deliver neutrophils to tissue and thus adequacy of marrow reserve. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a neutropenic patient has a frank abscess or purulent exudate, he or she can get neutrophils to tissue and likely has a normal marrow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of mucosal ulcerations and severe gingivitis suggests inability to deliver neutrophils. However, immune disorders can directly cause similar lesions in the presence of normal reserve neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune neutropenia&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412809\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance of neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Separate from the issue of propensity to infection, neutropenia can be a sign of an underlying systemic disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69186\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69186 \">table 5</a>). When neutropenia is discovered during the evaluation of a febrile patient, propensity to infection dominates. However, neutropenia is often discovered on a blood count done for some other reason.

Neutropenia results from four basic mechanisms: decreased production, ineffective granulopoiesis, shift of circulating PMNs to vascular endothelium or tissue pools, or enhanced peripheral destruction. Confirmation of one of these mechanisms requires leukokinetic studies employing bone marrow cultures, radionuclide tagging of blood PMNs, and other monitoring devices not readily available outside the research laboratory. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia#H1006820\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>The classification of neutropenia according to marrow reserve status is useful when thinking about mechanism of neutropenia and propensity to infection. However, classification based on whether the neutropenia is acquired or congenital and grouped by known causes or associations provides a practical means to approach the differential diagnosis of these disorders in a clinical setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69186\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69186 \">table 5</a>). That said, there is great overlap in the disorders listed, which is why we favor a classification based on marrow reserve. There are several named disorders that lead to neutropenia with normal cellularity, late myeloid arrest, and little or no propensity to infection. These likely represent various interactions between subtle genetic differences and environmental factors. Apoptosis of marrow precursors is now recognized as a common mechanism for many acquired and congenital neutropenias. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired neutropenias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many acquired causes of neutropenia, with infection, drugs, and immune disorders being the most common. As with all neutropenias, the danger to the patient depends on the marrow status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71724 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Postinfectious neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious neutropenias may represent the most common cause of acquired isolated neutropenia. A number of bacterial, viral, parasitic and rickettsial infections are responsible. In most instances, particularly with viral infections, the neutropenia is short-lived and rarely results in bacterial superinfection. Mechanisms include redistribution, sequestration and aggregation, and destruction by circulating antibodies. Hepatitis B virus, Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus can be associated with more severe and protracted neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-causes-of-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious causes of neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-induced neutropenia occurs as an adverse idiosyncratic reaction and is the second most common cause of neutropenia. The true incidence of drug-induced neutropenia is not known; the reported incidence of the rare, more severe, agranulocytosis ranges from approximately 1 to 10 cases per million population per year. The usual definition excludes known cytotoxic agents and requires that the drug have been administered within four weeks of the onset of neutropenia. The drugs with the highest risk of inducing severe neutropenia include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, the thionamides (antithyroid drugs), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65507 \">table 6</a>). These drugs appear to cause neutropenia either by immune-mediated destruction of circulating neutrophils by drug-dependent or drug-induced antibodies or by direct toxic effects upon marrow granulocytic precursors.

Dietary deficiency of these vitamins is relatively uncommon in children and adolescents. However, the diagnosis should be thought of in chronically ill children, especially if they have frequent or prolonged hospitalizations or have malabsorption syndromes including short gut. The diagnosis should not be excluded simply because patients are receiving vitamins in parenteral nutrition solutions. The actual requirements for these vitamins are not known in critically ill patients, so it is best to monitor for deficiency. B12 deficiency can also be seen in exclusively breastfed infants of mothers who have B12 deficiency. Diagnosis of B12 deficiency is particularly important because severe developmental delay can occur if severe B12 deficiency is not treated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">B12 and folate deficiency are best detected by measuring methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HcY). Both are elevated with B12 deficiency, and HcY alone is elevated in folate deficiency. This is important because serum levels of B12 and folate can be normal in the face of deficiency as detected by MMA and HcY [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

While not often thought of, it is not uncommon in children with short gut syndromes receiving parenteral nutrition, patients with malabsorption, and post-gastric bypass surgery. It can cause a marrow picture indistinguishable from myelodysplasia. Particularly in young children completely supported via parenteral nutrition, copper is often removed from the intravenous solution and not reintroduced, leading to deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Critically ill patients who have prolonged hospitalizations should be screened for these deficiencies if they present with neutropenia, even if they are receiving parenteral nutrition.

Immune neutropenia can occur as a myeloid specific syndrome or in association with other cytopenias. Antineutrophil antibodies are involved in the pathophysiology of the neutropenia caused by some infections, drug exposure, and immune deficiencies. In addition, there are specific primary immune disorders characterized by neutropenia and antineutrophil antibody production.</p><p>Assessment of immune neutropenias can be particularly problematic because the propensity to infection may be more related to the underlying immune disorder than to the neutropenia. Thus, while immune disorders may have antibody-mediated neutropenia, they may also be associated with vasculitis, leading to mucosal ulcers. We have seen the oral symptoms completely resolve with treatment of the underlying vasculitis with no change in the ANC, proving that the mucositis and the neutropenia are not related.

Most infants have only mild neutropenia with a mean duration of seven weeks, but moderate to severe neutropenia can also occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Transient neutropenia in newborns is due to transplacental passage of antibodies of broad specificity from women with past or present autoimmune neutropenia. The neutropenia is usually mild and disappears after a few weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic autoimmune neutropenia</strong> &ndash; Autoimmune neutropenia occurs primarily in infants and children under age four and is also called chronic benign neutropenia of infancy and childhood. Most patients present with recurrent infections. Specific treatment of neutropenia is not required. Many patients remain free of infections and maintain a normal lifestyle with no or minimal medical intervention. Spontaneous remission with disappearance of autoantibodies is common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic idiopathic neutropenia</strong> &ndash; The term chronic idiopathic neutropenia, also known as benign chronic neutropenia, is used to describe chronic neutropenia for which there is no obvious cause. In contrast to autoimmune neutropenia, which is primarily a disease of infants and young children, chronic idiopathic neutropenia tends to occur in late childhood or adulthood and does not undergo spontaneous remission. Serologic abnormalities and evidence of antibody production have been found in 30 to 40 percent. These patients most often have a benign course despite the degree of neutropenia. The presence of normal marrow reserve may explain the lack of significant infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-neutropenia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Chronic idiopathic neutropenia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pure white cell aplasia</strong> &ndash; Pure white cell aplasia is a rare disorder characterized by complete disappearance of granulocytopoietic tissue from the bone marrow. It is often associated with thymoma and is due to the presence of antibody mediated GM-CFU inhibitory activity. Such individuals have no marrow reserve and are at risk for infection because of the neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-neutropenia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Pure white cell aplasia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other autoimmune disorders</strong> &ndash; Other immune disorders that are associated with neutropenia include T-gamma lymphocytosis (large granular lymphocyte syndrome) and Felty's syndrome. In the former disorder, there is infiltration of the bone marrow with large granular lymphocytes (LGL), most often due to a clonal expansion of cytotoxic T-cells and often associated with rheumatoid arthritis. LGL disease has markedly decreased marrow reserve as well as autoimmune vasculitic components. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Large granular lymphocyte leukemia in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of large granular lymphocyte leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complement activation</strong> &ndash; The exposure of blood to artificial membranes, as in dialysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may result in complement activation in vivo. The complement is typically produced by the classic complement activation pathway and induces neutrophil aggregation and adherence to endothelial surfaces, often in the lung. Neutropenia and cardiopulmonary symptoms typically occur shortly after exposure to the membrane. This complication can be prevented during hemodialysis by using biocompatible membranes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactions-to-the-hemodialysis-membrane\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactions to the hemodialysis membrane&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypersplenism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enlargement of the spleen from any etiology can result in neutropenia, due to splenic trapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The severity of neutropenia is related to the size of the spleen and rarely is sufficient to result in severe infection. Anecdotal information is available indicating the ability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to improve absolute neutrophil counts in patients with severe hypersplenism-associated neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, this treatment is not indicated in this situation and has been associated with splenic enlargement and rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In most cases, such as aplastic anemia, the leukemias, myelodysplasia, and postchemotherapy, the neutropenia is not an isolated defect, and is associated with varying degrees of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Examination of the peripheral smear and a bone marrow aspirate with biopsy are indicated when more than one cell line is involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital neutropenias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rare primary neutropenias occur and, when associated with severe recurrent infections as in the severe congenital neutropenias, can be treated successfully with hematopoietic growth factors. These syndromes include severe infantile agranulocytosis, myelokathexis, Shwachman-Diamond-Oski syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and reticular dysgenesis. The diagnosis is made by examination of the bone marrow, which reveals myeloid hypoplasia. Congenital neutropenia can also be seen with certain inborn errors of metabolism such as glycogen storage disease and with some of the primary immune deficiency states. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital neutropenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shwachman-diamond-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shwachman-Diamond syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cyclic neutropenia is characterized by recurrent mouth infections and regular oscillations in the numbers of blood neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, lymphocytes and reticulocytes at approximately 21-day intervals. It usually presents in childhood, as a familial syndrome, but there is a subset of patients with onset in adulthood. Treatment is largely supportive and G-CSF has been effective in preventing infection and reducing symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclic-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclic neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Myeloperoxidase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many clinical laboratories, neutrophils are identified on the white blood cell differential by virtue of their positivity for myeloperoxidase. Patients with myeloperoxidase deficiency may then be erroneously considered as having severe neutropenia. This subject is discussed separately.

However, the classic signs of infection may be less evident in patients with neutropenia. This is particularly true in patients with bone marrow hypoplasia who are unable to respond to infection. In this setting, radiographs may not demonstrate pneumonia, or the patient may not exhibit abnormal tenderness with an early ruptured viscus.</p><p>The propensity to infection in neutropenic patients has been discussed and is related to the degree of neutropenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903 \">table 1</a>) and the cause of the neutropenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71724 \">table 4</a>). Common sites of infection include the oral cavity and mucous membranes, the skin, and, with severe, persistent neutropenia, systemic infections of the lungs and bloodstream may occur. Endogenous bacterial flora are the most common pathogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a classic study in patients with leukemia published in 1966, which applies to neutropenia with decreased marrow reserve, the relationship between the frequency of infection and both the severity and duration of neutropenia was evaluated during 733 episodes of moderate neutropenia (ANC less than <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL)</span> and 125 episodes of severe neutropenia (ANC less than <span class=\"nowrap\">100/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Identified infections occurred in 80 percent of patients with severe neutropenia within two weeks of onset and in 100 percent at three weeks.</p><p>These relationships can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL</span> due to chemotherapy, marrow failure, or marrow exhaustion are at high risk for overwhelming bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. This is particularly true in cancer patients with an ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100/microL</span> for more than five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The source of microbial invasion of the blood is chemotherapy-induced mucositis and breaks in the gastrointestinal lining.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efforts have been made to identify febrile neutropenic patients with a lower risk of bacteremia. In one pediatric study of 161 patients experiencing 509 episodes of fever and neutropenia, presentation with chills or hypotension, the requirement for fluid resuscitation, or the diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma were associated with a higher probability of positive blood cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Children without initial signs of sepsis whose fever resolved on antibiotic therapy and whose ANC was <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;100/microL</span> after a 48-hour period in hospital had a low risk of complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk is lower in patients with AIDS who may develop neutropenia in whom drug toxicity or autoimmunity may be responsible for the neutropenia. The risk for bacterial infection becomes significant when the ANC is less than 750 to <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In one series of 2047 HIV-infected patients, the risk for developing a bacterial infection requiring hospitalization occurred at ANCs below <span class=\"nowrap\">750/microL</span> and increased progressively as the ANC fell below this level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61584\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61584 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Similarly, some adults with immune neutropenia have severe depression of the ANC but never suffer episodes of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In both situations, the bone marrow generally shows normal granulocyte maturation up to either the metamyelocyte or band form stage with a paucity of PMNs. This bone marrow picture is referred to as a &quot;maturational arrest&quot;.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-appearing children with transient neutropenia, particularly of short duration, are also at low risk for infection. In one study of 119 children, infectious complications occurred in 4 of the 36 patients who had neutropenia for more than 30 days (two with stomatitis, one with cellulitis, and one with pneumonia) but in none with a shorter duration of neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to differences in bone marrow reserve, several other factors may contribute to the variability in infectious risk. Many patients with chronic forms of neutropenia have normal or increased blood monocyte counts. Monocytes are functioning phagocytes such as the neutrophil and band forms and probably contribute to the lack of correlation between the ANC and infection risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Neutropenia related to underlying immunodeficiency may have normal marrow reserve yet increased risk because of inability to make protective antibodies or mucosal barrier damage secondary to vasculitis.</p><p>Another difference is that the delivery of neutrophils to tissues in chronic severe neutropenia appears to be greater than in acute chemotherapy-induced neutropenia of equal degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,39</a>]. Furthermore, recovery of neutrophils is evident at tissue sites before the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These observations indicate that the ANC does not always accurately reflect neutrophil availability at tissue or organ sites of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific pathogens associated with neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific pathogens isolated from infected neutropenic patients are almost exclusively pyogenic or enteric bacteria or certain fungi (eg, Candida species). They are usually endogenous bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus from the skin and Gram-negative organisms from the gastrointestinal and urinary tract. Isolated neutropenia does not increase the susceptibility to viral or parasitic infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of candidemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Immunocompromised patients'</a>.)</p><p>Common sites of infection include the oral cavity and mucous membranes, the skin, and perirectal and genital areas. With persistent severe neutropenia, systemic infection occurs associated with bacteremia, and infections of the lung and gastrointestinal tract. Patients receiving broad spectrum antibiotics for two weeks or more while neutropenic are more prone to infection with enteric bacteria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fungi, while patients with indwelling catheters or other foreign bodies are more likely to become infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci.</p><p>One study evaluated the distribution of organisms for 909 episodes of bacteremia and associated outcome among 799 neutropenic febrile cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Among the bacteremic episodes, 46 percent were due to Gram-positive organisms, 42 percent to Gram-negative organisms, and 12 percent were polymicrobial. Infection at a site other than blood alone was observed in 242 episodes; the sites of involvement included lung (about 40 percent), skin and soft tissue (about 30 percent), urinary tract, sinuses and oropharynx, skeletal, enteric tract, meninges, and endocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In general, the initial and ultimate response rates were good when the infection was due to a single type of organism and less favorable when the infection was due to more than one type of microbe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the approach to the patient with neutropenia is confirmation of the diagnosis. Review of a Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear will confirm the reduced number of neutrophils. In all cases in which the white blood cell differential count has been generated by automatic counters, it should be repeated manually. Pseudoneutropenia can occur if blood is left standing for a prolonged period of time and in the presence of paraproteinemia and certain anticoagulants that can cause cellular clumping.</p><p>Because most acquired cases of neutropenia are transient, monitoring of the blood counts for 8 to 12 weeks is often the best approach if there are no other important clinical factors present. An approach for following such patients is shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66041\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66041 \">algorithm 1</a>). This algorithm works for patients of all ages, including adults. For isolated mild or severe neutropenia in the absence any abnormal clinical findings, obtaining serial blood counts at increasing intervals is the most reasonable approach. We recommend monitoring the sedimentation rate as well. Elevation of the sedimentation rate in the absence of other findings in a neutropenic patient can indicate deep-seated inflammation and may indicate a more serious type of neutropenia. According to this schema, if the patient develops clinical symptoms related to neutropenia or changes in other cell lines in the blood count, a full evaluation should be undertaken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants and young children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of neutropenia in infants and young children includes isoimmune neonatal neutropenia, autoimmune neutropenia, severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), Shwachman Diamond-Oski syndrome, and cyclic neutropenia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient mild to moderate neutropenia can be caused by a variety of common viral infections during childhood, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parvovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human herpes virus 6 (HHV6).

Thus, we prefer to do tests for collagen vascular disease and nutritional disorders first, prior to marrow examination.</p><p>Patients who have episodic infections should have twice weekly measurement of the ANC for at least six weeks to confirm the diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia. Patients with cyclic neutropenia have decreased marrow cellularity one week before the nadir of their neutropenia.

Chronic gingivitis and recurrent stomatitis can be major sources of morbidity. Antibiotic mouthwashes, such as Peridex, can be used to decrease gingivitis. Prophylactic antibiotics are of no value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with bone marrow hypoplasia and/or severe infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This group includes patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or bone marrow granulocyte hypoplasia. There are multiple causes of the latter problem, such as aplastic anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, Shwachman Diamond-Oski syndrome, pure white cell aplasia, large granulocyte lymphocyte syndrome, and drug-induced (toxic-form) agranulocytosis. The general approach involves preventive measures to limit the number and severity of infections and aggressive treatment of infections that occur. Patients should also receive aggressive antibacterial therapy for fever, even in the absence of signs of infection.</p><p>G-CSF should be given to patients with decreased marrow reserve and an inadequate response to antibiotics. Treatment with G-CSF is indicated in most cases of severe congenital neutropenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organisms that cause infections in patients with severe neutropenia usually come from the gastrointestinal tract or skin and can result in the rapid onset of overwhelming sepsis. Thus, febrile patients with neutropenia related to marrow suppression should be treated immediately, following culture of body fluids, with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics for coverage of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>In general, patients with an ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1000/microL</span> can be managed on an outpatient basis while those with an ANC of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL</span> and marrow aplasia may require inpatient treatment with parenteral antibiotics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903 \">table 1</a>). Routine reverse isolation procedures are of no benefit and serve to decrease contact with medical personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>When a patient first presents with high fever and has a very low ANC, one must assume that the patient is high risk and has inadequate marrow reserve. The schema in the algorithm is an accepted approach to such patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81789\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81789 \">algorithm 2</a>). Specific antibiotic regimens for such patients can be found elsewhere in UpToDate.

Unlike the &quot;low risk&quot; group as defined for oncology patients, these patients may not require any antibiotics at all. &quot;Low risk&quot; febrile oncology patients by definition have decreased marrow reserve and therefore are excluded from our low risk group. Otherwise, the oncology risk classification and treatment approaches are useful for non-oncological neutropenia cases as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-assessment-of-adults-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk assessment of adults with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Monitoring of the C-reactive protein level and sedimentation rate daily or every other day can be very helpful in these patients, particularly in patients with established severe chronic neutropenia. Often, cultures are negative and treatment is purely empiric. A rapid response can indicate that the appropriate antibiotics have been selected, and poor response or increase in ESR after a response can indicate that a change in antibiotics is necessary.</p><p>Antibiotics should be continued for several days after the fever has subsided and the sedimentation rate has normalized. If the ANC has risen above <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL</span> on several measures, the antibiotics may be discontinued as long as no source of infection is apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

However, better methods of procurement and their rapid efficacy makes them a useful part of the armamentarium for treating neutropenic patients with sepsis.

On treatment, 108 patients had a median ANC greater than or equal to <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/microL</span> and bone marrow aspirates showed increased proportions of maturing neutrophils.
