Most adverse food reactions in adults are due to various forms of food intolerance, which are nonimmunologic reactions. This topic provides an overview of the most common forms of food allergies seen in adults and briefly outlines the many different forms of food intolerance. Childhood food allergy is presented elsewhere in detail, as are specific food allergy syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374023795\"><span class=\"h1\">NONALLERGIC ADVERSE FOOD REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonallergic adverse food reactions can arise from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastrointestinal infections, deficiency of digestive enzymes, disorders resulting from anatomic and neurologic abnormalities, metabolic diseases, toxin-mediated reactions, and a host of other processes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51225 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-intolerance-and-food-allergy-in-adults-an-overview/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H769132505\"><span class=\"h2\">Food intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food intolerance refers to difficulty digesting or metabolizing a particular food. Food intolerance disorders are a subset of all adverse food reactions and are reported by 15 to 20 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-intolerance-and-food-allergy-in-adults-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Food intolerances are even more common among patients with irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders, with 50 to 80 percent reporting consistent problems with certain foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-intolerance-and-food-allergy-in-adults-an-overview/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome#H19618519\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Food sensitivity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H223185803\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparison with food allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food intolerances are not immunologic allergies and do not carry the same risk, although patients may not appreciate this distinction. A simple way to explain the difference is that food intolerance generally involves the digestive system, the amount of food ingested is directly related to the severity of symptoms, and the food causes similar symptoms with each exposure. In contrast, food allergies involve the immune system, and with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies, even tiny amounts of the food can cause severe reactions. Finally, IgE-mediated, food-allergic reactions are unpredictable and have the potential to progress to a serious or life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1109387989\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features of food intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical features of food intolerances traverse a spectrum of organ systems and vary among different disorders, although most involve prominent gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive intestinal gas, bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are common symptoms.</p><p>With food intolerances, the amount of the food ingested tends to be more directly related to the severity of symptoms, compared with immunologic food allergies, in which even trace amounts of the food can trigger an explosive reaction. As an example, a patient who can eat one or two strawberries without symptoms but develops erythema and irritation around the mouth with an entire bowl of strawberries likely has an intolerance to strawberries, rather than an IgE-mediated allergy. A possible explanation for such symptoms is that some berries (eg, strawberries and blueberries) contain natural histamine-like or histamine-releasing compounds and can cause minor skin eruptions, itching, or urticaria in some children and adults. Other foods that naturally contain relatively high amounts of &quot;biogenic amines&quot; include chocolate, tomato, and banana [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-intolerance-and-food-allergy-in-adults-an-overview/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1383831177\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examples of well-described food intolerances include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactase deficiency (also known as lactose intolerance) &ndash; Lactose intolerance presents as bloating, flatulence, abdominal cramping, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea after consumption of lactose in dairy products.

The terms &quot;allergy&quot; and &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; are often used interchangeably in the literature, although the term &quot;allergy&quot; is preferred in this topic review.</p><p>There are multiple types of food allergy, each with distinct clinical and pathophysiologic features. Food allergies are broadly categorized into either immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated or non-IgE-mediated processes (eg, food protein-induced enterocolitis, cell-mediated contact dermatitis to foods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-intolerance-and-food-allergy-in-adults-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some disorders, such as eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, have characteristics of both mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F113569\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113569 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289778817\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMEDIATE (IgE-MEDIATED) FOOD ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions are referred to as &quot;immediate&quot; because signs and symptoms typically develop rapidly after ingestion of the culprit food (ie, within seconds to minutes).

Food allergies can develop at any age, although most present in childhood. In a retrospective chart review, approximately 15 percent of patients with an initial food allergy diagnosis developed the problem as an adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-intolerance-and-food-allergy-in-adults-an-overview/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The same study found that age at first reaction peaked during the early 30s, although there was a wide range, with initial onset as late as 86 years of age.

Thus, the role of acid suppression remains unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2017732860\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combinations of the following signs and symptoms are typical: Pruritus; urticaria; flushing; swelling of the lips, face, or throat; nausea; vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; wheezing; lightheadedness; syncope; or hypotension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 4</a>). Acute urticaria is probably the most common cutaneous manifestation of IgE-mediated food reactions, generally appearing within minutes of ingestion of the causative food. By comparison, food allergies are rarely an underlying cause of chronic urticaria (defined as greater than six weeks of regular outbreaks). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The severity of IgE-mediated reactions are variable and unpredictable, such that the individual may develop hives on one occasion but life-threatening anaphylaxis with the next ingestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 5</a>).

In this condition, urticaria develops only on skin that was in direct contact with the food. In addition to the common allergens, raw meats, seafood, raw vegetables and fruits, mustard, rice, and beer are among the foods that have been implicated in this form of reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-intolerance-and-food-allergy-in-adults-an-overview/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Other than urticaria, isolated dermatitis is an uncommon presentation of IgE-mediated food allergy in adults. In contrast, among children with severe eczema (atopic dermatitis), food allergy was found to exacerbate eczema and cause other symptoms in up to one-third of subjects in some studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2655247307\"><span class=\"h2\">Causative foods and allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although any food can cause IgE-mediated allergy, a few foods cause most of these reactions. <span class=\"nowrap\">Fish/seafood</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">peanuts/tree</span> nuts are the two food groups that cause the majority of adult food allergies, both of which are estimated to affect up to 2 percent of the United States population. The other foods that cause allergy in adults vary around the world, probably reflecting the prominence of that food in the diet.</p><p>Most food allergens are proteins. Occasionally, carbohydrate allergens have been implicated in allergic reactions to certain meats (eg, beef, pork, and lamb). (See <a href=\"#H235371660\" class=\"local\">'Delayed allergy to red meat'</a> below.)</p><p>Pesticides, additives, artificial colors, and antibiotics in animal feeds are often suspected by the patient to be the cause of an allergic food reaction, but in reality, these substances are rare causes of allergy. Patients may also ask whether organic foods are less allergenic that nonorganic foods. There is no difference in allergenicity because both contain the same proteins, and most food allergens are proteins. The small number of additives that have been implicated in IgE-mediated reactions are often derived from natural substances, such as carrageenan (from seaweed), lupine flour, pectin (from fruits and vegetables), gelatin, annatto (a red dye produced from the seeds of the achiote tree), and carmine red (derived from insect bodies). Allergic reactions to food additives are discussed separately.

It is a generally mild form of food allergy that is caused by contact of the mouth and throat with raw fruits and vegetables and sometimes nuts. The most frequent symptoms of OAS are itchiness or mild swelling of the mouth, face, lip, tongue, and throat, generally developing within minutes after eating raw fruits or vegetables. Cooked fruits and vegetables typically do not elicit the symptoms, and this is an important question in the clinical history. Tree nuts and peanuts (raw and cooked) can also cause isolated oral symptoms, although these foods can also cause more serious systemic reactions. It is appropriate to refer all nut reactions to an allergy specialist. (See <a href=\"#H2977626743\" class=\"local\">'Referral'</a> below.)</p><p>OAS is IgE-mediated and considered a form of contact allergy that develops in patients sensitized to pollens. Most patients also report seasonal allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis. Common examples include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60787 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birch-allergic patients may develop itching of the lips or mouth upon eating fresh apple, pear, cherry, carrot, celery, or handling raw potato</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ragweed-allergic patients may react to melons and banana</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mugwort-allergic patients may react to raw celery</p><p/><p>OAS is caused by the presence of heat-labile proteins (eg, profilins) within these foods that are cross-reactive with allergenic pollen proteins. Patients may suspect that these reactions are caused by pesticides, fungicides, waxes, or other chemicals on the fruits or vegetables, but this is not the case. The allergenic proteins cause mild symptoms in the mucosal surfaces of the mouth and throat and are then destroyed by the acid pH in the stomach (or by heat during cooking), so the reaction typically does not present with gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms. However, a small minority of patients (ie, &lt;2 percent) report systemic symptoms, and these patients should be evaluated by an allergist for more serious forms of food allergy and supplied with an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector.

This form of meat allergy is distinguished by a delayed onset, with symptoms appearing three to six hours after ingestion (sometimes in the middle of the night, if meat was eaten for dinner). The symptoms are otherwise typical of IgE-mediated reactions, such as urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis, sometimes with gastrointestinal symptoms or hypotension. Allergy due to sensitization to alpha-gal is described in an increasing number of countries, including the United States, Australia, Spain, Germany, Japan, and Sweden.

This is generally done before any testing takes place to determine the pretest probability that will inform interpretation of the results. Testing for IgE-mediated food allergies can be performed with skin testing or in vitro immunoassays for IgE specific to the food in question. Skin testing is the preferred method of diagnosing food allergy in most cases, because it is usually more sensitive and the negative predictive value is high. Skin testing should be performed by allergy specialists. If skin testing or in vitro testing is inconclusive, a graded challenge may be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Prick/puncture skin tests'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Food challenges'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with IgE-mediated allergy, allergists can also provide advice about effective avoidance and ongoing education about anaphylaxis and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors, which requires time and can be challenging to do in a busy primary care setting.

The definitive diagnosis of an IgE-mediated food allergy requires <strong>both</strong> sensitization and a history of consistent signs and symptoms on exposure to that food. Sensitization alone is not sufficient to diagnose food allergy, because individuals can be sensitized to a food (which is not uncommon) without having clinical symptoms upon ingestion. For example, patients with respiratory allergy to dust mite may have positive serum IgE to shrimp or other shellfish (because the testing cannot differentiate between different allergens within these two phylogenetically-related organisms) but not have shrimp allergy. For this reason, searching for culprit foods with extensive panels of IgE immunoassays when the history is vague is rarely productive and can be misleading.</p><p>In contrast, an immunoassay for IgE to the specific food in question can be very helpful if one or a small number of suspect foods are implicated by the history. For example, it is reasonable for the generalist to obtain an immunoassay for IgE to shrimp if a patient developed hives, pruritus, and nausea while eating shrimp cocktail. When the clinical history is highly suggestive of allergy to a specific food (high pretest probability), a positive in vitro test is often sufficient for diagnosis.</p><p>Immunoassays for food-specific IgE are widely available and not affected by antihistamines or other medications the patient may be taking. Higher concentrations of food-specific IgE correlate to an increased likelihood of a reaction upon ingestion, although a patient with a significant food allergy can have a high, medium, low, or even negative in vitro test. A patient can also have a low-positive level to a food that is tolerated. The use and interpretation of IgE immunoassays and skin tests to foods is reviewed in detail separately.
