Red blood cells are the cells in your blood that carry oxygen. If you have too few red blood cells, your body does not get all the oxygen it needs.</p><p>Different things can cause anemia. &quot;Anemia of chronic disease&quot; can happen in people who have a long-term disease or condition such as arthritis or cancer. Their condition causes the body to produce fewer red blood cells. Anemia of chronic disease is also called &quot;anemia of chronic inflammation.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190068053\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of anemia of chronic disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with anemia of chronic disease have no symptoms. They find out they have it after their doctor does blood tests for another reason.</p><p>People who do have symptoms might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel tired or weak, especially if they try to exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get out of breath easily or feel their heart racing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have headaches</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190068060\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have a long-term disease or condition and get the symptoms listed above, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190068067\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for anemia of chronic disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is not one specific test for anemia of chronic disease. Your doctor might do a variety of blood tests to look for other causes of anemia including a thyroid problem, low levels of iron or certain vitamins, or other blood problems. In some cases, you might need a test that lets the doctor look at cells from your bone marrow under a microscope.</p><p>If you have anemia and all of your other tests look normal, and you have a chronic condition that could cause the body to produce fewer red blood cells, your doctor might decide that anemia of chronic disease is the likely cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190068074\"><span class=\"h1\">How is anemia of chronic disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what's causing the anemia and if your anemia is causing symptoms.</p><p>The most important thing is treating the long-term condition that's causing your anemia. For example, if you have diabetes, you might need to get your blood sugar under better control. Or if you have certain forms of chronic arthritis, you might get medicines to treat that.</p><p>Other treatment depends on your symptoms. If your anemia of chronic disease is causing no symptoms, it does not need to be treated.</p><p>If your anemia of chronic disease is causing symptoms, your doctor might treat it with medicines to help your body make more red blood cells, although this is not commonly done. If your body is low in iron, your doctor might give you iron supplements.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
