The clinical staging of puberty is performed by the criteria established by James Tanner. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the upper 95th percentile in the United States for age for boys is 14 (ie, an increase in testicular size being the first sign) and for girls is 12 (breast development being the first sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55329 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Delayed puberty usually results from inadequate gonadal steroid secretion which, in turn, is most often caused by a defective gonadotropin secretion from the anterior pituitary, due to defective production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, the key functional defect in patients with constitutional delay of puberty. It can, however, also be caused by a variety of hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal disorders.

This defect can be because of hypothalamic dysfunction (either anatomic or functional), hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, or hyperprolactinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Impaired secretion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> action of hypothalamic GnRH typically is the underlying cause of secondary hypogonadism. It can be functional in origin (as in constitutional delay of puberty, chronic illness, excessive exercise, malnutrition, and stress) or related to associated pathology (as with hypothalamic and pituitary tumors, especially craniopharyngioma), or genetic causes (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia [Kallmann's syndrome], or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [IHH]).

In addition, because 10 to 15 percent of cases of well-documented isolated GnRH deficiency undergo spontaneous reversals after being treated with sex steroids, these distinctions between constitutional delay of puberty and isolated GnRH deficiency are becoming less absolute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, a complete history and physical examination should precede any biochemical testing or imaging studies are performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history helps determine whether pubertal development is totally absent or had started but then &quot;stalled.&quot; Thus, assessment of the patient's growth pattern up to the time of evaluation is critical. Patients with constitutional delay have delayed (not stalled) growth, adrenarche, and sexual development in temporal association with declining height velocity, delayed skeletal maturation, and delayed adrenal androgen maturation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other important issues in the history include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional habits, exercise intensity, prior medical illness, or medication usage that may delay the onset or slow the tempo of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Delays in sexual maturation and height velocity often can be the first clinical signs of underlying disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hypothyroidism, or psychosocial deprivation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of associated congenital abnormalities (eg, midline defects, cryptorchidism, skeletal abnormalities like cleft <span class=\"nowrap\">lip/palate,</span> or scoliosis) suggests congenital GnRH deficiency (particularly resulting from mutations in the fibroblast growth factor [FGF] signaling pathway), with or without other hypothalamic defects. Neurologic symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, anosmia, dyskinesia, seizures, and intellectual disability (mental retardation) strongly suggest a central nervous system (CNS) disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive family history of either constitutional delay of puberty or congenital GnRH deficiency can be a useful clue. Indeed, delayed puberty has a significant genetic basis often demonstrating an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, with or without incomplete penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Furthermore, higher rates of constitutional delay of puberty have been observed in families with congenital GnRH deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, this finding is nonspecific and is common in both constitutional delay and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. As examples, mutations in FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) and CHD7 demonstrate an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, whereas KAL1 and NR0B1 (DAX1) demonstrate an X-linked pattern within a pedigree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. TAC3 or TAC3R mutations are associated with microphallus and cryptorchidism in males, and spontaneous reversal during adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Early signs of sexual development unnoticed by the patient (such as testicular growth) may permit reassurance and avoidance of an otherwise costly evaluation in the otherwise normal child. Often serial height and testicular measurements made over one or two years will help clarify the diagnosis.</p><p>Both the standing height and the arm span should be measured. An arm span exceeding the height by more than 5 cm (ie, eunuchoidal body habitus) suggests delayed epiphyseal closure secondary to hypogonadism. The height should be plotted on growth charts that include normal growth patterns with centiles or standard deviation scores (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74388\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74388 \">figure 1</a>) to place the current height in the proper developmental context and to allow comparison with both current and subsequent bone age determination. The height velocity should be carefully documented for at least six months. </p><p>Secondary sexual characteristics should be staged according to the Tanner criteria, also called sexual maturity ratings (SMR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55329 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In girls, this may include determining the presence of a uterus typically by an abdominal ultrasound if the patient is virginal or by transvaginal techniques that are far preferable to pelvic examination in this population; the uterus is absent in patients with androgen insensitivity and disorders of the M&uuml;llerian duct system. </p><p>In boys, testicular size should be measured by a Prader orchidometer. The earliest signs of pubertal development are a testicular volume of greater than or equal to 4 mL in boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60225\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60225 \">figure 2</a>) (corresponding to about 2.0 to 3.1 cm in testicular length), and the appearance of breast buds in girls. If either is present, normal spontaneous puberty can be anticipated in more than 95 percent of patients and the family can be reassured for the most part. However, longitudinal follow-up is essential since some children with genetic causes of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can exhibit stuttering onset or cessation after some initial signs of pubertal development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;, section on 'Sexual maturity rating (Tanner stages)'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Particular attention also should be paid to the symmetry of the testes as gonadal tumors can occur in several intersex disorders presenting at puberty with asymmetrical gonadal development and defects in sexual maturation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An x-ray of the left hand and wrist to evaluate bone age may be obtained at the initial visit to assess skeletal maturation and repeated over time if needed. The baseline x-ray provides valuable information about the relationship between chronologic age and skeletal maturation, the potential for future skeletal growth, and allows a preliminary prediction of adult height. Patients with constitutional delay of puberty typically have bone ages of 12 to 13.5 years but rarely progress beyond this age without the presence of pubertal levels of gonadal steroids because sex steroids are required for epiphyseal closure.</p><p>Depending upon the clinical findings and the results of the initial biochemical work-up, other imaging studies may be indicated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic or testicular ultrasonography should be performed when an ovarian or testicular mass is detected on the physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic ultrasound also may be performed in girls with delayed puberty to determine the presence or absence of a uterus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head MRI should be ordered if associated neurologic symptoms or signs suggest a central process, or if the laboratory studies are consistent with hypothalamic or pituitary disease. In addition, clinicians may request particular imaging to assess the presence or <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoplasia/absence</span> of the olfactory bulb, nerves, and tract which can provide insight into the possibility of Kallmann syndrome. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21033740\"><span class=\"h3\">General evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further evaluation should be directed at the possibility of nutritional disorders, occult chronic illness (eg, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, anorexia nervosa, or hepatic disease) that may affect the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and hormonal abnormalities. Initial screening should include a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver function tests. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21033733\"><span class=\"h3\">Hormonal tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hormonal evaluation should include the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Random measurements of serum LH and FSH, together with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> (females) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> (males), should be obtained to distinguish between primary and secondary hypogonadism. These measurements do not need to be corrected or scaled for age, but they do depend critically on adequate normative data from the reference laboratory. By adolescence, patients with primary hypogonadism have serum gonadotropin concentrations that are elevated and usually easily distinguished from their normal peers; this is particularly true for FSH levels which provide the greatest discriminate value at this time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On the other hand, baseline serum gonadotropin values are typically low in both constitutional delay of puberty and congenital GnRH deficiency. Ultrasensitive immunofluorometric assays for LH and FSH may eventually prove capable of distinguishing between the low gonadotropin levels of patients with constitutional delay versus the undetectable levels in GnRH-deficient patients; however, these assays have not yet been widely validated for the screening of truly GnRH-deficient patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GnRH stimulation testing is not recommended because it does not help distinguish between these disorders as there is significant overlap of LH and FSH responses between the two groups of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Several reports have suggested stimulation tests with other GnRH agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buserelin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buserelin</a> are better at differentiating GnRH-deficient patients from those with constitutional delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In most patients, however, the distinction between congenital GnRH deficiency and constitutional delay of puberty remains ambiguous and can be resolved only with time and serial observations. In some patients, therapy may be initiated prior to determining the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A random measurement of serum prolactin should be obtained to detect hyperprolactinemia, which can present clinically as &quot;stalled&quot; puberty. An elevated prolactin level can result from a lactotroph adenoma (prolactinoma) or from any hypothalamic or pituitary disorder that interrupts hypothalamic inhibition of prolactin secretion. Hyperprolactinemia (unless clearly related to a prolactin-raising medication) should be followed by CNS imaging of the hypothalamus and the pituitary region by head MRI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests for hypothyroidism, which delays puberty by as yet unknown mechanisms, should be obtained, particularly if height velocity has suddenly slowed and the bone age is markedly delayed. An elevated serum concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is the hallmark of primary hypothyroidism; however, the values are usually normal or low when hypothyroidism is a result of hypothalamic or pituitary disease. As a result, serum free T4 should be measured if CNS disease is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22059968\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending upon the clinical findings and the results of the hormonal testing, the evaluation can then be completed with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of adrenal androgens, especially serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), a sex steroid almost exclusively of adrenal origin, may help to distinguish between congenital GnRH deficiency and constitutional delay of puberty. Patients with GnRH deficiency are more likely to have normal adrenal maturation (ie, adrenarche) and normal serum concentrations of adrenal androgens than patients with delayed puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], but the values in the two groups often overlap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A karyotype or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array should be performed in every patient with primary hypogonadism to evaluate the possibility of Klinefelter syndrome in boys and Turner syndrome in girls.

As examples, thyroid hormone replacement in hypothyroidism or dopamine agonist treatment of lactotroph adenomas, and excision of craniopharyngiomas can result in prompt institution of sexual maturation in the appropriate clinical circumstances. In most patients, however, the distinction between congenital GnRH deficiency and constitutional delay of puberty remains uncertain, and can be resolved only with serial observations. &#160;</p><p>In view of these diagnostic difficulties, the initial therapeutic approach is similar for both disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Spontaneous pubertal development is then often evident and organic disease is excluded by testicular enlargement (which, if present, implies gonadotropin stimulation) and increasing testosterone concentrations after the cessation of therapy.</p><p>Although some reports indicate that delayed onset of puberty may compromise adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], most studies indicate that height is not adversely affected, particularly if the duration of sex steroid therapy is brief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/24-27,30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27,30,33</a>]. The use of low doses of androgens for limited periods of time maximizes the likelihood that the boy will reach his &quot;predicted&quot; final height unless the diagnosis of GnRH deficiency is clearly established.</p><p>In one report, for example, 15 boys with constitutional delay of puberty were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> enanthate (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/month)</span> for a mean of 1.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Mean height velocity increased from the 3rd percentile for mean bone age to above the 90th percentile and mean testicular volume rose from 5.9 to 11.3 mL during therapy, this latter observation suggesting the course of androgen therapy was accompanied by the occurrence of spontaneous puberty. Skeletal maturation increased only in the boys with an initial bone age below the group mean. After cessation of therapy, bone age and sexual development proceeded normally and the boys ultimately achieved their predicted mean height. Similar results have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/24-27,30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27,30,33</a>]. Thus, it is unusual for a boy with constitutional delay of puberty to require more than two courses of androgen therapy before spontaneous puberty occurs.</p><p>Boys with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, in contrast, typically demonstrate little or no pubertal development with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> and any pubertal progress they have made stops with cessation of therapy. After the age of 18 in these patients without any organic or obvious pathologic causes, congenital GnRH deficiency is the most likely diagnosis. However, approximately ten percent of the GnRH-deficient patients appear to undergo a spontaneous reversal later in life after sex steroid exposure. This reversal is heralded by testicular enlargement, or the ability to sustain a normal testosterone concentration off of treatment or following a missed prescription refill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In girls, estrogen may be given orally or transdermally, initially at doses below those used for replacement therapy in adults. Some experts start with conjugated estrogens 0.3 mg daily, approximately one-half of the dose used in adults. But the trend has been to start with even lower doses, such as oral micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> or transdermal estradiol 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> (the lowest available transdermal dose). In women with Turner syndrome, some experts suggest either cutting the transdermal patch, or wearing the patch only at night to administer even lower doses of transdermal estrogen (6.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/day)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62742\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62742 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-turner-syndrome#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Management of ovarian failure'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>These doses are below that required to induce menstruation. We increase the estrogen dose gradually over two years as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62742\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62742 \">table 3</a>). A progestin should not be added until there is substantial breast development that is not solely confined to the areolae, and full contour breast growth has plateaued as premature initiation of progestin therapy can compromise ultimate breast growth. </p><p>We add cyclic progestin therapy after two years of estrogen or when breakthrough bleeding occurs on unopposed estrogen. Our first choice for progestin therapy is oral micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> 200 mg days 1 to 12 of the calendar month. </p><p>Once breast growth has plateaued during serial evaluation and menstruation been established, estrogen therapy can be discontinued intermittently for one- to three-month periods to determine if spontaneous menstruation occurs, which should happen in girls with constitutional delay. As in boys, persistent hypogonadism beyond age 18 is highly suggestive of congenital GnRH deficiency. At this time, full adult replacement therapy with both estrogen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> should be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth hormone therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The value of growth hormone therapy in patients without documented growth hormone deficiency is controversial. Serum growth hormone and IGF-I concentrations are usually low in patients with constitutional delay of puberty and increase in response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> or estrogen therapy. Patients with congenital GnRH deficiency are typically not growth hormone-deficient and do not benefit from growth hormone therapy since sex steroids evoke these normal increases in their growth axis. Although the administration of growth hormone is less likely to induce epiphyseal closure than sex steroids and may therefore add to adult height, children with delayed puberty grow well when treated with sex steroids alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

In the United States, the upper 95th percentile in the United States for boys to initiate puberty is 14 (an increase in testicular size being the first sign) and for girls is 12 (breast development being the first sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55329 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary hypogonadism is characterized by high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Secondary hypogonadism is characterized by low to normal concentrations of LH and FSH, and typically is caused by impaired secretion of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62372\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62372 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17171365\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary hypogonadism'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No single test reliably distinguishes patients with constitutional delay of puberty (who will eventually progress spontaneously through puberty) from patients with other causes of delayed puberty, particularly congenital GnRH deficiency. The most valuable components of an assessment are a focused history and physical examination, and observation over time. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history helps determine whether pubertal development is totally absent or had started but then &quot;stalled.&quot; Patients with constitutional delay of puberty have delayed (not stalled) growth, adrenarche, and sexual development. The history should also solicit information about underlying chronic disease, congenital anomalies, family history of pubertal development, and sense of smell. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination includes accurate determination of Tanner stage of pubertal development, including measurements of height, and weight, and of testicular size in boys. Height velocity should be calculated from serial measurements of height over six months or more. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of bone age at the initial evaluation provides valuable information about the relationship between chronologic age and skeletal maturation. Children with constitutional delay of puberty typically have bone ages of 12 to 13.5 years but rarely progress beyond this age without evidence of pubertal maturation. Other imaging studies that are useful in selected patients include pelvic or testicular ultrasound and head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation for a patient with delayed puberty should include measurement of serum LH and FSH, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4. Most patients should also be screened for chronic diseases that may cause pubertal delay, using a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and liver function tests. In selected patients, measurement of adrenal androgens or karyotype is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a specific underlying disorder can be identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62372\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62372 \">table 2</a>), therapy should be targeted at that disorder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, the distinction between congenital GnRH deficiency and constitutional delay of puberty remains uncertain, and can be resolved only with serial observations. Short-term hormonal therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> in boys and with estrogen in girls may be appropriate when the pubertal delay is severe or the patient's psychosocial concerns about the delay play a prominent role that cannot be addressed by reassurance and education alone.
