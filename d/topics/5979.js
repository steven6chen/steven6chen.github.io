It was first described in 2014 as a cause of infection in a resident of Bourbon county in eastern Kansas; it has also been observed in Missouri [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>The patient was a male over 50 years of age who developed fever, chills, weakness, anorexia, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, and diarrhea. He had a recent history of several tick bites and had recently removed an engorged tick. Physical examination was notable for fever, a diffuse maculopapular rash on his chest, abdomen, and back, and nontender left axillary adenopathy. Laboratory studies demonstrated leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated aspartate aminotransferase level. The patient was treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for presumed tickborne illness with no clinical response. His pulmonary, hepatic, and renal function deteriorated, and he died 11 days after onset of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Extensive diagnostic testing for known tickborne pathogens was negative. Results of plaque reduction neutralization testing for Heartland virus at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on blood collected on day 9 of illness suggested the presence of an unrecognized virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Electron microscopic study demonstrated viral particles consistent with viruses in the Orthomyxovirus family. Genome sequencing, real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, and phylogenetic analysis revealed a novel virus most closely related to two other viruses in the <em>Thogotovirus</em> genus that have been found only in the Eastern hemisphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of Bourbon virus disease includes Lyme disease, Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Heartland virus infection, leptospirosis, and influenza.</p><p>Studies to identify the host and vector are underway.

Variegated squirrels are tree squirrels found in Central America that are sometimes kept as exotic pets.</p><p>Fatal encephalitis was observed among three breeders of variegated squirrels in Germany between 2011 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The patients were males 62 to 72 years old and were mutual friends who had shared their variegated squirrel breeding pairs on multiple occasions; all had underlying comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The illnesses were characterized by fever, chills, confusion, unsteady gait, and psychomotor slowing with progression to coma. All three patients developed bilateral crural vein thrombosis and aspiration pneumonia; two developed pulmonary emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated hyperintense lesions in temporal, parietal, and cortical areas in two patients and dilated ventricles with meningeal contrast enhancement in the third patient. Abnormal electroencephalogram findings were observed in all three patients.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of variegated squirrel bornavirus encephalitis includes herpes simplex encephalitis, herpes B encephalitis, rabies, tickborne encephalitis, <em>Toxoplasma</em> encephalitis, neurosyphilis, and brain abscess.</p><p>Laboratory investigation using a metagenomic approach revealed VSBV-1 RNA in brain specimens from all three patients and from a healthy squirrel owned by one of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Oropouche virus disease was first described in 1961 in Vega de Oropouche, Trinidad [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The first epidemic occurred in Belem, Brazil, in 1961 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Subsequently, the virus has been associated with large epidemics and sporadic disease in tropical areas of Brazil, Peru, and Panama [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/19,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21-24</a>].</p><p>Oropouche virus disease is transmitted by biting midges (<em>Culicoides paraensis</em>); in rural areas, the transmission cycle may involve midges as well as nonhuman primates, sloths, birds, and mosquitoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/19,21,22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22,25</a>]. In urban areas, Oropouche virus transmission can occur between viremic individuals and biting midges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p><em>C. paraensis</em> has been observed to breed in piles of rotting banana stumps and cacao husks; farmers with exposure to bananas and cacao appear to be at increased risk for transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The risk of Oropouche virus transmission appears to be greatest during the rainy season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p><em>C. paraensis</em> has been identified in a number of states east of the Mississippi River [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Human-to-human transmission by <em>C. paraensis</em> could potentially occur. However, the potential for the establishment of a rural transmission cycle in the United States if the virus were introduced seems extremely low given the absence of the ecologic conditions observed in epidemic settings.</p><p>The incubation period for Oropouche virus disease is typically 4 to 8 days (range 3 to 12 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The illness is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, photophobia, and rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>]. Laboratory findings include leukopenia and neutropenia. Symptoms usually last 4 to 5 days, but recurrence up to 10 days following initial recovery has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Further data are needed on the frequency of asymptomatic infection. Immunity following infection is likely lifelong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Hemorrhagic manifestations (petechiae, epistaxis, and gingival bleeding) were reported in 16 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Meningoencephalitis has been described in a small number of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of Oropouche virus disease is established via detection of antibody (using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or plaque reduction neutralization testing on acute and convalescent sera) or via detection of viral RNA in blood via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Viremia is usually present during the first two days of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-viruses/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of Oropouche virus disease includes dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika virus infections, malaria, leptospirosis, ehrlichiosis, and influenza.</p><p>Treatment of Oropouche virus disease is supportive; no drugs or vaccines are available.
