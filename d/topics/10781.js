These include inhalers, liquids, and pills. You might take one or more depending on how often you have symptoms and how serious they are. The medicine and amount you take might change over time.</p><p>There are 2 main types of asthma medicines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quick-relief medicines</strong> can reduce symptoms in 5 to 15 minutes. People use these medicines to treat asthma attacks or asthma flare-ups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-term controller medicines</strong> help keep asthma symptoms from happening. People take these 1 or 2 times a day every day, even if they have no symptoms. When these medicines are working well, you should need quick-relief medicines less than 2 times a week.</p><p/><p>The medicines listed below are the most common types of asthma medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24479286\"><span class=\"h1\">Short-acting beta agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-acting beta agonists (called &quot;SABAs&quot; or &quot;short-acting bronchodilators&quot;) are quick-relief medicines. They relax the muscles around the airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65956 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>SABAs can help stop an asthma attack. Also, if you have asthma symptoms when you exercise, it can help to use a SABA 15 minutes before exercise. Some people feel shaky after taking a SABA. If this happens, your doctor or nurse might tell you to use just one puff next time. Or he or she might give you a different medicine.</p><p>Some examples of SABAs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">albuterol</a> (sample brand names: ProAir HFA, ProAir RespiClick, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">levalbuterol</a> (brand name: Xopenex HFA). &quot;HFA&quot; means the medicine comes in a metered dose inhaler (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61575 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24479301\"><span class=\"h1\">Inhaled steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled steroids are long-term controller medicines that reduce inflammation in the airways. They help prevent symptoms and asthma attacks in the future. They also help keep asthma from damaging the lungs.</p><p>Inhaled steroids come in different kinds of inhalers. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the inhaler. Each inhaler has its own directions.</p><p>The steroids used to treat asthma are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. It is rare for these medicines to cause side effects. The doctor will give the lowest dose that works well. This reduces the chances of any side effects.</p><p>Some examples of inhaled steroids are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">budesonide</a> (brand name: Pulmicort Flexhaler), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclesonide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ciclesonide</a> (brand name: Alvesco), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fluticasone</a> (brand names: Flovent, Arnuity, Armonair), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">mometasone</a> (brand name: Asmanex Twisthaler).</p><p>Some people do not use their steroid inhaler or don't give their child his or her steroid medicine. This is because they worry about the side effects of steroids or do not &quot;feel&quot; the medicine working. But the truth is that not using a steroid inhaler is much riskier than any side effects it might cause. Inhaled steroids help keep asthma attacks from starting. These attacks can be dangerous and even cause death. Plus, asthma damages the lungs over time. Inhaled steroids can prevent some of that damage. You might not feel any different when you take this medicine, but that does not mean it is not working.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24479318\"><span class=\"h1\">Long-acting beta agonists (LABAs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-acting beta agonists are long-term controller medicines. They relax the muscles around the airways like short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) do. But the effects last much longer. You should only use a LABA at the same time as an inhaled steroid medicine.</p><p>Medicines that have a LABA and steroid in one inhaler include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fluticasone</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">salmeterol</a> (brand names: Advair Diskus, Advair HFA, Seretide), fluticasone with vilanterol (brand name: Breo Ellipta), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">budesonide</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">formoterol</a> (brand name: Symbicort), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">mometasone</a> with formoterol (brand name: Dulera).</p><p>Some LABAs come in a separate inhaler, but you <strong>must</strong> take them at the same time as a steroid medicine. Examples of LABAs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">salmeterol</a> (brand name: Serevent Diskus) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">formoterol</a> (available outside the United States).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24479335\"><span class=\"h1\">Leukotriene modifiers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukotriene modifiers are long-term controller medicines you take in a pill. They reduce inflammation and mucus and relax the muscles around the airways. These medicines don't work for everyone. They are not as strong as inhaled steroid medicines.</p><p>Some examples of leukotriene modifiers are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">montelukast</a> (brand name: Singulair), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zafirlukast-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">zafirlukast</a> (brand name: Accolate), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zileuton-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">zileuton</a> (brand name: Zyflo).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24479352\"><span class=\"h1\">Steroids that come in pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If other asthma medicines do not work well, you might need to take steroid pills for a few days or weeks. Some people with severe asthma take steroid pills for several months or longer. They might need to take pills every day or every other day. Some examples of steroid pills for asthma are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">methylprednisolone</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24479368\"><span class=\"h1\">Omalizumab (brand name: Xolair)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your asthma is caused by allergies and inhaled steroids do not work well, your doctor might give you this medicine. It comes in a shot. The medicine lowers or stops the allergic reaction, and this can help asthma. It is only for people with moderate or very bad asthma.</p><p>If you would like more detailed information, including information on the side effects caused by specific medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for information from Lexicomp, available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24479384\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about asthma medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Take all the medicines your doctor prescribes, exactly how you are supposed to take them. Remember, your controller medicines are helping you even if you do not feel them working. Use your asthma &quot;action plan&quot; if you have one. An action plan is a list of instructions that tells you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which medicines to use every day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which ones to take if your symptoms get worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When to get help or <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong></p><p/><p>If you do not have an asthma action plan, ask your doctor whether you need one.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24479401\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-dry-powder-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your dry powder inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-soft-mist-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your soft mist inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-corticosteroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Inhaled corticosteroid medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
