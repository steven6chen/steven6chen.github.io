Therapy with the chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>) has profoundly changed the management of refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn disease. Over two-thirds of patients with Crohn disease treated with infliximab show response to the drug whereas one-third achieve remission, and maintenance therapy has been approved on account of its glucocorticoid-sparing efficacy in refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-in-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infliximab in Crohn disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy in Crohn disease provided the rationale for clinical trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> (and other anti-TNF agents) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a disorder in which TNF may also have an important role. TNF-a is expressed at high levels in the colonic mucosa of patients with UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is also an increased production of TNF-a by colonic lamina propria mononuclear cells and high concentrations of TNF-a in stools, rectal dialysates, and urine of patients with UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>This topic review will focus on experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> (and other anti-TNF agents) in the management of UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An approach to the management of UC is presented separately.

At least five placebo-controlled trials of infliximab in active UC have been reported as abstracts or in final form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. A meta-analysis examined the role of infliximab in UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Failure to achieve remission was less likely in patients treated with infliximab compared with placebo (43 versus 70 percent; RR 0.72). The meta-analysis estimated that in order to achieve one remission, four patients would need to be treated. In a network meta-analysis of seven randomized trials that compared the efficacy of biologic agents in moderate to severe UC, infliximab was more likely to induce a clinical response and mucosal healing as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> (OR 2.79 and 2.02, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, this evidence needs to be interpreted with caution because it is based on indirect comparisons and there are no head-to-head trials comparing infliximab with adalimumab.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">ACT 1 and ACT 2 trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two largest trials (ACT 1 and ACT 2, each with 364 patients) focused on patients with active ulcerative colitis treated with glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">6-mercaptopurine/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a></span> (ACT 1) or with ulcerative colitis refractory to at least one standard therapy including 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) medications, glucocorticoids, or immunosuppressants (ACT 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> at a dose of 5 or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or placebo at week 0, 2, and 6 and every eight weeks through week 22 (in ACT 2) or week 46 (in ACT 1).

In ACT I, clinical remission was observed at week 54 in approximately 34 percent of the two infliximab groups compared with 17 percent in placebo.

A colectomy was required significantly less often in the infliximab group within three months after randomization (30 versus 66 percent). Three patients in the placebo group required surgery for septic complications. There were no serious adverse events related to infliximab. During three years of follow-up, an additional seven patients underwent colectomy, five in the infliximab group and two in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Overall, 12 of 24 patients (50 percent) in the infliximab group and 16 of 21 patients (76 percent) in the placebo group underwent colectomy.

In a randomized trial, 239 patients with moderate to severe UC were assigned to treatment with infliximab (infusions at 0, 2, 6, and 14 weeks), azathioprine (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily), or combination therapy with both infliximab and azathioprine for 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Glucocorticoid-free clinical remission at 16 weeks was significantly higher in patients treated with combination therapy as compared with azathioprine or infliximab alone (40, 24, and 22 percent, respectively).

It is worth noting that most intravenous cyclosporine trials report 60 to 85 percent response rates in glucocorticoid-resistant UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p>A potential concern in using the drugs in tandem is the risk of adverse events from immunosuppression.

Overall, 30 to 40 percent of patients achieved remission. However, remission was generally of only limited duration and there were several serious adverse events including a death from sepsis. The authors concluded that the risk of serious events may outweigh the benefits of salvage therapy.

Thus, precise estimates of the types of adverse events and their frequency are not available. However, adverse events seen with use of infliximab for Crohn disease and rheumatoid arthritis are also likely to occur with treatment of UC. Many patients eligible for infliximab are on high dose glucocorticoids, making infectious complications a particular concern.

Unlike Crohn disease, UC can ultimately be cured by colectomy. Whether <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> can prevent this outcome, particularly in those with severe and refractory disease, is uncertain. Such patients may be exposed to the risk and expense of infliximab treatment while not preventing (or only delaying) subsequent colectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> is not as pronounced if one considers clinical remission as a reasonable endpoint for treatment of UC and the uncertain durability of the response produced by infliximab. In the ACT 1 trial, for example, clinical remission was achieved significantly more often by eight weeks in the two infliximab groups compared with placebo (39 and 32 versus 15 percent, respectively) and the differences persisted at week 30. Put another way, this means that infliximab was 24 percent better at achieving clinical remission than placebo (or approximately four patients would need to be treated to achieve one response). A similar magnitude of benefit was observed in ACT 2. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials of infliximab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response rates in controlled trials with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> in glucocorticoid-refractory UC patients are inferior to those reported with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> therapy, although the two drugs have not been compared directly, and there have been no controlled trials with cyclosporine that were comparable in size to ACT 1 and ACT 2. There are also safety concerns about giving cyclosporine or infliximab in patients with refractory disease to one or the other of these drugs. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cyclosporine versus infliximab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Until long-term data are available, we suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> be considered in patients with acute steroid-refractory disease who are reluctant to undergo colectomy and in whom <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is contraindicated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-therapy-in-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Masuda H, Iwai S, Tanaka T, Hayakawa S.
