Add-on pharmacotherapy is often necessary because initial treatment with a single antidepressant leads to remission in only 30 to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-antidepressant-combinations/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Options for adjunctive pharmacotherapy include a second antidepressant, as well as second-generation antipsychotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, and triiodothyronine. Adjunctive psychotherapy is also an option. </p><p>Combining two antidepressants for treatment resistant depression is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-antidepressant-combinations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, retrospective studies of patients treated for depression with a single antidepressant (insurance claims database n &gt;134,000; registry database n &gt;240,000) found that a second antidepressant was added in approximately 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-antidepressant-combinations/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. &#160;</p><p>This topic reviews the indications and efficacy of combining antidepressants for patients with unipolar, nonpsychotic major depression.

The combination of a tricyclic plus an MAOI is generally avoided as well due to the same safety concerns, and study results that show no benefit with this combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-antidepressant-combinations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In three trials (n = 387), response was comparable for patients who received either combination treatment or monotherapy, whereas the other two trials (n = 96) found that response was superior with combination therapy. In the largest trial (n = 293), at least one adverse effect occurred in more patients who received the combination than in those who received monotherapy (77 versus 51 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-antidepressant-combinations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In a subsequent, six week randomized trial that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> with duloxetine plus placebo in 46 patients with treatment resistant depression, the frequency of response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) was comparable for patients who received adjunctive bupropion or placebo (26 and 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-antidepressant-combinations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>In addition, a network meta-analysis of 48 randomized trials (n &gt;6000 depressed patients) evaluated the efficacy of augmentation agents, including adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, by using results from direct comparisons between the drugs, as well as indirectly comparing drugs through their relative effect with a common comparator (typically placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-antidepressant-combinations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].
