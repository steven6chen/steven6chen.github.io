Coinfection with HIV has a major impact on the natural history, diagnosis, progression, and morbidity and mortality related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The presence of chronic hepatitis B can also lead to an increased risk of hepatotoxicity related to the administration of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient will be reviewed here. Treatment and prevention as well as issues related to hepatitis C and HIV coinfection are discussed separately.

Chronic HBV affects approximately 10 percent of HIV-infected patients worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and a study of 16,248 HIV-infected patients in the United States found the prevalence of chronic HBV was 8 percent among unvaccinated participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, the rates of <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HBV</span> coinfection vary according to geographic region and are highest in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where most transmission occurs perinatally and horizontally. In developed countries, laboratory markers of prior HBV infection are more common in men who have sex with men (MSM) and injection drug users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC HBV INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV-infected patients should have routine testing for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B is made the same way in HIV-infected patients as in HIV-seronegative patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A detailed discussion on the diagnosis of HBV infection is found elsewhere and is summarized below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B surface antigen &ndash; HBsAg is the serologic hallmark of HBV infection and appears in serum 1 to 10 weeks after acute exposure to HBV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69344 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60627 \">table 1</a>). This is followed by detection of IgM and then IgG anti-HBc. Most adult patients clear HBsAg and develop anti-HBs consistent with resolved infection. Persistence of HBsAg for more than six months implies chronic infection, which is associated with the presence of viremia as measured by HBV DNA. Patients with the presence of HBsAg require further laboratory evaluation as described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B e antigen &ndash; Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is a marker of HBV replication and infectivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The presence of HBeAg is usually associated with high levels of HBV DNA in serum and active liver disease. Seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe is usually associated with declines in serum HBV DNA and remission of liver disease. However, some patients continue to have active liver disease and high levels of HBV DNA in serum after loss of HBeAg (HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis). The latter patients may have HBV variants that abolish or decrease the production of detectable HBeAg in serum. Thus, it is important for all patients who are HBsAg positive to have testing of HBV DNA regardless of HBeAg status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aminotransferase levels &ndash; Patients with chronic hepatitis B are also categorized according to the level of their aminotransferases: normal, &lt;2 times, or &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal. Higher levels of aminotransferases tend to be associated with more active liver disease and thus are influential in determining the <span class=\"nowrap\">benefits/risks</span> of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B DNA &ndash; Higher HBV DNA levels are associated with increased risk for progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Thus, HBV DNA is also used when considering treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis D serology &ndash; Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a defective virus that requires HBV to coexist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis B infection should have an assay for anti-HDV at the initial visit or in the context of severe hepatic flares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Those who are anti-HDV positive should be tested for HDV RNA. In chronic HDV infection, markers of HBV replication are usually absent, and the patient is typically HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ISOLATED ANTI-HB CORE ANTIBODY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Past exposure to hepatitis B virus is suggested by the presence of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs).

In a study of 651 HIV-infected patients who were screened for the presence of anti-HBs and HBsAg, the following results were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 387 subjects who tested negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, 142 patients underwent further serologic testing.

During follow-up, changes in HBV serological markers were demonstrated in one-quarter of the patients. Among the 179 patients with isolated anti-HBc at baseline, 45 percent had persistence of this profile, 41 percent acquired anti-HBs, 10 percent lost anti-HBc, and 4 percent developed HBsAg. Those patients who gained anti-HBs had a significantly greater CD4 T-cell gain in response to ART than those who had persistence of an isolated anti-HBc pattern (223 versus 83 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> after 24 months of ART).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent study in 282 HIV-infected patients and 40 HIV-seronegative patients over a median of 7.5 years found that 71 percent retained an isolated anti-HBc status, 20 percent acquired antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, and 2 percent acquired hepatitis B surface antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a multivariate analysis, use of potent ART was a significant predictor of anti-HBs acquisition, whereas women with hepatitis C viremia were more likely to retain their isolated anti-HBc status.</p><p/><p>The utility of hepatitis B vaccination in patients with isolated core antibody has been studied, and data support that individuals with isolated anti-HBc should be vaccinated against hepatitis B virus. A more detailed discussion of HBV vaccination in HIV-infected patients is found elsewhere.

The mechanisms leading to occult infection are unknown, but may include escape of immune recognition of changes in the S protein, methylation or disruption of key regulatory regions in the HBV genome, or modification of post-translational mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p>The clinical impact of occult HBV is unclear, but flares of aminotransferases, advanced fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma have been associated. These patients may also more likely than persons with anti-HBs to have a flare of HBV when receiving immunosuppressive medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with isolated anti-HBc, there are conflicting data on the prevalence of occult HBV viremia. Some studies have found a less than 2 percent prevalence of HBV viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. By contrast, in a report in which HBV DNA was sampled repeatedly over time, viremia was detected in 51 of 57 patients in at least one specimen over a mean of 31 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These disparate findings may be explained in part by transient viremia that is best captured with serial examinations and by variable sensitivity of the HBV DNA assays used in the reported studies. Occult HBV has also been uncommonly described in HIV-infected patients without any serologic markers of HBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of hepatitis due to HBV is mainly immune-mediated and not due to cytopathic effects of the virus.

By contrast, patients who develop chronic hepatitis B infection have narrowly focused T-cell responses.</p><p>Although recovery from acute hepatitis B is associated with lifelong protective immunity, trace amounts of virus can be detected with sensitive techniques such as polymerase chain reaction. This suggests that residual virus is controlled by cellular and humoral immune responses and that viremia can reemerge in the setting of immunosuppression. As an example, patients receiving chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression can experience reactivation of HBV replication and hepatitis flares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p>Spontaneous serum aminotransferase flares during chronic HBV infection have been attributed to changes in the balance between immunologic responses to HBV and quantitative variations in viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In another study of 2536 HIV-infected individuals who initiated potent antiretroviral therapy, both chronic and resolved hepatitis B infection were associated with a significantly increased risk for AIDS or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">HBV AND IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms &quot;immune reconstitution&quot; or &quot;immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot; (IRIS) describe a collection of inflammatory disorders associated with paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes following the initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected individuals. In HIV-infected patients with HBV, interpretation of IRIS is complicated by the concurrent treatment of HBV infection (by using HBV-active ART) and the potential for ART-related direct hepatotoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'HBV and risk of drug induced hepatotoxicity'</a> below.)</p><p>Since HBV is an immunologically mediated disease, immune reconstitution with ART can alter the balance between host-viral interactions and modify the natural history of hepatitis B. Although this shift may temporarily exacerbate liver inflammation, and even cause liver failure, the long-term net effect of treating both infections is positive. </p><p>In a prospective study of 36 treatment-naive patients initiating ART, baseline HBV DNA and ALT levels were significantly higher in the eight patients who developed hepatic flare (defined as ALT &gt;5x ULN or &gt;200 from baseline) than in those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In a retrospective study of 394 patients initiating ART, 10 of 28 subjects who were coinfected with hepatitis B lost HBeAg in association with a transient hepatitis flare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Immune reconstitution in this scenario is associated with marked clinical benefit since loss of HBeAg is usually associated with declining viremia. HBV seroconversion has occurred after profound improvement in immune responses secondary to ART, even in the absence of effective HBV therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>CD8+ T-cell responses to HBV antigens that might produce such a change were evaluated in a study of HIV seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients who had markers of resolved HBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. HIV infection was associated with a reduction in HBV-specific T-cell responses. The initiation of ART led to restoration of some functionally active T-cell responses. Furthermore, in patients who receive ART containing an agent with activity against HBV, T-cell responsiveness has been associated with reductions in HBV viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>The improvement in HBV-specific T cell responses may involve two distinct processes: the reconstitution of responses associated with a reduction in HBV viremia; and the slow restoration of the immune system that occurs with suppression of HIV replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].
