One of the rationales for atherosclerosis imaging originates from autopsy studies in adolescents and young adults, which revealed that atherosclerosis is present early in life and precedes the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Consequently, using imaging to detect early atherosclerosis has the potential to define the status and predict the risk of future cardiovascular events, as well as evaluate cardiovascular drug efficacy. One of the most widely used and best validated atherosclerosis imaging techniques is the ultrasound carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement.</p><p>The techniques for imaging and measuring CIMT along with the potential clinical applications of CIMT will be discussed. Carotid artery imaging for the detection of significant obstruction carotid disease is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9889100\"><span class=\"h1\">CIMT MEASUREMENT BY ULTRASOUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CIMT can be measured using either high resolution ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At present, carotid ultrasound has provided the majority of imaging data and, with its increasing availability, MRI has emerged as the technology with novel applications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9533989\"><span class=\"h2\">Image acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large superficial arteries, in particular the carotid arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F93655\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93655 \">figure 1</a>), can be visualized at high resolution with B-mode (or &quot;brightness&quot; mode) ultrasound using linear array transducers for superficial and vascular structures (typically broadband transducers with frequency ranges 5 to 15 MHz and a high signal to noise ratio are used). The spatial resolution obtained with these transducers is on the order of 0.05 mm axially and 0.2 mm laterally. In most scan protocols, carotid ultrasound images are obtained from the near and far walls of the right and left distal common carotid arteries, the carotid bifurcation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91735\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91735 \">image 1</a>), and the proximal internal carotid arterial segments. CIMT in an individual patient is therefore often a composite of intima-media thickness measurements of various arterial segments, sometimes under multiple angles of insonation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-safety-of-diagnostic-ultrasound-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and safety of diagnostic ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;, section on 'Resolution'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9889174\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For CIMT measurements, longitudinal images of the carotid arteries are obtained in which the leading edges of the lumen-intima and media-adventitia interfaces (the &quot;double-line pattern&quot;) of the arterial wall represent intima-media complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91735\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91735 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Typically, normal common carotid CIMT at age 10 is approximately 0.4 to 0.5 mm, while from the fifth decade of life onward this progresses to 0.7 to 0.8 mm or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Since the arterial walls are submillimeter structures, performing CIMT measurements requires experience and craftsmanship, and standardized image acquisition is paramount. Sonographers should be well trained, and standardized ultrasound equipment and protocols should be used. Furthermore, image analysis should preferably be done offline, with dedicated software using standardized protocols and performed by expert technicians. Moreover, quality control results of scans and feedback to sonographers must have a rapid turnaround. Under these conditions, ultrasound CIMT measurement has excellent interscan as well as inter- and intraobserver reproducibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9534044\"><span class=\"h2\">Applications for CIMT measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The suggested indications for CIMT measurement have included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for atherosclerosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk stratification for future cardiovascular disease-related events</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of drug efficacy</p><p/><p>The corresponding data for each of these indications along with recommendations regarding the use of CIMT measurement for each indication are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9889193\"><span class=\"h3\">CIMT for cardiovascular risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular risk prediction in asymptomatic individuals is based on risk scores. Although guidelines have based risk assessment on the use of multivariate risk models, their ability to predict future cardiovascular events has limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In fact, a high percentage of cardiovascular events occur in persons at low and intermediate risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. CIMT has been proposed as a potential tool to aid cardiovascular risk stratification as it comprises a direct measure of atherosclerosis, is associated with future cardiovascular events, and is a safe, inexpensive, and widely available technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Our approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9889206\"><span class=\"h4\">CIMT and future cardiovascular events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients without known cardiovascular disease (CVD), composite measures of CIMT of various segments, with or without the presence of atherosclerotic plaque, result in modest but statistically significant increases in net reclassification improvement when added to risk estimates based on traditional risk factors or risk models. Whether the improvement in risk stratification due to CIMT and plaque information translates into measurable health benefits for individuals or populations, or reductions in the cost of care, has not been established. Until additional data are available that directly correlate CIMT measurement with improvements in hard outcomes (ie, death, myocardial infarction, stroke), we do <strong>not</strong> recommend routine CIMT measurement.</p><p>Numerous prospective epidemiological studies have shown that CIMT is a predictor of future cardiovascular events, independent of traditional risk factors. In addition, two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reviewed the one-time and serial use of CIMT for CVD risk prediction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-time CIMT measurement &ndash; In a systematic review and meta-analysis on the individual data of 14 studies of 45,828 asymptomatic individuals who underwent one-time CIMT measurement at baseline (median follow-up 10.8 years), the hazard ratio (per 0.10 mm adjusted mean common CIMT difference) for first myocardial infarction and stroke was 1.09 (95% CI, 1.07-1.12), for first myocardial infarction 1.08 (95% CI, 1.05-1.10), and for first stroke 1.12 (95% CI, 1.10-1.15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. CIMT measures of other carotid artery segments and the presence of plaque showed similar relationships with future cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While a one-time CIMT measurement can provide some predictive value for CVD risk assessment, we do <strong>not</strong> routinely perform CIMT measurement in most patients, preferring to use a standard cardiovascular risk assessment model based on traditional cardiac risk factors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial CIMT measurements &ndash; In a systematic review and meta-analysis on the individual data of 16 studies of 36,984 patients without known CVD who underwent serial CIMT measurement (mean follow-up seven years), in which the yearly progression rates were calculated for various CIMT measures (mean and maximum CIMT values of the common, bifurcation, and internal carotid arteries), there was no association between progression of CIMT and future events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While CIMT progression was not helpful, baseline CIMT measures were independent predictors of future cardiovascular events, similar to the findings in the other meta-analysis. While there are various potential methodological as well as biological explanations, there is no proof of a relation between CIMT progression and future cardiovascular events. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of this, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend the use of serial CIMT measurements for the purpose of CVD risk assessment.</p><p/><p>Although CIMT independently predicts future cardiovascular events, some issues need to be addressed before CIMT can be considered for cardiovascular risk stratification. First, the addition of CIMT needs to show improvement in cardiovascular risk stratification when added to traditional risk scores, as expressed by improvement in the net reclassification index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Second, an improvement by CIMT in cardiovascular risk stratification should translate into a measurable health benefit and should be cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Regarding the added value of mean common CIMT to the Framingham 10-year risk prediction of myocardial infarction and stroke, the previously mentioned meta-analysis showed a net reclassification improvement in all subjects of 0.8 percent, and in subjects at intermediate risk of 3.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This minimal increase in net reclassification following the addition of mean common CIMT to the Framingham risk predictor was not felt to be useful for cardiovascular risk stratification.</p><p>Net reclassification improvement has also been investigated for CIMT measurement of other segments of the carotid arteries with mixed results. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ARIC study of 13,145 participants without known CVD, mean CIMT of all segments did show an improvement in reclassification of 7.1 percent in all subjects and 16.7 percent in subjects at intermediate risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similar results were found in the IMPROVE study of 3703 asymptomatic subjects with at least three CVD risk factors, in which the net reclassification improvement in all subjects was 11.3 percent for mean CIMT and 10.5 percent for mean maximum CIMT of all segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, in the CAPS study in 4904 participants without known CVD, CIMT of each of the different segments (common, bifurcation, and internal carotid) did not result in an increase in the net reclassification improvement when added to traditional risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>The effect of the presence of plaque (defined as maximum CIMT &gt;1.5 mm) on risk classification has also been investigated. In the ARIC study mentioned above, the addition of presence of plaque to traditional risk factors increased the net reclassification improvement by 7.7 percent in all subjects and 17.7 percent in subjects at intermediate risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

As such, CIMT is <strong>not</strong> routinely used in clinical practice to monitor the effects of medical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12018660\"><span class=\"h4\">Lipid-lowering therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With regard to lipid-lowering medications, various placebo-controlled CIMT studies in the 1990s showed that atherosclerosis progression was retarded by statin use in patients with cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].<sup> </sup>Subsequently, aggressive lipid lowering with statins also showed markedly reduced CIMT progression when compared with moderate lipid lowering with statins, which was consistent with subsequent observations in clinical end point studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Furthermore, several CIMT trials revealed a beneficial effect of statins on atherosclerosis progression in asymptomatic subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>] and proved safe and sensitive enough to pick up efficacious benefits of statin treatment, even at a very young age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In addition to statins, the efficacy of numerous non-statin lipid-modifying medications on atherosclerosis progression, as measured by CIMT, has been evaluated (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b3-niacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">niacin</a>, pactimibe, torcetrapib, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/4,31-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31-37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12018666\"><span class=\"h4\">Anti-hypertensive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of various antihypertensive drugs on atherosclerosis, as measured by CIMT, have also been reported in numerous trials.

In one study that investigated the agreement between the outcome of CIMT drug efficacy trials and morbidity and mortality studies investigating the same drug, the positive and negative predictive values of a CIMT trial to predict the outcome of a morbidity and mortality trial were 96 and 83 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

However, given the additional complexity and cost of MRI when compared with ultrasound, CIMT measurement should <strong>not</strong> primarily be performed with MRI in most patients. </p><p>MRI does possess a number of important characteristics that make it well suited for the visualization of atherosclerosis. First, MRI is noninvasive, safe, and no ionizing radiation is involved. Second, MRI enables imaging of all stages of atherosclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91736\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91736 \">image 2</a>), from healthy vessels to advanced disease in submillimeter resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. Furthermore, disparities in the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1), the spin-spin relaxation time (T2), and the proton density (PD) enable discrimination of plaque components such as intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid-rich necrotic core, and calcification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91736\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91736 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. MRI of vessel wall thickness as well as imaging of plaque size and composition is highly reproducible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/65,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,67</a>]. </p><p>The predictive value of carotid vessel wall thickness measurement by MRI for future cardiovascular events is currently unknown. However, MRI of vessel wall thickness is highly correlated with ultrasound carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), so it is reasonable to expect that the predictive value of both modalities will be in the same order of magnitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Several smaller studies have been conducted to investigate the relation between plaque size and composition and future cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>].

Furthermore, atherosclerosis imaging with MRI has shown to be a valuable modality for the assessment of atherosclerosis progression in specific patient populations, as well as for the assessment of cardiovascular drug efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-intima-media-thickness/abstract/74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-78</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9889243\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a widely available, safe, and reproducible measure when performed by trained and certified sonographers with standardized equipment.
