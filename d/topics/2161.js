However, metastatic prostate cancer remains an important clinical problem, both in terms of the number of affected men and its impact on quality of life.</p><p>The bones of the axial skeleton are the predominant site of metastasis in most men with metastatic prostate cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83138\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83138 \">image 1</a>), and these lesions can cause pain, debility, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functional impairment. The clinical manifestations and diagnostic assessment of bone metastases in men with prostate cancer are reviewed here.</p><p>An overview of bone metastases is presented separately, as is a discussion of the management of prostate cancer bone metastases.

However, metastases preferentially develop in the bones of the axial skeleton, where red marrow is most abundant. The reasons for this pattern of metastasis are unclear, but the leading hypothesis focuses on symbiotic interactions between prostate cancer cells and bone stromal cells, such as osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and fibroblasts. </p><p>The bone metastases in men with prostate cancer are usually osteoblastic (ie, characterized by new bone formation). However, increases in bone resorption have been consistently demonstrated histologically and biochemically. Bone destruction is an important factor in the etiology of pain and other complications due to bone metastases, although it is unclear if such bone destruction precedes the development of osteoblastic metastases or is a consequence of increased bone formation.</p><p>The mechanisms by which prostate cancer tumor cells induce osteoblastic changes are unclear but are thought to involve excess activation of osteoblast mitogens, some of which are derived from bone stroma (insulin-like growth factors, transforming growth factor-beta, bone-morphogenic proteins, proteases, fibroblast growth factors, endothelin, other soluble factors) and others from the prostate cancer itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-bone-metastases#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of bone metastases&quot;, section on 'Osteoblastic metastases'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19253279\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone is the predominant site of disseminated prostate cancer in men who present with or subsequently develop metastatic disease. Although bone metastases are often asymptomatic initially, patients can eventually develop complications that require treatment; these skeletal-related complications include pain requiring irradiation, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, and occasionally, abnormalities of calcium metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102891787\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is the most common manifestation of bone metastases. Pain from bone metastases is typically insidious in onset and slowly increases in severity over weeks to months. However, there are exceptions, such as a pathologic fracture or the sudden onset of back pain that accompanies the collapse of a cancer-containing vertebral body.</p><p>Although bone pain due to metastasis is commonly described as aching (like a toothache), nerve root entrapment, a common complication associated with vertebral metastases, may cause a burning <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiating type of pain. </p><p>Pain located distal to the knees or elbows is less likely to be malignant than that located proximally or centrally because cancers typically spread to bone areas with active marrow function. Arthritic pain is more likely to localize to joints than pain from bone metastases, but history alone cannot reliably distinguish the two. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Uncontrolled pain due to bone metastases results in unnecessary suffering, decreased ability to cope with illness, interference with activities of daily living, and can necessitate extended or repeat hospital admissions. Uncontrolled pain may also delay or disrupt anticancer treatment, compromising its effectiveness.

Although prostate cancer bone metastases are typically osteoblastic, the structure of osteoblastic bone may be abnormal, and there is usually a significant destruction of normal bone cortex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99120\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99120 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>Systemic treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can contribute to osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures. Osteoporotic fractures need to be distinguished from those pathologic fractures caused by bone metastasis.

Such metastases can cause spinal cord compression and severe neurologic deficits. </p><p>Pain is usually the first symptom of spinal cord compression, and this generally precedes the development of other symptoms by weeks or even months. A focused neurologic examination is required in men with back pain because of the risk of epidural spinal cord compression. Symptoms occurring later can include motor weakness, sensory findings, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and ataxia.

Hypocalcemia is more frequent but is generally asymptomatic. Hypocalcemia may also be due to treatment with bone modifying agents (bisphosphonates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>).

However, these laboratory abnormalities are not useful in either establishing or ruling out the diagnosis of bone metastasis in men with prostate cancer.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum PSA is typically &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in men with metastatic well-differentiated or moderately differentiated tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, some prostate cancers produce little PSA, and lower or even normal PSA values do not exclude bone metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-in-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Prostate cancer with low PSA production'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoblastic metastases are commonly but not inevitably accompanied by elevations in markers of bone turnover (eg, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary hydroxyproline, urinary deoxypyridinoline). However, these are not routinely measured clinically. Although serial measurement of biochemical bone markers may not be useful in men with metastatic prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], a significant decline in bone-derived alkaline phosphatase is a reasonably reliable indicator of a favorable therapeutic response. In addition, high levels of bone-associated alkaline phosphatase are associated with a greater risk of adverse skeletal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. Because elevated serum alkaline phosphatase can be derived from bone or liver, further evaluation to distinguish the site of origin may be warranted.

However, anemia may also be caused by a variety of factors, including ADT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or a combination of poorly defined tumor-related factors.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538652437\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency of skeletal-related events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of progression to metastatic disease at presentation, and hence the risk of subsequently developing bone metastases, is a function of multiple factors, which are incorporated into the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. In a prospective study looking at the risk of future bone metastases, the most important factor for men with castrate resistant prostate cancer and non-metastatic disease was a rapidly rising PSA and a baseline PSA of &gt;13.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The incidence of such events in men with castrate resistant prostate cancer who have developed bone metastases was illustrated by a trial in which 1901 patients were randomly assigned to osteoclast inhibition with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The median times to first skeletal-related event were 17 and 21 months, respectively. For the entire cohort, the frequencies of bone pain requiring radiation therapy, pathologic fracture, and spinal cord compression were 20, 15, and 3 percent, respectively. In these studies, pathologic fracture rates were assessed by skeletal surveys rather than symptoms. In more recent studies that used symptoms rather than skeletal surveys to detect pathologic fractures, the risk of pathologic fracture was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538652451\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is the most common manifestation of bone metastases.
