Also known as &quot;enhanced recovery protocols&quot; (ERP) or &quot;fast-track surgery,&quot; ERAS programs typically include multidisciplinary and multimodal interventions aimed at minimizing the physiologic changes associated with surgery. Patient benefits associated with ERAS include reduction in postoperative opioid use and length of stay.</p><p>This topic will review ERAS programs as they apply to gynecologic surgery with a planned overnight stay, although many elements of the ERAS programs discussed here can be adapted for same-day major gynecologic surgery, such as same-day hysterectomy.

Other elements of the bundle included patient education, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol preparation of the planned area of incision, re-dosing of the prophylactic antibiotic at three to four hours following incision, sterile closing tray, staff glove change for abdominal wall closure, dressing removal at 24 to 48 hours postoperatively, postoperative showering at home with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, and follow-up phone call by a nurse. As noted above, some practices provide the patient with the chlorhexidine cleansing soap or wipes to be used prior to surgery.

Other potential analgesic modalities include infiltration of the surgical site with local anesthetic, the possible use of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks, or the possible use of neuraxial anesthesia (spinal or thoracic epidural anesthesia). In a systematic review of 46 studies assessing the role of nonopioid preoperative analgesia in women undergoing hysterectomy, patients treated with preoperative acetaminophen, gabapentin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> (regional or local infiltration), and phenothiazine used less opioid compared with women treated with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-recovery-after-gynecologic-surgery-components-and-implementation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Multimodal perioperative analgesia is a truly interdisciplinary ERAS intervention determined by both surgeons and anesthesiologists prior to the surgery. Potential interventions for consideration include the types of preoperative analgesia, quickest approach for the intended surgery, and opportunities to minimize physiologic disruption (eg, blood loss).</p><p>Importantly, elements of ERAS pathways will continue to evolve as new evidence emerges.

Although data directly comparing liposomal bupivacaine use in direct surgical site infiltration versus liposomal bupivacaine use in TAP blocks remains limited, surgical site infiltration with liposomal bupivacaine is a low-risk intervention that appears to work synergistically within ERAS pathways to lower need for opioid analgesics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-recovery-after-gynecologic-surgery-components-and-implementation/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] and has anecdotally worked well compared with ERAS alone in patients undergoing laparotomy at one author's institution.</p><p>Neuraxial anesthesia (ie, spinal or epidural anesthesia) has demonstrated efficacy regarding improved pain control and reduced postoperative opioid consumption in open gynecologic surgery.

For patients on an ERAS pathway, it is helpful to identify any potential barriers to discharge prior to surgery when known, or as soon as feasible following surgery. It is the authors' practice to identify for the nursing staff all patients planned to undergo discharge on postoperative day 1 using a &quot;predischarge&quot; or &quot;conditional discharge&quot; order so that the nursing and case management teams can ensure that discharge readiness goals are met. At the time of discharge, patient education is conducted by the nursing team, which consists of a review of the elements discussed preoperatively. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125666338\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to conventional postoperative office visits with the surgeon, a follow-up telephone call shortly after the patient&rsquo;s arrival home can decrease patient anxiety, answer questions, review instructions, provide reassurance, identify potential problems or complications as they arise, facilitate the patient&rsquo;s transition from the hospital to the home environment, and potentially reduce preventable calls to the hospital <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emergency room visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-recovery-after-gynecologic-surgery-components-and-implementation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Importantly, elements of ERAS pathways will continue to evolve as new evidence emerges. (See <a href=\"#H3448018794\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing planned gynecologic surgery with an overnight stay are candidates for participation in an ERAS protocol. Although an ERAS pathway can broadly apply to the majority of patients undergoing gynecologic surgery, such a pathway should always be individualized when and where medically indicated.

Both the anesthesia team and surgeons perform interventions aimed at perioperative pain control. Potential ERAS interventions for the anesthesia team also include use of short-acting anesthetic agents, standardized ventilation strategies, standardized prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting, maintenance of normothermia and euvolemia, and avoidance (or intraoperative removal) of nasogastric tubes. Surgeons are advised to perform the least invasive surgery to address the problem.
