Starting doses from the lower end of the recommended range should be used to avoid initial agitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77409 \">table 1</a>). Time to onset of clinically meaningful action for an SRI varies by patient, but averages approximately four weeks. The initial therapeutic dose should be continued for four to six weeks. If the patient does not show a robust response the SRI should be increased in one- to two-week increments until sufficient improvement is seen or the maximum recommended or highest tolerated dose is reached. &#160;</p><p>As an example, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> can be initiated at 25 mg per day.

Tolerance, withdrawal, and dependence are possible, but pregabalin is generally less addictive and better tolerated than benzodiazepines (schedule IV).

All three treatment groups showed greater improvement compared with placebo.

Information on the efficacy and delivery of specific psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies for GAD are described separately. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients newly diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), we recommend initial treatment with either a serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or both, rather than other treatments (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3385476\" class=\"local\">'Choosing between CBT and medication'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with GAD, selection between CBT and medication can be based on treatment availability and patient preference. Patients with GAD co-occurring with severe depression may be too symptomatic to fully engage and participate in CBT. In such cases, we would favor initial treatment with an SRI with or without CBT. (See <a href=\"#H4074982256\" class=\"local\">'Patients with co-occurring conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual CBT for patients with GAD is generally provided in 10 to 15 60-minute sessions, but can include additional sessions depending on the patient&rsquo;s level of severity, the presence of comorbidity, patient resistance to the treatment approach, therapist competence, and the number of components incorporated into CBT. (See <a href=\"#H387065\" class=\"local\">'Patient preference for CBT'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults#H2749373658\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Administration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with GAD treated with medication, we suggest first-line treatment with an SRI (either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) rather than other medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The selection of a specific SRI can be customized to the patient based on the drug&rsquo;s side effect profile, drug-drug interactions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">history/preference</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77409 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H1277299713\" class=\"local\">'No response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who experience a partial response to the maximally tolerated SRI dose (or no response to two SRIs), we suggest augmentation of the SRI with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buspirone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buspirone</a> rather than other medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Reasonable alternatives would be SRI augmentation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77409 \">table 1</a>) or with CBT. Buspirone or pregabalin can also be used as monotherapy in nondepressed patients who respond minimally to an SRI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tolerate the drug&rsquo;s side effects poorly. (See <a href=\"#H387071\" class=\"local\">'Response to first-line medication'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults#H537939850\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Buspirone'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A benzodiazepine, started at a low dose and titrated to an effective dose, is a reasonable treatment option for GAD patients without a history of a substance use disorder (SUD) who have not responded to the previously described medications. Adjunctive benzodiazepine treatment can be particularly useful to treat the agitation or insomnia that can occur in the first weeks of SRI treatment, or the GAD symptoms that remain despite SRI treatment. Information on benzodiazepine dosing is described in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65653 \">table 2</a>).

Nonabusable alternatives for the treatment of insomnia in GAD patients with an SUD history include the sedating antihistamine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a> or a sedating anticonvulsant, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77409 \">table 1</a>).
