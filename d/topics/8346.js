A collapsing form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with associated tubular microcysts and interstitial inflammation is the classic form of HIV-related kidney disease, known as HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIV infection has also been associated with other forms of kidney disease, in particular, immune complex disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. With prolonged survival and aging of the population, HIV-positive individuals are also at increasing risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to comorbid conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension.</p><p>Some of these kidney diseases can result in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Issues relating to HIV and dialysis will be reviewed here. HIV-related disorders of the kidney are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of kidney disease in HIV-positive patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with the general population, HIV-positive individuals are at increased risk for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In a population-based cohort study from Denmark, HIV-positive individuals had a fourfold higher risk of ESRD compared with age- and gender-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system have demonstrated that the risk of ESRD is associated with both HIV-related factors (high HIV-RNA, low CD4, and hepatitis C virus coinfection) and traditional kidney disease risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A subsequent study from the VA suggests that ESRD may occur at a younger age in HIV-positive versus HIV-negative veterans, although the difference is small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Both HIV-related factors and traditional kidney disease risk factors were also associated with a combined endpoint of ESRD and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) in two large HIV cohort studies, D:A:D and EuroSIDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In a smaller, retrospective cohort study from Germany, injection drug use and black race were the only independent risk factors for ESRD in HIV-positive adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Over the 20-year study period, these authors observed a decline in the prevalence of ESRD among HIV-positive individuals of black race and an increase in the prevalence of ESRD among HIV-positive individuals of white race, although the racial disparity in ESRD risk remained significant.</p><p>Data from the VA health care system and from the Johns Hopkins HIV cohort have also demonstrated a striking disparity in the risk of ESRD among HIV-positive individuals of black race, who may have as much as a 30-fold increase in the risk of ESRD compared with HIV-positive individuals of white race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In the VA cohort, the risk of ESRD among HIV-positive blacks was similar to that observed among diabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Genetic variability in the apolipoprotein L1 (<em>APOL1</em>) gene on chromosome 22 appears to account for a significant proportion of the racial disparity in ESRD risk, including the risk of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) and other forms of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].

Unfortunately, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 2728 form, which is used to collect data for the USRDS, no longer collects data on HIV status, unless ESRD is attributed to HIVAN (documented as &quot;AIDS nephropathy&quot; on the 2728 form). As a result, the USRDS no longer provides nationally representative data on the prevalence of HIV infection in the US dialysis population.</p><p>According to the USRDS, 800 to 900 new cases of ESRD are attributed to HIVAN each year in the US, predominantly among individuals of black race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. While the annual incidence of ESRD attributed to HIVAN has remained relatively stable, the prevalence continues to rise with increases in patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The true prevalence of HIVAN in the ESRD population is difficult to determine as definitive diagnosis requires kidney biopsy.

As long as health care workers follow standard dialysis unit precautions, we also feel that no special isolation of HIV-positive dialysis patients is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient-to-patient transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, patient-to-patient transmission of HIV infection has not been reported in a dialysis unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, at least four well-documented outbreaks of patient-to-patient HIV transmission have occurred in hemodialysis units outside of the United States, including Argentina (two centers), Colombia, and Egypt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Seroconversion was documented in 9 of 13 patients in the Colombian unit and 24 of 39 patients in the Egyptian center. When compared with HIV-positive local controls, nucleotide sequence analyses in nearly half of these cases were consistent with a common source of exposure.</p><p>The most likely causes of transmission were breaches in infection-control protocol; however, no single activity could be implicated. Possibilities included reuse of the dialyzer, blood lines, and needles for different patients; the use of a weak chemical germicide (benzalkonium chloride) to reprocess needles; contamination of the ports connecting the dialysis machine to the blood lines; and the use of a contaminated multidose heparin vial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Needlestick transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of HIV seroconversion after a needlestick injury is estimated to be 3 in 1000 or 0.3 percent. By comparison, the estimated risk of transmission after a similar event is 6 to 30 percent and 2 percent for hepatitis B and C virus, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The larger the blood inoculum, the deeper the percutaneous injury, and the later the stage of HIV infection in the source patient, the greater the risk of HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Postexposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be offered to exposed health care workers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of healthcare personnel exposed to HIV&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Education of all health care workers, staff, and trainees in standard infection-control procedures and needlestick protocols is essential. Although rare, documented patient-to-patient and patient-to-health care worker HIV transmission in the dialysis environment makes routine HIV screening valuable in detecting outbreaks and assisting in the decision to initiate postexposure prophylaxis. Adherence to dialysis unit precautions should minimize the risk of HIV transmission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral levels in ultrafiltrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of evidence relating to the presence or absence of HIV in hemodialysis ultrafiltrate. In one study of 10 ART-treated patients, slightly lower levels of virus were detected in blood post-hemodialysis as compared with predialysis levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]; however, no viral RNA was detectable in the ultrafiltrate. The authors hypothesized that the absence of HIV in the ultrafiltrate could be explained by viral adherence to the dialysis membrane.</p><p>HIV virus that is capable of replication is recoverable from peritoneal dialysis effluent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. One study found that HIV was recoverable at room temperature for up to seven days in peritoneal dialysis drainage bags and up to 48 hours from dry tubing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. No difference in viral recovery was demonstrated between 1.5, 2.5, and 4.25 percent dextrose solutions. Because survival of replication-competent HIV requires an intracellular environment, the presence of peritonitis may increase the duration of HIV viability within peritoneal dialysis effluent.</p><p>The clinical significance of replication-competent HIV in the peritoneal dialysis effluent is unknown. Although no case of HIV transmission via peritoneal dialysis effluent has been described, the fluid poses a theoretical biological risk to disposal workers and medical personnel. Dilutions to 1:512 of both 10 percent bleach and 50 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> (Amukin) are effective in preventing HIV recoverability in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], while household bleach is too dilute to serve as a disinfectant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ISSUES RELATED TO DIALYSIS MODALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no strong evidence to suggest that one dialysis modality is superior, and both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis should be considered in HIV-positive individuals approaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>There are several issues unique to the specific dialysis modality utilized among patients infected with HIV.

While contemporary data are limited, early arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation is recommended in all HIV-positive patients who are approaching ESRD and who plan to use hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. When an AVF is not technically feasible, we advocate creation of an AVG rather than a tunneled, cuffed catheter since the latter confers an even higher infection rate regardless of HIV status.

Among patients of black race, HIV monoinfection was also associated with higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p>Long-term exposure to ART has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in HIV-positive dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Regimens containing protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), in particular, have been associated with metabolic abnormalities and endothelial dysfunction, and increasing exposure to specific agents has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction in large cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-56</a>]. While the NRTI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> has received the most attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/53,54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54,56</a>], pooled data from premarketing clinical trials of abacavir did not demonstrate any excess risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], and data from a large, collaborative cohort study have also implicated several other ART agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The potential for additive cardiovascular risk in ESRD patients should be balanced against the known benefits of ART.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With improved survival and better long-term prognosis, kidney transplantation has emerged as an important consideration in HIV-positive patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The potential for significant interactions between calcineurin inhibitors and antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires close communication between the transplant team and HIV providers. Kidney transplantation in patients with HIV infection is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in dialysis patients is difficult to estimate and appears to vary in part based on the local HIV seroprevalence. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend voluntary, confidential HIV testing of all dialysis patients. Potential benefits of routine screening include improved patient survival, possible reversal of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), and implementation of measures to prevent transmission to partners. However, compared with low-risk patient populations, routine HIV testing in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may be associated with an increased incidence of false-positive results. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Human immunodeficiency virus testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV transmission in the dialysis setting, which is rare, can be avoided by strict adherence to standard infection-control procedures. In agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we feel that no special isolation of HIV-positive dialysis patients is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Transmission in the dialysis unit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the single most important intervention for an HIV-positive patient with ESRD. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with the reversal of HIVAN and with decreased mortality in dialysis patients. However, inappropriate dosing of ART is common in dialysis patients and may be associated with inadequate virologic control or with medication toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Antiretroviral therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wyatt CM, Winston JA, Malvestutto CD, et al.
