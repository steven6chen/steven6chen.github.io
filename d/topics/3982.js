These type IV collagen alpha chains are normally located in various basement membranes of the kidney, cochlea, and eye. Abnormalities in these chains result in defective basement membranes at these sites, leading to the clinical features of this disorder (ie, progressive glomerular disease, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities).

Although the overall incidence in the general population is unknown, data from the United States demonstrates Alport syndrome accounts for 3 percent of children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 0.2 percent of adults with ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Among children undergoing renal biopsy the incidence of Alport syndrome has varied from 1 to 12 percent depending upon the indication for biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/1,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-7</a>].</p><p>The gene frequency of Alport syndrome in the United States has been estimated at 1:5000 to 10,000, suggesting there are approximately 30,000 to 60,000 affected individuals in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classical presentation of Alport syndrome is based upon clinical manifestations of affected males with X-linked disease. These features include glomerular disease that progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), ocular abnormalities (eg, anterior lenticonus), sensorineural hearing loss, and a family history of hematuria associated with renal failure and deafness.</p><p>Clinical presentation and course in patients with autosomal recessive disease are similar to those with X-linked disease. Patients with autosomal dominant disease generally exhibit more gradual loss of renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Sensorineural hearing loss and ocular anomalies are common in the X-linked and autosomal recessive forms of Alport syndrome, but are unusual in patients with autosomal dominant disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial renal manifestation of Alport syndrome is asymptomatic persistent microscopic hematuria, which is present in early childhood in affected patients. Since screening urinalysis is seldom performed in routine pediatric primary care, microscopic hematuria may not be detected unless the patient is screened because of an affected family member or found as an incidental finding for another issue (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-microscopic-hematuria-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of microscopic hematuria in children&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria'</a>). Recurrent episodes of gross hematuria are not uncommon especially during childhood. Gross hematuria may be the initial presenting finding and often occurs after an upper respiratory infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Boys without hematuria by the age of 10 years are unlikely to have Alport syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with Alport syndrome have normal C3 levels.</p><p>In early childhood, the serum creatinine and blood pressure are normal. Over time, proteinuria, hypertension, and progressive renal insufficiency develop. ESRD usually occurs between the ages of 16 and 35 years in patients with X-linked or autosomal recessive disease. In some families, the course is more indolent with renal failure being delayed until age 45 to 60, especially in those with autosomal dominant Alport syndrome.</p><p>In females with X-linked Alport syndrome, recurrent episodes of gross hematuria, proteinuria, hearing loss, and diffuse glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening are associated with more severe renal dysfunction and ESRD at an earlier age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hearing loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss is common in patients with Alport syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hearing loss begins in the high frequency range and progresses over time to frequencies in the range of conversational speech. One study of families with X-linked disease reported that audiologic testing detected hearing loss in 85 percent of affected boys and 18 percent of female heterozygotes by 15 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

It occurs in 20 to 30 percent of males with X-linked Alport syndrome and is pathognomonic of the disease. Lenticonus can be complicated by the presence of subcapsular cataracts, which may lead to loss of visual acuity.

These findings are also specific for Alport syndrome.

Large rearrangements of the <em>COL</em>4<em>A</em>5 gene or any mutations that shift the reading frame of the gene were also associated with early onset of hearing loss and a higher incidence of anterior lenticonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the second study of 175 families from the United States, the average age of onset for ESRD for male patients with missense mutations, splice site mutations, and truncating mutations was 37, 28, and 25 years of age, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Mutations located closer to the 5' end of the gene were associated with a younger onset of ESRD, and an increased risk of ocular changes and hearing loss than those located closer to the 3' end.

They have a range of clinical findings due to lyonization, by which only one X chromosome is active per cell. As a result, approximately one-half of their cells will express the mutant <em>COL4A5</em> gene and the remaining cells the normal <em>COL4A5</em> gene, leading to a variable phenotype that is generally less severe than in affected males.</p><p>This was shown in a study of the natural history of female heterozygotes with proven <em>COL4A5</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Among female heterozygotes followed in 195 affected families, the incidence of ESRD before age 40 was only 12 percent, compared with 90 percent in affected males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. With increasing age, there was an increased risk of progressive renal disease with a 30 percent probability of developing ESRD by age 60 in these females. However, this may be an overestimate, since approximately one-third of the women, most likely less severely affected, were lost to follow-up. There was variation in phenotypes among family members with the same genotype, most likely due to the variability of gene expression due to lyonization.</p><p>Risk factors for chronic renal insufficiency in female heterozygotes include episodic gross hematuria in childhood, sensorineural deafness, proteinuria, and the presence of the characteristic lamellation of the basement membrane (GBM) associated with Alport syndrome on renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

However, in young patients, this characteristic appearance of a laminated GBM may not be present. In males with X-linked Alport syndrome, for example, the proportion of GBM showing splitting increases from about 30 percent by age 10 to more than 90 percent by age 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

For example, immunostaining demonstrates absence of staining of the alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 (IV) chains in the glomerular basement membrane in approximately two-thirds of male patients and discontinuous distribution in many affected females. Bowman's capsules and distal tubule basement membranes may also show abnormal immunostaining for the alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains.

If the protein is clearly absent in a male (or is clearly mosaic in a female), a diagnosis of Alport syndrome can be made without further testing. If the test demonstrates expression of the alpha-5(IV) chain, then the patient has one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mutation in the <em>COL4A5</em> gene that permits deposition of a functionally abnormal but antigenically normal alpha-5(IV) chain, which occurs in about 30 percent of male patients with X-linked disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autosomal Alport syndrome with abnormalities in either the <em>COL4A3</em> or <em>COL4A4</em> gene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another disorder.</p><p/><p>In these uncertain cases, the diagnosis of Alport syndrome can subsequently be confirmed or excluded by a renal biopsy with analysis of type IV collagen expression in the kidney.

Other glomerular disorders that present in children with microscopic hematuria include IgA nephropathy, in which the family history is usually negative; and so-called &quot;thin basement membrane nephropathy,&quot; in which the family history may be positive for hematuria but renal failure and deafness are absent. In addition, a normal C3 level differentiates patients with Alport syndrome from those with C3 glomerulonephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thin basement membrane nephropathy (benign familial hematuria)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isolated-and-persistent-glomerular-hematuria-iga-alport-thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isolated and persistent glomerular hematuria: IgA; Alport; thin basement membrane nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of Alport syndrome is confirmed by skin or renal biopsy or molecular genetic testing. Alport syndrome is distinguished by the presence of the characteristic finding of lamination of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in samples from a renal biopsy or abnormalities of type IV collagen by immunostaining, or by identification of mutation in <em>COL4A3, COL4A4, </em>or <em>COL4A5</em>. </p><p>Megathrombocytopenia (thrombocytopenia with large or giant platelets) has been described in some families with autosomal dominant Alport syndrome and sensorineural deafness. This complex has been referred to as Epstein syndrome, or Fechtner syndrome when associated with leukocyte cytoplasmic inclusions. These disorders have been mapped to chromosome 22, and result from mutations in the gene encoding nonmuscle myosin heavy chain 9 (<em>MYH9</em>). Mutations in this gene can also cause Sebastian syndrome, another giant platelet disorder, and nonsyndromic hereditary deafness. These disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-thrombocytopenia-in-children#H433560505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of thrombocytopenia in children&quot;, section on 'Large or giant platelets'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, Epstein and Fechtner syndromes represent distinct disorders arising from mutations in noncollagen genes, not variants of autosomal dominant Alport syndrome. In some patients, ultrastructural changes reminiscent of Alport syndrome may be present.
