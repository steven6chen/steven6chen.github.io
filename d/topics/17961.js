Testicular GCTs are divided into two groups: pure seminoma and nonseminomatous GCTs (NSGCTs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Men with stage I seminoma have an excellent prognosis following radical inguinal orchiectomy. Therefore, treatment can be tailored to individual patient preferences.</p><p>The treatment approach for men with stage I seminoma is reviewed here.

For patients with stage I seminoma, this procedure is the definitive management and is generally followed by active surveillance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112840\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112840 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23177522\" class=\"local\">'Postsurgical management'</a> below.)</p><p>Classification as stage I seminoma requires:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic diagnosis of pure seminoma (without any evidence of nonseminomatous elements) on final pathologic analysis of the orchiectomy specimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No pretreatment elevation of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases based on staging computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest imaging (radiograph or CT). Patients with evidence of more advanced disease on imaging are classified as having stage II seminoma or advanced germ cell tumor.

Hence, they are classified as &quot;clinical&quot; stage I seminoma using American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) terminology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110731%7EONC%2F110732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 graphicRef110732 \">table 1A-B</a>). Men with findings of lymphadenopathy by imaging (defined as any adenopathy that measures at least 10 mm on the short axis of cross-sectional imaging), and men who undergo a retroperitoneal node dissection for clinical stage I seminoma and are diagnosed with pathologically involved nodes do not have stage I seminoma; instead, they have more advanced disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23177522\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTSURGICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 85 percent of patients with stage I seminoma are cured with orchiectomy. Given the likelihood of cure following orchiectomy, we concur with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and recommend active surveillance rather than adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H77783068\" class=\"local\">'Active surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p>For men who are not willing to comply with follow-up or for those men who desire a more aggressive treatment course, reasonable alternative options to active surveillance include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjuvant single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> (see <a href=\"#H77783389\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) (see <a href=\"#H261198349\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77783068\"><span class=\"h2\">Active surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For men who are willing and able to comply with follow-up, we prefer active surveillance because of the excellent prognosis following surgery. Should these men recur, treatment can be administered with curative intent. Survival following active surveillance is as excellent as that following adjuvant chemotherapy or RT, although these approaches have not been compared in a prospective randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>Active surveillance should be considered a form of postsurgical treatment for men with stage I seminoma. The main benefit of surveillance is the avoidance of unnecessary treatment and the associated treatment-related adverse effects in the 85 percent of patients who will not relapse following orchiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Men contemplating active surveillance should be informed that their chance of survival with this approach is excellent without or with the administration of adjuvant therapy, and risk of death is approximately 0.1 percent. Although there may be concerns about noncompliance, there is no clear impact of noncompliance on survival outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The safety of active surveillance has been consistently demonstrated in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/1,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-10</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, the following outcomes were reported in a cohort of 1954 men with stage I seminoma followed for a median of 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the 369 patients who relapsed (19 percent), the median time to relapse was 14 months. Over 70 percent relapsed during the first two years, and only 7 percent relapsed after year 5.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In almost all patients, relapsed disease was associated with a good prognosis. The disease-specific survival at 15 years was 99.3 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study that included 1344 men with stage I seminoma managed with active surveillance, 173 (13 percent) relapsed at a median of 14 months, but only eight (&lt;1 percent of entire cohort) relapsed beyond three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Only two of the relapses (1 percent) were intermediate risk at relapse. There were no deaths from disease and only one treatment-related death. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a partially overlapping database study of 766 patients managed with active surveillance, the incidence of late relapse (defined as more than two years after orchiectomy) was 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this subset, the pattern of relapse and the subsequent favorable response to treatment were similar to that for early relapse.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23176390\"><span class=\"h3\">Surveillance protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients undergoing active surveillance, serial radiologic imaging is required to ensure early detection of any recurrence. However, the use of serum tumor markers adds little advantage as they are rarely increased in the absence of radiologic evidence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=active-surveillance-following-orchiectomy-for-stage-i-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Active surveillance following orchiectomy for stage I testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77783102\"><span class=\"h4\">CT imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional approach has been to use regular computed tomography (CT) scans, although this is expensive and exposes the patient to radiation and its potential risks. However, less frequent testing may delay the diagnosis of a relapse until more advanced disease is present, thus necessitating more intensive treatment.</p><p>A number of different surveillance recommendations are used or recommended for patients with clinical stage I seminoma. Our practice is consistent with NCCN guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We perform CT scans of the abdomen at 3, 6, and 12 months during the first year, every 6 to 12 months in years 2 and 3, and every 12 to 24 months in years 4 and 5. Chest radiograph is performed with this as clinically indicated, with chest CT considered in symptomatic patients.</p><p>An even less intensive approach to imaging men with clinical stage I seminoma is currently being evaluated by the Medical Research Council (MRC) in the <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00589537&amp;token=YbJELcAW9G3aZfZrjTwgljvGy8B5W5sYbMw5bZWXTZk+ZI7mceh8muPBi3LJy/OL+l+g0wEXZ/bR/ySYFc6RjA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2993\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">TE24 Trial of Imaging and Schedule in Seminoma Testis</a> (TRSST). In this trial, patients are randomly assigned to imaging with either CT (with either three studies over 36 months or seven studies over 60 months) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; using the same two schedules). The study is closed to accrual, but it will be several years until results are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77783127\"><span class=\"h4\">Tumor markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to men with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs), serum tumor markers have very low utility in the follow-up of men with stage I seminoma. Therefore, we do not follow them as part of a surveillance protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This was demonstrated in a study involving 527 men managed by surveillance in one institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At a median of 72 months, relapse occurred in 75 men (14 percent). Only 11 of these men (15 percent) had an elevated marker at the time of relapse. Elevated tumor markers (before the documentation of clinical or radiologic progression) were detected in only one man (1.3 percent). These findings support the guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and suggest not using markers to monitor for relapse in men with stage I seminoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum tumor markers in testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=active-surveillance-following-orchiectomy-for-stage-i-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H900676917\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Active surveillance following orchiectomy for stage I testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Active surveillance protocols'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77783835\"><span class=\"h2\">Men who decline active surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men who choose to undergo adjuvant treatment rather than surveillance should be informed that, while adjuvant therapy reduces their risk of recurrence, it will not improve their chance of survival, which is already excellent following orchiectomy.</p><p>For men who are willing to accept the risks of treatment, adjuvant treatment options include chemotherapy and RT. We prefer chemotherapy because it is associated with less long-term toxicity risks than adjuvant RT. In addition, given their excellent prognosis, single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> is used rather than a multi-agent cisplatin-based regimen. This reduces the risks of treatment-related and long-term complications from chemotherapy even further.</p><p>Semen cryopreservation should be made available to all men diagnosed with testicular cancer prior to instituting therapy if they wish to preserve fertility. For men who decline active surveillance, a baseline semen analysis should be performed, particularly in men who desire to father their own children in the future. At our institution, fertility experts strongly prefer to bank sperm on everyone, but in particular, they recommend it for those men with poor-quality semen analysis.

This led to the evaluation of chemotherapy as an adjuvant option in men with stage I seminoma. Single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, rather than a cisplatin-based combination, has been used because it is associated with less toxicity than cisplatin-based regimens.</p><p>The efficacy of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> was demonstrated in a phase III trial conducted by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In this trial, 1477 men with stage I seminoma were randomly assigned to adjuvant RT or a single course of carboplatin (dosed at an area under the concentration x time curve [AUC] of 7). At a median follow-up of 6.5 years, relapse-free rates were similar with carboplatin and RT (94.7 and 96.0 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There were no deaths due to seminoma.</p><p>Multiple retrospective analyses have looked at the relapse rate with either one or two cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>]. Although the relapse rate may be slightly higher among patients who received only one cycle of carboplatin compared with those who received two cycles, the prognosis was excellent with either approach, and there was no effect on overall survival.</p><p>The prognosis for those patients who do relapse following adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> is generally good and is similar to that for patients who present with higher stage disease. In a retrospective series of 185 men from 31 centers who were treated for relapsed stage I seminoma following one or two cycles of adjuvant carboplatin, the five-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 82 and 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The most common acute side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> are thrombocytopenia, and nausea and vomiting. Late treatment-related toxicities are unlikely with single-agent carboplatin.

Although adjuvant RT is associated with an increased risk of long-term toxicities (eg, an increased risk for second malignancies), contemporary clinical trials have identified meaningful reductions in the size of the treatment field and the dose delivered, which have resulted in a reduction in long-term risks.</p><p>The favorable outcome in patients with clinical stage I seminoma who received adjuvant RT is illustrated by a combined analysis of 1893 patients treated between 1989 and 2001 in one of three randomized phase III trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although relapses were seen in 4 percent of patients, there were only four deaths from seminoma, with the remaining patients successfully treated with chemotherapy administered at the time of recurrence.</p><p>The acute side effects associated with RT include fatigue, gastrointestinal effects, myelosuppression, which is usually mild, skin tanning in the treatment area, and impaired fertility, which is generally not an issue with contemporary RT techniques. Late treatment-related toxicities are discussed separately.

A clamshell shield should be used to protect the remaining testis to reduce the dose of RT it is exposed to.

This approach includes all of the regional lymph nodes of the involved testicle that are at risk for micrometastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. RT to the inguinal orchiectomy scar and ipsilateral scrotal contents is probably unnecessary, even if scrotal violation occurred during surgery.</p><p>Because the paraaortic lymph nodes are the initial nodal group to be involved in the majority of patients who experience tumor spread, paraaortic strip RT protocols were introduced in an effort to decrease treatment-related morbidity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76077\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76077 \">image 2</a>). Using this approach, several centers found overall recurrence and survival rates identical to those obtained with hockey stick or large-field RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. Clinicians who prescribe RT should tailor the RT fields by lowering the superior border from the top of T11 to the top of T12 and by ensuring the RT field is contoured to the ventricles to ensure the heart receives no direct RT. While these are lower than the usually recommended fields, it should be noted that the fields utilized historically were obtained in an era before CT was available for treatment planning. Additionally, support for these borders comes from a survey of 90 patients in which 97 percent of nodal metastases were localized to a smaller area than that which conventionally-targeted RT fields encompass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The MRC Testicular Tumor Working Group TE10 trial randomly assigned 478 men with stage I seminoma to paraaortic strip or paraaortic plus ipsilateral iliac lymph node RT following inguinal orchiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The short-term side effects of RT were decreased, and the incidence of azoospermia was significantly decreased using paraaortic strip RT compared with a more extensive RT field (11 versus 35 percent). With a median follow-up of 4.5 years, there were nine relapses in each group (4 percent). There was only one death due to seminoma in the trial.</p><p>Adjuvant mediastinal RT is not necessary to minimize the risk of relapse, and it leads to an unacceptably high long-term risk of cardiopulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101307368\"><span class=\"h5\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the radiosensitivity of seminoma, a low therapeutic dose is required to effectively treat seminoma, with a recommended dose of 20 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H77783068\" class=\"local\">'Active surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men who want to minimize any risk of relapse and who understand the risk of adverse late effects, we suggest adjuvant treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); we suggest chemotherapy rather than radiation therapy (RT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Our preferred approach is one or two cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H77783389\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men in whom active surveillance is not an option (eg, due to compliance issues) and who refuse chemotherapy, we suggest adjuvant RT (20 Gy in 10 fractions) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If administered, we recommend RT to the paraaortic lymph nodes (a so-called &quot;PA strip&quot;) rather than the older, more extensive &quot;hockey stick&quot; field (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
