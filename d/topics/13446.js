However, it can be a manifestation of serious underlying disease. The challenge for clinicians is to avoid aggressive evaluation and biopsy of most children, while making timely, specific diagnoses in children with serious underlying disease.</p><p>This topic will provide guidelines for our approach to the evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in children. The guidelines are intended to supplement clinical judgment in the absence of research that directly addresses how children with unexplained lymphadenopathy should be evaluated. The causes of peripheral lymphadenopathy in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81033%7EPEDS%2F66847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81033 graphicRef66847 \">table 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71073\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71073 \">table 2</a>), cervical lymphadenitis in children, and peripheral lymphadenitis in adults are discussed separately.

The threshold for enlargement varies with location.

It is not necessary to identify the underlying etiology in every patient, particularly at the time of initial presentation in the primary care setting. The urgency and extent of the evaluation is determined by how ill the patient appears and whether there are clinical features suggestive of malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106127\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106127 \">table 3</a>). The pace of the evaluation is rapid if the child is ill appearing. It can be more deliberate if the child looks well. Sometimes the lymphadenopathy resolves without explanation before invasive diagnostic testing is undertaken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85443541\"><span class=\"h2\">Step-wise approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in children occurs in stages over approximately four weeks:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Early&quot; excisional biopsy refers to biopsy when the child is initially seen at a referral center. Early excisional biopsy is indicated for children with worrisome features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106127\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106127 \">table 3</a>); it also may be indicated for suspected nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection (eg, young child with unilateral, nontender, cervicofacial lymphadenitis with violaceous, thin overlying skin). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontuberculous-mycobacterial-lymphadenitis-in-children#H2272512967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical suspicion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontuberculous-mycobacterial-lymphadenitis-in-children#H2272513047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis in children&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those without worrisome features:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The first stage is to evaluate and treat conditions that appear obvious based upon the history and examination (eg, throat culture for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, heterophile antibodies or specific titers for Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus mononucleosis, serology for <em>Bartonella henselae</em> for cat scratch disease, medical or surgical therapy for NTM).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the cause remains uncertain after the initial evaluation, the second stage is to evaluate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treat common causes of generalized or localized lymphadenopathy (according to site) or to provide a two-week trial of antibiotic therapy or a two- to three-week period of observation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the cause remains uncertain after the second stage evaluation and treatment and the adenopathy has not decreased in size, less common causes and causes that require specific treatment (eg, tuberculosis) are evaluated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If after four weeks of observation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> empiric therapy, the diagnosis remains uncertain and the lymph node has not regressed in size, biopsy may be warranted.</p><p/><p>The evaluation may include blood tests (complete blood count [CBC], erythrocyte sedimentation <span class=\"nowrap\">rate/C-reactive</span> protein <span class=\"nowrap\">[ESR/CRP],</span> serology), cultures, imaging, a trial of antimicrobial therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymph node biopsy. The sequence varies depending upon associated symptoms, whether the lymphadenopathy is generalized or localized, and the site of localized lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"#H26736260\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tests'</a> below.)</p><p>This stepwise approach may avoid unnecessary biopsies. In many patients, the adenopathy will resolve or the cause will become obvious during the evaluation period, with or without therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In a prospective study of biopsy results in 45 children &lt;18 years (mean age 7.8 years) with nonfluctuant peripheral lymphadenopathy, the risk of malignancy increased with increasing age, size of node, number of sites of adenopathy, supraclavicular nodes, fixed nodes, and abnormal radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Factors that were not helpful for discriminating between benign and malignant causes were fever; cough; splenomegaly; skin erythema, discoloration, or induration; tender nodes; or leukocytosis. In a similar study in 123 patients (9 to 25 years of age), the risk of malignancy or granulomatous disease was increased in patients with lymph node size &gt;2 cm (0.8 inches); abnormal chest radiograph; lack of ear, nose, and throat symptoms; and presence of systemic symptoms (eg, night sweats, weight loss, hemoglobin &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9611485\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with <strong>glucocorticoids must be avoided</strong> before a definitive diagnosis is established.

Localized lymphadenopathy (present in only one region) generally suggests local causes and should prompt a search for pathology in the area of node drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71073\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71073 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'General examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, some systemic diseases can present with local adenopathy. These include plague (<em>Yersinia pestis </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52633\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52633 \">picture 4</a>)), tularemia, and aggressive lymphomas. Unilateral localized lymphadenopathy occurs in Hodgkin lymphoma or Rosai-Dorfman disease, whereas bilateral localized lymphadenopathy occurs in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-etiology#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral lymphadenopathy in children: Etiology&quot;, section on 'Uncommon but important causes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Small occipital and postauricular nodes are common in infants but not in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. However, multiple pea-sized occipital nodes are often found in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cervical and inguinal nodes are more common in children &ge;2 years than in those &lt;6 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. Epitrochlear and supraclavicular adenopathy are uncommon at any age, unless there are skin infections or injuries distal to the node.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Generalized adenopathy (present in two or more noncontiguous regions) usually is a manifestation of systemic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81033%7EPEDS%2F66847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81033 graphicRef66847 \">table 1A-B</a>). Palpation of inguinal, cervical, and axillary nodes, in addition to the liver and spleen, can determine whether lymphadenopathy is localized or generalized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Size</strong> &ndash; The size of a lymph node that is considered to be normal varies depending upon the lymph node region and age of the child. In neonates (&lt;1 month of age), normal lymph nodes are &lt;1 cm (0.4 inches) in diameter. In children &ge;1 month, normal lymph nodes in most regions generally are less than 1 cm (0.4 inches) in their longest diameter; normal lymph nodes in the epitrochlear region usually are less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) in diameter, and normal lymph nodes in the inguinal region usually are less than 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) in diameter. Normal lymph nodes tend to be larger in childhood (ages 2 to 10 years) than later in life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of malignancy is increased in lymph nodes &gt;2 cm (0.8 inches) in diameter, although malignancy may occur in smaller nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. In a series of 75 biopsies performed in children 8 months to 17 years, 15 patients had nodes &gt;3 cm (1.2 inches) in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Among these, six patients had reactive hyperplasia, seven had granulomatous disease, and two had lymphomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Consistency</strong> &ndash; The consistency of the node may suggest an etiologic category:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fluctuance usually indicates infection within the node; rapidly developing fluctuance and drainage suggests a bacterial infection, usually <em>S. aureus </em>or GAS; spontaneous drainage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> formation of a fistulous tract that develops over weeks to months suggests mycobacterial infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hard (fibrotic) nodes generally are due to cancer or previous inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Firm, rubbery nodes may indicate lymphoma or chronic leukemia; nodes in acute leukemia tend to be softer.

Abnormal nodes can become fixed to adjacent tissues (eg, deep fascia) by invading cancers or inflammation in tissue surrounding the nodes. They also can become fixed to each other (&quot;matted&quot;) by the same processes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tenderness</strong> &ndash; Tenderness suggests that recent, rapid enlargement has caused tension in the pain receptors in the capsule. Tenderness typically occurs with inflammatory processes, but it also can occur because of hemorrhage into a node, immunologic stimulation, and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnostic-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
