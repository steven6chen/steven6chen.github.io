The entity actually encompasses a spectrum of pathology, ranging from transient minor arrhythmias to severe ventricular injury or pericardial tamponade. Most commonly, the right ventricle is involved, due to its position closest to the anterior chest wall. Nonfatal injury may result in cardiac dysfunction, but rarely results in cardiogenic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-emergency-surgery-after-cardiac-arrest-or-traumatic-cardiac-injury/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac injury from blunt trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Penetrating wounds of the heart often cause tamponade physiology or hemorrhagic shock, depending upon whether blood can escape the pericardial space. Due to the poor compliance of the pericardium, the acute accumulation of as little as 50 mL of blood can cause tamponade. The right ventricle is the most commonly injured chamber in penetrating trauma due to its anterior position within the chest cavity. The next most common is the left ventricle. Atrial injuries are less common and generally less severe, while multi-chamber injuries cause higher mortality.

The ECG may show repolarization abnormalities, such as ST-depression or elevation and T-wave inversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-emergency-surgery-after-cardiac-arrest-or-traumatic-cardiac-injury/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Arrhythmias include sinus tachycardia, extrasystoles, right bundle branch block, and atrioventricular block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-emergency-surgery-after-cardiac-arrest-or-traumatic-cardiac-injury/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>]. Commotio cordis, in which low-impact chest trauma causes sudden cardiac arrest, is rare and may be due to the timing of the blow during a period of electrical susceptibility. Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation is also rare, but life-threatening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac injury from blunt trauma&quot;, section on 'Arrhythmia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=commotio-cordis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Commotio cordis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After penetrating cardiac injury, pericardial tamponade is a significant risk. If the rate of bleeding is slow, or the pericardium periodically decompresses by emptying blood into the pleural space, patients may have only subtle symptoms such as shortness of breath. However, tamponade physiology ultimately causes diminished cardiac output, leading to a decrease in systolic blood pressure and a narrowing of the pulse pressure. Diagnosis should be determined rapidly by echocardiography if equipment and expertise are available.
