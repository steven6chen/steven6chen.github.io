The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that LTBI treatment be included as part of the TB control program for high income or upper middle income countries with an estimated TB incidence rate of less than 100 per 100,000 population per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In most individuals, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> infection is contained initially by host defenses, and the infection remains in a prolonged, suppressed state termed &quot;latency&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, latent infection has the potential to develop into active infection (termed &quot;active disease&quot;) at any time. Identification and treatment of LTBI greatly reduces the likelihood of reactivation and so has potential to protect the health of the individuals as well as the public by reducing the number of potential sources of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Following LTBI treatment, the durability of protection against reactivation is variable and depends upon regional prevalence of TB and risk for reexposure. LTBI treatment may confer lifelong protection against disease; among Alaskan Eskimos, for example, the protective effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> prophylaxis has been shown to persist for more than 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Treatment of LTBI should be initiated only once active TB has been excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The approach to treatment of LTBI in HIV-uninfected patients will be reviewed here. LTBI in children and diagnostic testing for LTBI in HIV-uninfected patients are discussed in detail separately, as is management of LTBI for patients with HIV or receiving tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors.

Only those who would benefit from treatment should be tested, so a decision to test presupposes a decision to treat if the test is positive.</p><p>Patients with a positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> or interferon-gamma release assay should undergo medical evaluation to exclude active TB, including a chest radiograph. The decision to initiate LTBI therapy should be made by someone who is familiar with the risks and benefits of LTBI therapy, including the advantages and disadvantages of different regimens. LTBI treatment should be initiated only for patients in the categories for which treatment confers benefit. Those who have undergone testing who fall outside these categories should not receive LTBI therapy, as risk outweighs potential benefit.</p><p>These issues are discussed further separately.

However, because not all patients complete the course of therapy, the efficacy of treatment is only about 60 percent (range 25 to 92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>In the only study comparing the efficacy of different durations of INH therapy, six months of treatment was 65 percent effective and 12 months of treatment was 75 percent effective (but not statistically different from six months) in preventing TB among patients with radiographic abnormalities suggestive of inactive infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By extrapolation of data from randomized trials, the optimal duration of INH treatment for LTBI has been determined to be nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/3,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,17</a>].</p><p>The most important side effect of INH is hepatitis; the incidence is about 1 per 1000 persons, although asymptomatic, mild liver enzyme abnormalities are relatively common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The most important risk factor for the development of INH-induced hepatitis is alcohol consumption; patients should be advised to abstain from alcohol while taking INH. In addition, all individuals on INH should be educated about the symptoms of hepatitis and instructed to seek prompt evaluation of symptoms to reduce risk for progression to severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 2 percent of patients taking INH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It is caused by interference with metabolism of pyridoxine and can be prevented with pyridoxine supplementation (25 to 50 mg daily). This is especially important for patients with conditions that can predispose to neuropathy (including diabetes, uremia, alcoholism, malnutrition, and HIV infection) as well as in the setting of pregnancy and seizure disorders. Pyridoxine should also be administered to infants of breastfeeding mothers receiving INH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H247273937\"><span class=\"h2\">Rifampin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> for reducing the incidence of active TB is estimated to be similar to that of INH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

A three-month regimen of weekly INH and RPT given as directly observed therapy (DOT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65944 \">table 1</a>) has been shown to be noninferior to a nine-month self-administered regimen of daily INH in a randomized, open-label trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The trial included 7731 predominantly HIV-uninfected individuals at high risk for progression from latent to active TB infection in four low-incidence countries (Brazil, Canada, Spain, and the United States) for up to 33 months of follow-up. Patients were required to be &ge;12 years of age and belong to one of the following four high-risk categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close contact of patient with culture-confirmed contagious TB and positive tuberculin test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversion from negative to positive tuberculin test result</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected patients not on antiretroviral medications with positive tuberculin test or who have had close contact with known TB case (regardless of tuberculin test status)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive tuberculin test with fibrotic changes on chest radiograph consistent with previously untreated TB</p><p/><p>Most participants in the trial were presumed to be recently infected; infected contacts of infectious cases and recent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> converters made up approximately 96 percent of patients. TB developed in 7 of 3986 patients in the combination therapy group (cumulative rate 0.19 percent) and 15 of 3745 patients in the INH-only group (cumulative rate 0.43 percent). Hepatoxicity was observed more frequently in the INH group than the combination therapy group (2.7 versus 0.4 percent; p&lt;0.001), while &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; was observed more frequently in the combination therapy group than the INH group (3.8 versus 0.5 percent; p&lt;0.001).</p><p>The completion rate was 82 percent for the combination therapy group and 69 percent for INH (p&lt;0.01). At least some of the higher completion rate for combination therapy (and thus, some of the efficacy) can be attributed to administration of combination therapy via DOT, while INH was administered without DOT.</p><p>The trial also observed an association between weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifapentine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifapentine</a> and flu-like syndrome or other systemic drug reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These reactions occurred in 3.5 percent of 3893 mostly HIV-uninfected patients; risk factors included white ethnicity, older age, and lower body mass index. The reactions were serious (hypotension or syncope) in 0.3 percent of cases; none was associated with serious sequelae or death. This phenomenon remains poorly understood and difficult to predict; therefore, careful monitoring of patients on this regimen is important.</p><p>Implementation of a three-month regimen of weekly INH and RPT with DOT in 16 healthcare settings throughout the United States was associated with treatment completion rate of 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Such implementation in New York City Health Department clinics (302 patients) was also associated with a significant increase in treatment completion (65 versus 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Administration of weekly INH and RPT via DOT is preferable to review for side effects and to withhold treatment if significant side effects are suspected.

Important side effects include symptoms of &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; (eg, light headedness, dizziness, headache, nausea or vomiting, syncope, rash, or angioedema) experienced following ingestion of the previous dose. This approach is based on a study including 774 patients with LTBI in the United States treated with INH and RPT given once weekly for 12 weeks via DOT, self-administration, or self-administration with reminders; completion rates were 85, 78, and 77 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
