While stress testing can be performed in a variety of ways, the most commonly used and widely available stress testing modalities are exercise electrocardiography (ECG; non-imaging) and exercise or pharmacologic stress combined with imaging (stress echocardiography or stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging [MPI]). </p><p>The choice of stress testing modality depends on many factors, including but not limited to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to perform adequate exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting ECG findings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical indication for performing the test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient's body habitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of prior coronary revascularization</p><p/><p>While exercise ECG testing is generally recommended for patients who are able to exercise, the ability to accurately identify ischemic ECG changes during exercise requires the absence of baseline ECG abnormalities that could interfere with interpretation of the test. Two such abnormalities are complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) and a paced ventricular rhythm, which are also associated with a high rate of false positive or uninterpretable tests in patients undergoing exercise stress. The 2002 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines on exercise testing concluded that there is no level of ST segment depression that confers diagnostic significance during exercise ECG testing in patients with LBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Because of the lack of diagnostic ECG information in patients with LBBB or paced ventricular rhythm, stress testing in these patients requires an imaging modality. </p><p>The approach to stress testing in patients with LBBB or paced ventricular rhythm will be presented here. The approach to stress testing in patients without LBBB is discussed in detail separately.

In some patients with known CHD and prior coronary revascularization or a change in clinical status, stress testing is indicated for the diagnosis of new or progressive disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for risk stratification. In addition to symptomatic patients with known or suspected CHD, patients with heart failure, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, or planned non-cardiac surgery may be candidates for stress testing. A full discussion of the indications for stress testing is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test#H458218799\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test&quot;, section on 'Indications for stress testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI) and stress echocardiography both have significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than exercise electrocardiography (ECG) without imaging and should be used for patients with baseline LBBB who require a stress test for the diagnosis of known or suspected CHD, as well as for management of risk stratification in known CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In symptomatic patients with LBBB, both imaging tests are considered appropriate for detection and risk assessment of CHD by the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACCF/AHA/ASE/ASNC/HFSA/HRS/SCAI/SCCT/SCMR/STS</span> 2013 Multimodality Appropriate Use Criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A variety of stress testing modalities have been evaluated in patients with LBBB. Studies have shown that exercise-induced ST segment depression is common in the presence of LBBB and has no association with ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In a study of 31 asymptomatic men with LBBB on their baseline ECG, the majority of patients exhibited ST segment change. All subjects underwent invasive coronary angiography, and only five were found to have significant CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Based on these and other data, ST-segment responses cannot be used to make diagnostic decisions on patients with LBBB, and the exercise ECG alone is always considered to be nondiagnostic for CHD in the setting of LBBB. Additionally, no prognostic data are available on exercise ECG in patients with LBBB. For these reasons, <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> Guidelines do not recommend using exercise ECG alone for diagnosis of CHD in patients with LBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress rMPI in LBBB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of a higher specificity for the diagnosis of CHD in patients with LBBB, we recommend vasodilator stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI) rather than exercise rMPI. This is true even for patients who can exercise and who would otherwise be candidates for exercise stress testing. The choice of vasodilator (dipyridamole, adenosine, or regadenoson) will depend upon local availability and expertise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2849502738\"><span class=\"h3\">Proposed mechanisms of false positive exercise rMPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise rMPI in the setting of resting LBBB has lower specificity and positive predictive value compared with vasodilator stress rMPI. Compared with vasodilator rMPI, exercise rMPI has a higher rate of <strong>false-positive</strong> reversible septal perfusion defects in the absence of an obstructive lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The mechanism of false-positive septal perfusion defects during exercise rMPI in patients with LBBB is not completely understood, but several hypotheses have been proposed. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Septal contraction is delayed and occurs at the end of systole, leading to abnormal septal post-systolic motion and delayed ventricular relaxation, which then results in compression of the septal perforators, impairment of diastolic coronary blood flow, and septal hypoperfusion. This becomes more prominent with tachycardia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impairment in diastolic coronary blood flow may lead to reduced septal endothelial function and reduced coronary flow reserve, resulting in microvascular dysfunction, again manifesting as septal hypoperfusion, and also worsened by tachycardia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The septum contracts late in systole at a time when the remaining walls of the left ventricle have already completed their contraction. When the septum contracts against less outflow resistance, septal perfusion is reduced due to coronary autoregulation. With exercise induced tachycardia and a shortened diastole, the septal hypoperfusion becomes more apparent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2542937701\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasodilator stress rMPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasodilator stress rMPI, using dipyridamole, adenosine, or regadenoson, should be used rather than exercise rMPI for patients with LBBB. </p><p>Unlike exercise stress, vasodilator stress agents do not rely on achieving a pre-specified maximal heart rate but instead produce coronary vasodilation, thereby increasing coronary blood flow up to four to five times above baseline levels in normal coronary arteries and producing relative hypoperfusion distal to any flow-limiting coronary stenosis. Two commonly used vasodilator stress agents in rMPI, dipyridamole and adenosine, generally will increase the heart rate by only 10 to 20 percent as compared with baseline measurements. As a result of the lower stress heart rate with these two vasodilator stress agents, the incidence of false-positive results with vasodilator stress rMPI appears to be lower than that of exercise rMPI. Vasodilator stress is, therefore, more specific for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease than exercise rMPI. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>].</p><p>Although randomized studies have not been performed, a meta-analysis of published studies using either dipyridamole or adenosine vasodilator stress with rMPI in the setting of LBBB reported a specificity of approximately 80 percent for the detection of angiographic disease in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, significantly higher than the specificity of 47 percent for exercise rMPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Unlike specificity in rMPI, sensitivity was high for both exercise (92.9 percent) and pharmacological stress (88.5 percent) in the presence of LBBB. The higher specificity of vasodilator stress rMPI compared with exercise rMPI in LBBB has resulted in the recommendation to perform vasodilator stress with either dipyridamole or adenosine with rMPI, rather than performing exercise rMPI, even if the patient is able to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>].</p><p>Regadenoson, a more selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist with fewer side effects than dipyridamole or adenosine, is available for use in some countries, including the United States. Based on limited data, regadenoson has been recommended by the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) for use in patients with LBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Regadenoson can be given as a bolus injection rather than an infusion as required by the older agents. Regadenoson generally increases the stress heart rate by as much as 40 percent compared with baseline, which has raised concerns regarding its use in LBBB. In a single study published in 2013, in which 64 patients with LBBB underwent regadenoson (47 patients) and adenosine (17 patients) stress rMPI, respectively, the relative increase in heart rate during vasodilator stress was significantly higher in the regadenoson group (37.8 percent) compared with the adenosine group (23.2 percent), but there was no increase in septal or LAD perfusion defects or in total perfusion by quantitative analysis with regadenoson as compared with adenosine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Adding low-level exercise to vasodilator stress rMPI has been shown to decrease side effects and improve image quality. However, given the greater increase in heart rate with the addition of exercise to any vasodilator stress and the potential to increase false-positive results in LBBB, concomitant low-level exercise in patients with LBBB is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging#H88557511\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging&quot;, section on 'Combined exercise and vasodilator stress'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355460592\"><span class=\"h3\">Dobutamine stress rMPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 2016 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) imaging guideline for rMPI, LBBB is listed as a relative contraindication to the use of dobutamine stress rMPI; this relates to safety concerns (ie, inability to monitor for ischemia at higher heart rates with dobutamine) as well as concerns regarding diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, in a study of 383 patients with LBBB who underwent stress rMPI (exercise in 206, adenosine in 127, and dobutamine in 50 patients) and coronary angiography (154 patients), the false positive rate for septal perfusion defects was 46 percent during exercise, 11 percent with adenosine, and 8 percent with dobutamine (non-significant difference compared to adenosine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The study reported no major adverse effects in the dobutamine group. Based on these data and clinical experience, we feel that dobutamine can be used safely, and may be preferred over exercise stress testing, in patients with LBBB undergoing rMPI who have contraindications to vasodilator stress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging#H88555859\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of a higher diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of CHD, stress echocardiography is also preferred over exercise ECG testing in patients with LBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. Moreover, as an added benefit, other non-ischemic cardiac conditions associated with LBBB, including valvular heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, can be readily recognized during baseline imaging. &#160;</p><p>The diagnostic accuracy of stress echocardiography in patients with LBBB, using exercise or dobutamine-atropine, has been examined in small series of patients. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 35 patients with LBBB and suspected CHD, in which all patients underwent exercise echocardiography (without an echocardiographic contrast agent) and coronary angiography, exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities had an overall sensitivity of 76 percent, specificity of 83 percent, and accuracy of 84 percent for the diagnosis of obstructive CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 64 patients with LBBB and suspected CHD who underwent dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography (without an echocardiographic contrast agent) and coronary angiography, stress-induced new or worsening wall motion abnormalities had a sensitivity of 68 percent, specificity of 91 percent, and diagnostic accuracy 84 percent for diagnosis of obstructive CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p>Importantly, these studies included patients with limited exercise capacity and limited acoustic windows and did not use contrast echocardiography to optimize imaging, both of which could have led to an underestimate of the diagnostic accuracy of the test.</p><p>Stress echocardiography (exercise echocardiography, and pharmacologic dobutamine stress echocardiography [DSE] or dipyridamole) provides important prognostic information in patients with known or suspected CHD who had LBBB at rest. Patients undergoing stress echocardiography (exercise or pharmacologic) who had stress inducible wall motion abnormalities (ie, myocardial ischemia) had significantly greater mortality and more adverse cardiac outcomes compared with patients without inducible ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Importantly, stress echocardiographic results provided incremental value over clinical, resting echocardiographic, and treadmill exercise data for the prediction of mortality and major cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A more in-depth discussion of the role of stress echocardiography in determining prognosis in patients with CHD is presented separately.

While pharmacologic stress CMR can be useful and is considered &quot;appropriate&quot; for patients with intermediate to high pretest probability of CHD and LBBB, this test is only available in a limited number of centers who have expertise in performing and interpreting the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>There are limited data on stress CMR in patients with LBBB, although in one study that compared dobutamine stress CMR (with assessment of both first-pass perfusion and late gadolinium enhancement) with contrast-enhanced DSE in 82 patients who also underwent invasive coronary angiography, there was similar sensitivity (72 percent), with a higher specificity and diagnostic accuracy for dobutamine stress CMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. While there are limited data on the utility of stress CMR in patients with LBBB, this stress imaging modality has excellent spatial resolution and can incorporate assessment of stress wall motion, first-pass perfusion, and late gadolinium enhancement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PACED VENTRICULAR RHYTHM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of stress testing modalities have been evaluated in patients with a paced ventricular rhythm. Exercise ECG without imaging is not recommended in patients with right ventricular pacing, given the inability to detect ischemic ECG changes on the exercise ECG in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As such, stress testing in patients with a paced ventricular rhythm should incorporate imaging (eg, stress rMPI or stress echocardiography)<strong> </strong>to improve the diagnostic capacity of the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Stress CMR has not been evaluated in patients with a pacemaker due to limitations on performing magnetic resonance imaging in patients with a metallic pacemaker in situ.</p><p>Most patients with a paced ventricular rhythm are paced via a transvenous right ventricular (RV) endocardial lead; such pacing generally produces the appearance of LBBB on the ECG. Like LBBB, RV pacing during exercise rMPI is associated with false positive reversible perfusion defects in the absence of an obstructive coronary artery lesion. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. The postulated mechanisms are similar to those of false-positive perfusion defects in LBBB. (See <a href=\"#H2542937701\" class=\"local\">'Vasodilator stress rMPI'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with right ventricular pacing, the inferior, inferoseptal, and apical walls are the most common sites of false positive perfusion defects during exercise rMPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. The false positive perfusion defects associated with a paced ventricular rhythm may result from delayed and asynchronous activation of the left ventricle, although impaired microvascular flow may also contribute to these defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Adenosine or dipyridamole rMPI is recommended by professional society guidelines for the diagnosis of suspected CHD in patients with a paced ventricular rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, data are very limited on the diagnostic performance of rMPI in patients with a right ventricular paced rhythm. In a single study comparing adenosine and regadenoson rMPI in patients with right ventricular paced rhythm, there was no significant difference in ischemia between the two agents, suggesting that regadenoson is an acceptable vasodilator stress agent in this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Adenosine or dipyridamole rMPI is also recommended by the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines for the risk stratification of known or suspected CHD in patients with a paced ventricular rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Data regarding prognostic testing in this setting are even more limited than data regarding diagnosis. In one study of 108 patients with single or dual chamber pacemakers, exercise rMPI was able discriminate between those at low and high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At five years, patients with high-risk scans had a significantly higher rate of cardiac death or myocardial infarction than those with low-risk scans (19 versus 7 percent). There are no published prognostic data on the use of regadenoson in this population.</p><p>As with LBBB, exercise or dobutamine stress echocardiography may be used to detect ischemia in patients with a paced ventricular rhythm. If the heart rate does not increase with dobutamine and atropine in a patient with a permanent pacemaker, stress echocardiography can be achieved by increasing the pacing rate until the target heart rate is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-patients-with-left-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-ventricular-rhythm/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443079\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the inability to adequately detect ischemic electrocardiography ECG changes in the setting of a baseline left bundle branch block (LBBB) or paced ventricular rhythm, exercise ECG alone is nondiagnostic for coronary heart disease (CHD).
