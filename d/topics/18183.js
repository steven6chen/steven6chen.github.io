TSC is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait in one-third of cases while nonfamilial cases represent either spontaneous mutations or mosaicism.

It can occur sporadically (sporadic-LAM) or in association with TSC (TSC-LAM). Many clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features are shared between TSC and sporadic variants.
