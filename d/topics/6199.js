approximately 230,000 per year in the 1980s, the incidence has fluctuated more recently and remains high. In 2015, there were an estimated 33,900 new HCV infections, representing a 2.9-fold increase since 2010 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116122\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116122 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This estimate was adjusted for case ascertainment and under-reporting, although may still underestimate the actual incidence of acute HCV infection given the difficulties in diagnosis and narrow national case definitions. </p><p>Specifically, HCV infection rates have increased substantially among young adults over the past decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In one surveillance study, the incidence of acute HCV infection in young adults rose faster in nonurban than urban counties, and the majority of infected individuals were white (85 percent) with an even gender distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These trends likely reflect the epidemic of opioid and injection drug use in the United States. The number of cases of transfusion-associated acute HCV infection decreased significantly after 1985 and has been reduced almost to zero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, transfusion-associated hepatitis has had little impact on the recent change in the incidence of HCV infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54694%7EGAST%2F53650\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54694 graphicRef53650 \">figure 3A-B</a>). </p><p>The prevalence of chronic HCV infection in the United States has been estimated by analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), in which participants, chosen according to an algorithm to produce a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized population of the United States, are tested for antibodies to HCV and viral RNA if positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Between 2003 and 2010, the estimated prevalence of antibodies to HCV was 1.3 percent (reflecting an approximate 3.6 million people with past or current HCV infection), and the estimated prevalence of HCV RNA positivity was 1 percent (reflecting an approximate 2.7 million people with chronic HCV infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The peak prevalence was observed among individuals born between 1945 and 1965, although subsequent studies have suggested that the prevalence in younger individuals may be surpassing that [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2080842940\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics associated with infection'</a> below.) </p><p>One major limitation of the using the NHANES data to extrapolate HCV prevalence is that they do not include individuals who are homeless or incarcerated and thus underestimate the overall prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Based on other surveys, it is estimated that 16 to 41 percent of adult prison inmates have serologic evidence of HCV infection, and that 12 to 35 percent are chronically infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2080842940\"><span class=\"h3\">Characteristics associated with infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to analysis of NHANES 2010 results, characteristics most strongly associated with chronic HCV infection were birth between 1945 and 1965 and a history of illicit drug use other than marijuana (including injection drug use) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Overall, approximately 80 percent of patients with chronic HCV in the United States were born between 1945 and 1965; the prevalence of HCV among this group was 2.6 percent, which is sixfold the prevalence among all other adults. This observation is the rationale for the recommendation by the CDC and the US Preventive Services Task Force to routinely screen all patients in this baby boomer birth cohort for HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H20869930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on '1945 to 1965 birth cohort'</a>.)</p><p>Otherwise, injection drug use remains the most important risk factor for HCV acquisition. As an example, the increasing incidence of HCV infections among young individuals in various urban, suburban, and rural settings in the United States has mirrored the epidemic of injection prescription opioid and subsequently heroin use in these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Injection drug use'</a> below.)</p><p>Other characteristics associated with chronic HCV infection include male gender, non-Hispanic black race, low family income, high-school education or less, and a history of at least 10 lifetime sexual partners. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2080842946\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical consequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of acute HCV infection are anicteric and asymptomatic, with fewer than 25 percent being clinically apparent. Fulminant hepatitis C is rare. Of those who go on to have chronic infection, a substantial proportion will develop cirrhosis, and a subset of those develop hepatocellular carcinoma. These are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2080843164\"><span class=\"h3\">Costs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The annual costs related to HCV infection in the United States were estimated in a study that aggregated data from multiple data sets collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, the Health Care Financing Administration, and other government bureaus and private firms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In 1997, the cost of HCV was approximately $5.46 billion, the bulk of which (92 percent) was due to chronic liver disease; the remaining costs were related to hepatocellular carcinoma. This figure is similar to the annual costs of asthma. The estimate was considered to be conservative since it did not include costs related to pain and suffering and the value of care provided by family members.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients infected with HCV in the United States and Europe acquired the disease through intravenous drug use or blood transfusion, the latter of which has become rare since routine testing of the blood supply for HCV was begun in 1990 (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Blood transfusion'</a> below). Other types of parenteral exposure are important in specific regions in the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>No identifiable risk factors for HCV infection during the previous six months can be identified in up to 44 percent of cases with new infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This rate is similar to that seen with acute hepatitis A or B infection. However, after careful questioning, most of these patients give a past history of high-risk behavior (such as injection drug use), and many are from low socioeconomic strata, which is known to be associated with a greater risk of hepatitis. Some of these risk factors were elucidated in a case control study from the United States involving 2316 HCV positive blood donors in whom the following HCV risk factors were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous drug use &ndash; odds ratio 49.6</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood transfusion &ndash; odds ratio 10.9</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex with an intravenous drug user &ndash; odds ratio 6.3</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having been in jail more than three days &ndash; odds ratio 2.9</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Religious scarification &ndash; odds ratio 2.8</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having been struck or cut with a bloody object &ndash; odds ratio 2.1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pierced ears or body parts &ndash; odds ratio 2.0</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin injection &ndash; odds ratio 1.6</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Injection drug use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral exposure to the hepatitis C virus is the most efficient means of transmission. Thus, it is not surprising that injection drug use with shared needles or other paraphernalia has been the most common identifiable source of acute HCV infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74500\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74500 \">figure 4</a>). Worldwide, 25 countries have reported that 60 to 80 percent of injection drug users have reactive anti-HCV antibody; in 12 countries, the prevalence is over 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The efficiency of transmission via this route is evidenced by the high rate of anti-HCV antibodies observed in short-term injectors and outbreaks of HCV among injection drug users. As an example, in a systematic review, the mean prevalence of anti-HCV reactivity after one year of injection drug use was 32 percent in resource-rich settings and 59 percent in resource-limited settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The prevalence estimated from studies in resource-rich settings prior to 1995 was higher and more comparable to that from resource-limited settings, and the subsequent decrease could reflect public health efforts to stem transmission. Without preventive measures, widespread transmission of HCV can occur rapidly within injection drug communities, as reflected by a highly publicized outbreak of HIV and HCV among over 100 prescription opioid injectors in a small rural county in the midwestern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>HCV infection also has been associated with a history of intranasal cocaine use, presumably due to blood on shared straws [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood transfusion was a major risk factor for acute infection in the past, with more than 10 percent of transfusion recipients acquiring infection in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The screening of blood donors for historical risk factors, serologic evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg and anti-HBc), and elevated serum ALT caused a striking reduction in the rates of non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis, even before HCV was identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53650\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53650 \">figure 3B</a>). The subsequent initiation of donor screening for anti-HCV antibodies in 1990 has nearly eliminated the risk of post-transfusion acute HCV infection. The estimated risk is now less than one in a million per unit transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In the spring of 1999, another blood donor HCV testing technology, nucleic acid testing (NAT), was introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is anticipated that this technology, which detects HCV genetic material rather than later-appearing antibodies, will further decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted HCV by 5- to 10-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. This continuing decline in risk of post-transfusion HCV explains the observation that a history of blood product transfusion is much more common in patients presenting with chronic HCV (remote infection) than with acute infection.</p><p>Multiply transfused patients, including those with thalassemia or hemophilia, have been at particularly high risk of developing hepatitis C. The prevalence of anti-HCV in hemophiliacs who regularly received concentrates of clotting factors before adequate procedures were used to inactivate viruses (eg, heat inactivation or pasteurization) was 84 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Since the use of treated or recombinant clotting factors has become routine, new cases of hepatitis C infection have become uncommon in these patients. The continued high prevalence of anti-HCV in this population is due to past exposure to untreated concentrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Health care workers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues related to HCV in health care workers are presented separately.

A study from Spain suggested that hospitalization itself was an important cause of acute HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Hospitalization was believed to account for 73 of 109 cases (67 percent) of acute HCV cases documented in 18 Spanish hospitals, which accounted for more cases than intravenous drug use (8 percent), needle stick injury (6 percent), and sexual contact (5 percent). Of these patients, 33 had undergone surgery, 24 were admitted to a medical emergency unit or ward, and the remaining had undergone diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. In another study from Spain, hospitalization for longer than 10 days in a liver unit was associated with an increased risk of HCV transmission from infected patients (typically roommates) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In the United States, where there are stringent infection control protocols to prevent transmission, particularly through unsafe medication injection practices, nosocomial transmission has still been reported, generally because of breaches in protocol. Rare sources of transmission of HCV include contaminated equipment used during the performance of procedures and other breakdowns of infection control procedures or aseptic techniques leading to person-to-person transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/33-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-41</a>].

Another outbreak of six cases of HCV (along with six cases of hepatitis B) was linked to the inappropriate reuse of syringes and single-patient-use vials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> by a single anesthesiologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Other cases of nosocomial transmission or outbreaks are associated with health care personnel tampering with (diverting, self-injecting, and substituting) injectable opioids intended for medical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Organ transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transplant recipients who receive organs from HCV-positive donors have a high risk of acquiring HCV infection and liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Some studies have shown nearly universal transmission; in one report, 75 percent of the 29 recipients of organs (19 kidneys, 6 hearts, 4 livers) from 13 anti-HCV positive donors became anti-HCV or HCV-RNA positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The seroprevalence of anti-HCV is increased among heterosexuals with many partners and men who have sex with men (MSM), groups which serve as an epidemiologic barometer of sexual transmission risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. The risk of transmission from index cases who are not infected with HIV appears to be similar among heterosexual and homosexual partners. Among MSM, rectal shedding of HCV in infected individuals has been reported and certain sexual practices may carry a higher risk of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/52,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,55,56</a>]. In a study of 5310 MSM followed for a median of seven years, unprotected receptive anal sex with more than one partner was independently associated with incident HCV infection among both HIV-infected and uninfected participants, whereas unprotected insertive anal sex with multiple partners was not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>The risk of transmission of HCV infection between monogamous sexual partners has been difficult to demonstrate in prospective studies. One of the largest studies to examine rates of transmission in detail (reported in preliminary form) focused on 500 monogamous, heterosexual couples who had had sexual contact for a median of 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Only 17 percent reported regular or frequent use of condoms. A total of 20 partners (4 percent) had HCV antibodies. However, 40 percent of these patients had discordant <span class=\"nowrap\">genotypes/serotypes</span> suggesting that they had acquired HCV through other routes of transmission. In addition, of those with concordant genotypes, phylogenetic evaluation found that the viral isolates from both members of the couple were highly related in three of the couples (0.6 percent of the total population studied), consistent with transmission of the virus within the couple. The overall incidence of HCV transmission by sex was estimated to be 0.07 percent per year.</p><p>Another large, prospective study included 895 monogamous, heterosexual partners of HCV infected individuals who were followed for 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The average weekly rate of sexual intercourse was 1.8. All couples denied practicing anal intercourse, having sex during menstruation, or use of condoms. During follow-up, three patients developed HCV infection; however, molecular analysis showed that none had acquired it from their spouse.</p><p>Other, retrospective studies estimate the likelihood of transmission under these circumstances to be approximately 0.1 percent annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A potential mechanism of nonsexual transmission in these instances is mucosal exposure to infectious blood or to body fluids containing blood, or unapparent percutaneous exposure through personal hygiene items (eg, shared razors or toothbrushes). In many situations, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that transmission resulted from common exposure to risk factors other than sexual exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The risk of sexual transmission may be higher if the index case is coinfected with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In one report, for example, the anti-HCV prevalence in stable heterosexual partners of <span class=\"nowrap\">HCV-positive/HIV-positive</span> index cases was 2.2 times higher than in stable heterosexual partners of index cases reactive for anti-HCV only (9.2 versus 4.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Other factors associated with anti-HCV positivity included greater numbers of sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted diseases, and failure to use a condom.

It is likely that the use of condoms will lower the risk of sexual transmission further, similar to the case with hepatitis B virus and HIV. However, the United States Public Health Service and a consensus statement issued by the National Institutes of Health have not recommended barrier precautions between stable monogamous sexual partners.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Perinatal transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perinatal transmission of HCV occurs at the time of birth in about 5 percent of infants born to anti-HCV positive women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Although the incidence of HCV infection has been declining among dialysis patients, the relatively high incidence of anti-HCV seropositivity in this population remains a concern and intermittent outbreaks in dialysis units continue to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. A number of risk factors have been identified for HCV infection among dialysis patients, including blood transfusions, the duration of end-stage renal disease (and dialysis), the type of dialysis (risk is highest with in-hospital hemodialysis and lowest with peritoneal dialysis), and the prevalence of HCV infection in the dialysis unit. HCV infection among patients on dialysis is discussed in detail elsewhere.
