This gland makes thyroid hormone, which controls how the body uses and stores energy.</p><p>If you have thyroiditis, your thyroid gland leaks large amounts of thyroid hormone into your bloodstream. This causes a condition called <strong>hyper</strong>thyroidism. That is the medical term for too much thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism lasts only until the thyroid hormone stored in your gland is used up.</p><p>After that happens, you might not have enough thyroid hormone in your bloodstream. This causes a condition called <strong>hypo</strong>thyroidism. That is the medical term for too little thyroid hormone. But once the inflammation goes away and you thyroid gland heals, it will start to make thyroid hormone again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100339892\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes thyroiditis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many different things can cause thyroiditis, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system.&quot; If your immune system attacks healthy cells, including cells in your thyroid, it is called an &quot;autoimmune response.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines or radiation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100339909\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of thyroiditis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some types of thyroiditis cause the thyroid gland to swell. Sometimes, this can also cause pain in the neck that can spread to the jaw and ears.</p><p>Most people with thyroiditis first have symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak or tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight, even when eating normally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a fast or uneven heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating a lot and having trouble dealing with hot weather</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling worried</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trembling</p><p/><p>The symptoms of hyperthyroidism might last for up to 6 to 8 weeks. Then, people with thyroiditis might have symptoms of hypothyroidism, which can last for 2 to 8 weeks. Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having no energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling cold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble having bowel movements (constipation)</p><p/><p>In most people with thyroiditis, thyroid hormone levels return to normal within 6 to 8 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100339924\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for thyroiditis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. You will need blood tests, called thyroid function tests.</p><p>Your doctor might also order other tests. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid scan - For this test, you get a pill or shot with a small amount of a radioactive substance. Then a special camera takes pictures of your thyroid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid ultrasound &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the thyroid.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100339939\"><span class=\"h1\">How is thyroiditis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on your symptoms and what caused your thyroiditis.
