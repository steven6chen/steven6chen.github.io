Because of its abrupt onset and termination, AVNRT is categorized as a paroxysmal SVT (PSVT). As with the majority of SVTs, the QRS complex in AVNRT is usually narrow (ie, &le;120 msec), reflecting normal ventricular activation through the His-Purkinje system, although aberrant conduction (eg, underlying bundle branch block) can result in a wide QRS complex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H1477567181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Paroxysmal SVT'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the mechanisms, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and the management of AVNRT. A detailed discussion of the broader approach to narrow QRS complex tachycardias is presented separately.

AVNRT can present at any age, but as with AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) that involves an accessory pathway, it is more likely to begin in young adults. In a series of 231 patients with AVNRT, the mean age of symptom onset was 32 years, with two-thirds of cases beginning after the age of 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517939555\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic substrate for AVNRT involves dual electrical pathways in or near the AV node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53347 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The arrhythmia usually develops in hearts that are otherwise normal, although it can also occur in the presence of underlying structural heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A more detailed discussion of the electrophysiology of AVNRT can be found in published reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/5,6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,9,10</a>].

Koch's triangle is bounded by the tricuspid ring and the tendon of Todoro, which bracket the coronary sinus at the base of the triangle and are in close proximity forming the apex near the His bundle at the membranous septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69647\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69647 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52196\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52196 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>].

This model is supported by clinical observations as well as animal and human mapping studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>]. These pathways may be distinct anatomic structures, or they may be functionally separate (ie, regions that appear anatomically continuous but have different electrical properties). It is possible that some cases of AVNRT are acquired when there is right atrial pressure overload leading to changes in the electrophysiologic properties of the AV nodal inputs. Rare cases of familial AVNRT have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Whether the dual pathways are anatomic or functional, in order for reentry to occur, they must have different conduction velocities and refractory periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One pathway conducts rapidly and has a relatively long refractory period. This is called the <strong>fast pathway</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second pathway conducts relatively slowly and has a shorter refractory period. This is called the <strong>slow pathway</strong>.</p><p/><p>The origins of the fast and slow pathways are probably in perinodal atrial tissue. These pathways join and enter a final common pathway in the AV node. While atrial tissue above the AV node appears to be part of the reentrant circuit, the bundle of His below the node is <strong>not</strong> a necessary part of the circuit. This can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AVNRT is associated with 2:1 AV block in approximately 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The AV block in this setting is probably a functional infranodal block within the bundle of His [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>His bundle electrograms indicate that reentry is proximal to the recording site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p>Not all patients with AVNRT have evidence of dual pathways during electrophysiology (EP) studies. Conversely, not all patients with dual AV nodal pathways have clinical AVNRT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60369%7ECARD%2F72161\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef60369 graphicRef72161 \">waveform 1A-B</a>). The imperfect association between dual AV nodal physiology and clinical AVNRT was illustrated in a series of 180 patients undergoing EP studies for a variety of indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among the 87 patients with AVNRT, 39 percent did not have clear evidence of dual AV nodal physiology. In contrast, 30 percent of the 66 patients with documented dual AV nodal physiology did not have AVNRT. A concealed atrio-Hisian tract that bypasses the AV node may constitute the retrograde fast pathway in up to a third of all apparently &quot;typical&quot; AVNRT cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, the anatomic and electrophysiologic mechanism of AVNRT may be more complex than the dual AV nodal physiology model suggests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517940374\"><span class=\"h3\">Dual AV nodal pathways during normal sinus rhythm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During normal sinus rhythm, AV conduction occurs as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79760 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal sinus beat enters the AV node and the impulse travels down both the fast and slow pathways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impulse traveling down the fast pathway reaches the His bundle first, creating a refractory wake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impulse traveling down the slow pathway is extinguished when, in the area of the final common pathway, it runs into the refractory wake of the impulse that had traveled down the fast pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517941009\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical AVNRT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 80 to 90 percent of patients with AVNRT present with what is called the common form of the arrhythmia.

Because of the paroxysmal nature of the arrhythmia, the onset and termination of the symptoms are usually sudden. Those with significant heart disease may have additional symptoms such as dyspnea and chest pain. Because atrial activation occurs coincident with ventricular activation during typical AVNRT, atrial contraction occurs when the tricuspid valve is closed, causing rhythmic abrupt rises in venous pressure, and can result in a sensation of neck pounding. Some patients with AVNRT have a feeling of polyuria and experience a diuresis during or after AVNRT; the mechanism probably is related to an elevated mean right atrial pressure and plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide, which are present during the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In a series of 167 supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) patients referred for radiofrequency ablation, the 64 patients with AVNRT reported the following symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations &ndash; 98 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness &ndash; 78 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea &ndash; 47 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain &ndash; 38 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue &ndash; 19 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope &ndash; 16 percent</p><p/><p>Syncope is an uncommon feature of AVNRT and appears to be more likely with high heart rates (eg, heart rate &ge;170 beats per minute).

In contrast to using vagal maneuvers to terminate AVNRT, increased vagal tone may facilitate the induction of AVNRT in some circumstances.

When the P wave occurs shortly after the QRS complex, the fused waveform can produce a pseudo-R' (a second R wave) in lead V1 and a pseudo-S wave in the inferior leads.

Inverted T waves may be seen immediately upon termination or may develop within the first six hours, and can persist for hours to days. The occurrence of negative T waves is not predicted by clinical parameters, tachycardia rate or duration, or the presence and extent of ST segment depression during the tachycardia.

When there is sudden termination of a regular paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) that has 1:1AV conduction associated with AV block but not due to a premature atrial beat (last beat of the tachycardia is a P wave rather than a QRS complex that occurs at the expected timing), then an atrial tachycardia is very unlikely. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In typical AVNRT, the P wave is usually buried within or fused with the QRS complex, resulting in a pseudo-R' (a second R wave) in lead V1 and a pseudo-S wave in the inferior leads. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In atypical AVNRT, the P wave occurs late after the QRS complex, often appearing shortly before the next QRS complex, resulting in a pattern that resembles atrial tachycardia.</p><p/><p>If the diagnosis cannot be confirmed following review of the surface ECG, invasive electrophysiology studies can be performed in an effort to confirm the diagnosis.

Typically, sinus tachycardia is a response to another condition in which catecholamine release is physiologically enhanced or, less commonly, the parasympathetic nervous system withdrawn. In contrast to the abrupt onset and termination of AVNRT, sinus tachycardia has a gradual onset and offset, which typically occurs over 30 seconds to several minutes. Additionally, for the vast majority of patients, sinus tachycardia does not result in symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinus-tachycardia-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinus tachycardia: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H583559263\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AVRT can present in a similar fashion to patients with AVNRT. Both arrhythmias are associated with the abrupt onset of palpitations, and the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) may appear very similar with regular QRS complexes and inverted P waves and a short RP interval that is less than one-half of the RR interval. AVNRT is most easily distinguished from AVRT when evidence of pre-excitation (short PR interval and delta wave) can be identified on prior ECGs during normal sinus rhythm (when available) consistent with an accessory pathway and the potential for AVRT. In the event of concealed pre-excitation, invasive electrophysiology studies may be required to distinguish AVNRT from AVRT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-reentrant-tachycardia-avrt-associated-with-an-accessory-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H583559270\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with AVNRT and AVRT, most patients with focal atrial tachycardia report an abrupt onset of palpitations associated with their episodes of tachycardia. In contrast to AVNRT, the P wave morphology during atrial tachycardia can appear normal or abnormal, depending upon the site of origin of the tachycardia, and the P waves tend to occur prior to the QRS complex, resulting in a long RP tachycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-atrial-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal atrial tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3606594098\"><span class=\"h2\">Junctional ectopic tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is a focal ectopic arrhythmia arising from the AV node region itself. It is a rare arrhythmia most often seen in young children as a congenital arrhythmia or after surgery for congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. JET can be difficult to differentiate from typical AVNRT. However, JET should be suspected when there is ventriculoatrial block during tachycardia and when the tachycardia is initiated by a premature junctional beat. Because the substrate related to JET is near the compact AV node, there is a greater concern for AV block during catheter ablation of JET compared with AVNRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H583559277\"><span class=\"h2\">Other SVTs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other than sinus tachycardia, AVRT, and atrial tachycardia, the remaining SVTs occur far less commonly. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia and sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia have an identical appearance to sinus tachycardia. In contrast to sinus tachycardia, sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia can have an abrupt onset (making it look identical to atrial tachycardia) and requires invasive electrophysiology studies to diagnose. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia tends to persist for days to weeks without the typical associations seen with sinus tachycardia (eg, pain, fever, hypovolemia, etc) and is relatively refractory to rate-slowing medications. Intraatrial tachycardia is a type of reentrant tachycardia seen almost exclusively in patients with underlying structural heart disease and prior cardiac procedures resulting in scar formation (eg, repair of congenital heart disease, catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, etc).

For patients who are hemodynamically stable and able to effectively perform the vagal maneuvers, we recommend at least one or two attempts at a standard Valsalva maneuver, followed by at least one or two attempts using the modified Valsalva maneuver (if AVNRT persists), as the initial treatment for AVNRT rather than another vagal maneuver or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>.</p><p>Vagal maneuvers increase parasympathetic tone, which produces a gradual slowing of conduction in the antegrade slow pathway. Slowing and eventual block in the antegrade slow pathway are the usual cause for arrhythmia termination with these interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], although they can also produce abrupt block in the retrograde fast pathway. In one systematic review, which included 316 patients with a total of 965 episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT; which included both AVNRT and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia), the standard Valsalva maneuver (exhaling forcefully against a closed glottis for 10 to 15 seconds) successfully terminated 45 percent of SVT episodes and was more successful than carotid sinus massage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>To perform a standard Valsalva maneuver, the patient is placed in a supine or semi-recumbent position and instructed inhale normally and then to exhale forcefully against a closed glottis for 10 to 15 seconds. A modified Valsalva maneuver (which begins with the standard Valsalva maneuver and is followed by supine positioning and passive leg raising) has been proposed as an improvement on the standard Valsalva maneuver. In the largest randomized trial of vagal maneuvers for the treatment of SVT, 428 patients with hemodynamically stable SVT were randomly assigned to perform the standard Valsalva maneuver (strain generating 40 mmHg pressure for 15 seconds while in a semirecumbent position) or to perform the standard Valsalva maneuver followed by supine repositioning (placing the patient supine from the upright or semi-recumbent position) and passive leg raise for 15 seconds (214 patients per group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Patients performing the modified Valsalva maneuver with supine repositioning and passive leg raise were significantly more likely to have restoration of sinus rhythm at one minute (43 versus 17 percent in the standard Valsalva group; adjusted odds ratio 3.7; 95% CI 2.3-5.8).

Whenever possible, a continuous 12-lead ECG rhythm strip should be obtained during administration of adenosine, as there are often clues at the time of termination as to the mechanism of the SVT. Adenosine is administered by rapid intravenous injection over one to two seconds at a peripheral site, followed by a normal saline flush. The rapid administration of both the drug and the saline flush is most easily accomplished through a three-way stopcock. The usual initial dose is 6 mg, which can be followed by a dose of 12 mg if not successful. A dose of 18 mg can be used if 12 mg fails to convert the patient to sinus rhythm. Repeated dosing beyond the 18 mg bolus is not usually effective. Patients with orthotopic heart transplants are exquisitely sensitive to adenosine; initial doses should be 1 mg.</p><p>The advantages of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> over other agents include rapid onset and a short half-life.

Because AVNRT is usually well tolerated in the majority of patients, with a variety of safe and effective treatment options, and there are no compelling data favoring one therapy over another, the choice of long-term management strategies is largely influenced by patient preference.

For most patients, we suggest a combination of one or more vagal maneuvers rather than the pill-in-the-pocket approach.</p><p>Patients who have experienced prior episodes and who have been educated on the proper performance of vagal maneuvers are frequently able to terminate subsequent episodes by performing vagal maneuvers on their own. If one or more vagal maneuvers successfully terminate the arrhythmia, patients generally do not need to seek urgent medical attention. Conversely, patients should be instructed to consult with their clinician or seek medical attention if the arrhythmia persists in spite of several attempts at patient-directed vagal maneuvers. (See <a href=\"#H583559782\" class=\"local\">'Vagal maneuvers'</a> above.)</p><p>An alternative patient-directed approach to the management of recurrent AVNRT is the pill-in-the-pocket approach. For selected patients with infrequent, well-tolerated, and long-lasting episodes of AVNRT, a single dose of an antiarrhythmic agent that was previously evaluated under observation can be effective for acute termination of the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/39,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,51,52</a>]. This strategy can both reduce the need for emergency department visits and avoid chronic medical therapy or invasive procedures. This approach has been evaluated with the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, and the class IC antiarrhythmic drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

For these patients, we emphasize the patient-directed approach to the termination of recurrent episodes using one or more vagal maneuvers, with the ability to reassess long-term management options at any time should there be a change in the frequency or severity of recurrences. (See <a href=\"#H843395555\" class=\"local\">'Acute management of recurrent episodes'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagal-maneuvers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vagal maneuvers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H843396139\"><span class=\"h3\">Catheter ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with episodes of AVNRT that are either frequently occurring, refractory to medical therapy, poorly tolerated (eg, associated with near-syncope or syncope, angina, or severe dyspnea), or result in admission to the hospital, we recommend catheter ablation rather than chronic medical therapy as initial long-term management strategy. In such cases, the risks associated with recurrent arrhythmic events (eg, syncope with associated trauma) outweigh the procedural risks. In addition, the potential for definitive therapy makes ablation preferable to medical therapy in this setting.</p><p>Catheter ablation offers the opportunity for definitive cure of AVNRT in greater than 95 percent of patients. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/53-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-59</a>] However, ablation is associated with a small but non-trivial rate of procedural complications. The most significant potential complication of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for AVNRT is AV block (approximately 1 percent, range 0 to 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Older age and baseline PR interval prolongation are predictors of an increased risk of post-ablation AV block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>]. However, due to its high success rate in curing AVNRT by successful slow pathway ablation and low complication rate, catheter ablation is increasingly favored among patients with recurrent AVNRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>The general approach to the catheter ablation of AVNRT is based upon the concept of dual AV nodal pathways. The most common AVNRT circuit (80 to 90 percent) involves antegrade conduction down the slow pathway and retrograde conduction up the fast pathway. The ablation target is the posterior slow pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62108\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62108 \">figure 8</a>) since ablation here carries the lowest risk of AV block, preserves fast pathway function (and a normal PR interval post-ablation), and is facilitated by reliable anatomic and electrophysiologic landmarks. The anterior fast pathway can also be ablated, but this approach is now limited to a few special circumstances since fast pathway ablation results in a long PR interval during sinus rhythm and is associated with a higher risk of heart block. During ablation for atypical &quot;fast-slow&quot; AVNRT, the slow pathway is the usual target. The slow pathway in these patients tends to be posteriorly located near the coronary sinus ostium as with patients who have typical AVNRT. However, there are reports of rare cases of atypical AV nodal reentry where the slow retrograde limb of the circuit is located more superiorly near the compact AV node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>The relative efficacy and costs of catheter ablation and medical therapy were compared in a series of 79 patients with newly documented supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) who were treated with either ablation or pharmacologic therapy, based upon patient preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. After a follow-up period of 12 months, both medication and ablation decreased the frequency of arrhythmia-related symptoms, but ablation was more likely to result in complete abolition of symptoms (74 versus 33 percent).

Because they are effective and well tolerated, the medications that are most commonly used for the chronic suppression of AVNRT are beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>), although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> may also be used. We typically prefer beta blockers rather than calcium channel blockers unless the patient has reactive airway disease or another contraindication, although calcium channel blockers may have fewer side effects. The choice of a starting dose for chronic suppressive medication will vary depending upon the baseline heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p>Among patients who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, or beta blockers and who do not want to pursue ablation, the following antiarrhythmic drugs may be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flecainide</a> (class IC)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propafenone</a> (class IC)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sotalol</a> (class III)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dofetilide</a> (class III)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> (class III)</p><p/><p>The choice of a particular agent will need to be individualized in each patient based on other comorbidities. However, due to the potential for significant toxicities, including proarrhythmia, the use of class I and class III antiarrhythmic drugs for the management of AVNRT should be reserved for rare cases and should be administered in consultation with an electrophysiologist. In particular, because of the risk of toxicities with long-term use, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is usually avoided in young patients.

The physiologic substrate for AVNRT involves dual electrical pathways in or near the AV node. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H517939517\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The simplest concept of AV nodal physiology that allows for reentry involves separate electrical pathways within or proximal to the AV node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79760 \">figure 3</a>). The fast pathway conducts rapidly and has a relatively long refractory period, while the slow pathway conducts relatively slowly and has a shorter refractory period. Both typical and atypical forms of AVNRT can result from reentry involving the fast and slow pathways. (See <a href=\"#H517939555\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with AVNRT most commonly report palpitations, dizziness or lightheadedness, and dyspnea. Because of the paroxysmal nature of the arrhythmia, the onset and termination of the symptoms are usually sudden. Those with significant heart disease may have additional symptoms such as dyspnea and chest pain. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several features seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG) that are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of AVNRT, including the ventricular rate, abrupt onset following an atrial premature beat, the relationship between QRS complexes and P waves, and spontaneous termination with AV block in the absence of a premature atrial beat. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of a patient presenting with a narrow QRS tachycardia and suspected AVNRT is guided by whether or not the patient is experiencing signs and symptoms of hemodynamic instability related to the rapid heart rate (eg, hypotension, shortness of breath, chest pain suggestive of coronary ischemia, shock, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased level of consciousness).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rare patients who are hemodynamically unstable should undergo urgent cardioversion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are hemodynamically stable and able to effectively perform the vagal maneuvers, we recommend at least one or two attempts at a standard Valsalva maneuver, followed by at least one or two attempts using the modified Valsalva maneuver (if AVNRT persists), as the initial treatment for AVNRT rather than another vagal maneuver or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H583559782\" class=\"local\">'Vagal maneuvers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If vagal maneuvers cannot be performed or if they fail to terminate the arrhythmia, intravenous (IV) medical therapy that blocks AV nodal conduction is indicated as the next step. For patients with AVNRT that persists following vagal maneuvers (or in whom vagal maneuvers cannot be adequately performed), we recommend IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> rather than a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H583559788\" class=\"local\">'Adenosine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If both vagal maneuvers and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> are ineffective, or when these options are followed by an immediate recurrence of the tachycardia, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, beta blocker, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> can be used to terminate or prevent recurrent AVNRT. (See <a href=\"#H583559794\" class=\"local\">'Other AV nodal blocking drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to the management of subsequent AVNRT episodes is based around acute management of recurrent episodes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> preventive therapy to reduce or eliminate recurrences. Because AVNRT is usually well-tolerated in the majority of patients, with a variety of safe and effective treatment options, and there are no compelling data favoring one therapy over another, the choice of long-term management strategies is largely influenced by patient preference.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the initial management of recurrent AVNRT, we generally work with the patient to develop a patient-directed treatment approach using either vagal maneuvers or an oral medication (&quot;pill-in-the-pocket&quot; approach). For most patients, we suggest a combination of one or more vagal maneuvers rather than the pill-in-the-pocket approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H843395555\" class=\"local\">'Acute management of recurrent episodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with infrequent and well-tolerated episodes of AVNRT may choose no chronic therapy. For these patients, we emphasize the patient-directed approach to the termination of recurrent episodes using one or more vagal maneuvers. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'No treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with episodes of AVNRT that are either frequently occurring or poorly tolerated (eg, associated with near-syncope or syncope, angina, or severe dyspnea), we recommend catheter ablation rather than chronic medical therapy as initial long-term management strategy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In such cases, the risks associated with recurrent arrhythmic events (eg, syncope with associated trauma) outweigh the procedural risks. In addition, the potential for definitive therapy makes ablation preferable to medical therapy in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H843396139\" class=\"local\">'Catheter ablation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with poorly tolerated symptomatic episodes of AVNRT who are not candidates for or who have declined catheter ablation, chronic medical therapy using beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or antiarrhythmic drugs can be initiated in an effort to suppress recurrent arrhythmias. Our experts typical prefer beta blockers rather than calcium channel blockers or antiarrhythmic drugs as the initial option for chronic medical therapy.
