Individuals take performance-enhancing drugs and substances for a variety of reasons, which include improving athletic performance, increasing alertness, and improving appearance. Although the focus of the news media is on competitive athletes caught using banned hormonal agents (eg, androgens, growth hormones) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], many non-hormonal drugs and other substances for performance enhancement are used, some of which are banned but others of which are permitted and freely available.</p><p>There has been a massive increase in the use of supplements in the sports community over the past couple of decades. Companies worldwide make a range of claims about the ergogenic benefit of many of these supplements. However, current evidence suggests that only a small number have demonstrable benefits for athletes. Importantly, throughout the world quality control for these substances is generally poor and regulations pertaining to their manufacture and marketing are weak, making it difficult for athletes to determine which supplements are safe, effective, and legal.</p><p>This topic will review some of the most common prescription medications and supplements that are not banned and are used by athletes for performance enhancement. Banned performance enhancing drugs, including hormonal agents, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prohibited non-hormonal performance-enhancing drugs in sport&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of androgens and other hormones by athletes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1885371667\"><span class=\"h1\">STIMULANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stimulants are considered both physical and cognitive performance enhancers. Beneficial effects for sport may include improvements in energy level, endurance, anaerobic performance, reaction time, concentration, and alertness. Relatively common potential adverse effects include headache, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, agitation, panic attacks, hypertension, and tachycardia. In extreme cases, stimulants may contribute to myocardial ischemia, stroke, psychosis, heatstroke, or rhabdomyolysis. While many stimulants (eg, methylhexanamine, amphetamine, oxilofrine) are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), a number are permitted and some are only monitored (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>, synephrine, caffeine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>). With the exception of caffeine, which is discussed below, all stimulants and their use for performance enhancement, including urine concentration thresholds for particular agents, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport#H2083718608\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prohibited non-hormonal performance-enhancing drugs in sport&quot;, section on 'Stimulants: Overview of their effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2254305769\"><span class=\"h2\">Caffeine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine was included on the prohibited list from 1980 to 2003, and a urine concentration threshold was used to determine violations, but as of 2016, caffeine is only included on the WADA monitoring list. Athletes may ingest caffeine as part of their diet or as a supplement.</p><p>Caffeine appears to improve exercise capacity during prolonged submaximal exercise (&gt;90 minutes), sustained high-intensity training (20 to 60 minutes), and even short-duration, high-intensity exercise (1 to 5 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]<em>. </em>Caffeine supplementation is therefore likely to have performance benefits for a wide range of sports, ranging from extended endurance events to field and court sports involving short bursts of activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Research has demonstrated improved reaction times and delayed fatigue in simulated taekwondo competition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and improved performance in tennis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The effects of caffeine on high-intensity, single event sports, such as Olympic weightlifting, high or long jumping, sprinting, and throwing (eg, discus, javelin) are not known, although there may be benefit during multiple attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, caffeine was taken as a single dose of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight one hour before exercise, but smaller doses (1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight) have been shown to have an ergogenic effect. No specific dose for eliciting an ergogenic effect during endurance exercise has been defined, but it is thought to be no more than 200 mg total. Some studies suggest there may be benefit from consuming small amounts of caffeine (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> both before and throughout exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Coffee, tea, and cola drinks provide approximately 50 to 150 mg caffeine, but products such as caffeine tablets and some energy drinks contain much higher amounts. The caffeine content of a large number of common beverages and foods is included in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>). The form in which caffeine is taken does not appear to alter its effects.</p><p>Caffeine's mechanism of action remains unclear, and there is significant variation in individual athlete's responses. It is rapidly absorbed (approximately 99 percent is absorbed within 45 minutes) and peak blood concentrations are seen within about one hour of ingestion, with these levels maintained for three to four hours. When consumed in beverages, caffeine is absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout body water. The most rapid absorption occurs by chewing gum or using preparations containing caffeine that allow the compound to be absorbed directly via the oral mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Oral contraceptive use can double the half-life of caffeine via its effects on hepatic microsomal enzyme systems.</p><p>Caffeine has a complex range of actions, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation of adrenaline release</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased cardiac muscle inotropy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased skeletal muscle contractility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased perceived effort and fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sparing glycogen and mobilizing fat (although this effect appears to be short lived and inconsistent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]</p><p/><p>Caffeine is considered safe and in many cultures high daily caffeine intake is the norm. Moderate, daily caffeine intake does not appear to cause dehydration, as was once thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. After repeated use, tolerance can develop for some of caffeine's effects, such as its stimulant properties, but the lipolytic actions are not affected.</p><p>The effects of caffeine supplementation are variable. Non-responders exist, as do individuals who are more sensitive to caffeine's effects, and who may experience irritability, tremor, sleep impairment, and tachycardia even at low doses. Rarely, individuals experience exaggerated side effects such as nervousness and anxiety that impair performance and they should avoid use. Caffeine withdrawal can cause fatigue and headaches, which may be deleterious to the competing athlete. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;, section on 'Athletic performance enhancement'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;, section on 'Alertness'</a>.)</p><p>Caffeine is used widely among athletes in many sports (eg, distance running, cross-country ski racing) and among military personnel to increase alertness and for other purposes. Among elite distance runners (who drink cooled coffee or diluted soft drink), there is anecdotal evidence that caffeine improves performance near the 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mile/30</span> km mark in marathons, possibly due to the glycogen sparing effect, which has increased its popularity for endurance events, including running and cycling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H741529874\"><span class=\"h2\">Guarana</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guarana (<em>Paullinia cupana</em>), a native Amazonian climbing plant from the maple family, contains high levels of guaranine. The chemical guaranine is identical to the chemical caffeine derived from other sources (caffeine is so-called because it was first discovered in the coffee plant; caffeine comprises one to two percent of a coffee bean, but three to eight percent of a guarana seed). Thus, in comparable amounts, guarana seeds contain approximately twice the amount of caffeine as coffee beans. However, the effects of ingested guarana seeds are not just due to guaranine, as guarana contains other xanthine alkaloids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> and theobromine. Guarana is often found in energy drinks, energy &quot;shots,&quot; and herbal teas.</p><p>Guarana is freely available and commonly included in energy drinks and energy supplements, which are widely used as a weight loss supplement and for its stimulant effects. While guarana may have ergogenic benefits, controlled research to determine its effects on athletes is lacking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100453546\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H664586194\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric and neurologic medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants can improve mood and decrease anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These medications are not prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), although some have suggested that such drugs may give certain athletes an unfair advantage. We believe that for athletes suffering from anxiety or depression appropriate therapy with such medications should help to restore energy and motivation, allowing them to optimize their training, performance, and recovery, but these medications are unlikely to provide benefit beyond the athlete's normal baseline function. The use and adverse effects of specific psychiatric and anticonvulsant medications are discussed separately.

While some have postulated that by improving the emotional state of healthy athletes, SSRIs might improve performance, evidence supporting this assumption is lacking. A few small studies involving healthy young men and trained male cyclists given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> reported no improvement in anaerobic power, endurance, maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max), or fatigue time when tested on cycle ergometers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. There are reports of serotonergic medications increasing perceptions of fatigue, both mentally and physically, among users, which would be detrimental to training and competing. Limited studies of <span class=\"nowrap\">serotonin/norepinephrine</span> reuptake inhibitors have shown no benefit to athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3112701548\"><span class=\"h2\">Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are generally used to enhance erectile performance based on their vasodilatory effects.

Little data is available about the effect of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors on athletic performance in normoxic environments. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sildenafil</a> has been shown to increase exercise tolerance in healthy subjects during severe hypoxia both at sea level and altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors have not yet been added to WADA's prohibited drug list. Potential adverse effects include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, hypotension, and blurring of vision.

They are not included in the WADA list of prohibited substances.</p><p>Individuals with the &quot;insertion&quot; allele of the ACE gene appear to have higher maximum oxygen uptake and better response to endurance training compared to those with the &quot;deletion&quot; allele, and it has been reported that many elite athletes in a variety of endurance sports possess the insertion allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As the insertion allele was found to decrease ACE activity, similar to the effects of ACE inhibitors, some have postulated that lower ACE levels may allow athletes to respond better to training, thereby providing an advantage in endurance sporting events. This could be due to lower levels of angiotensin II or higher levels of bradykinin. Nevertheless, the available evidence that ACE inhibitors enhance athletic performance is scant and unconvincing.</p><p>Potential adverse effects of ACE inhibitors (and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) include cough, hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency, and angioedema. A number of UpToDate topics discuss the therapeutic use and side effects of ACE inhibitors.

However, the drug's actual performance-enhancing effects remain the subject of debate, and evidence that it has ergogenic effects is lacking. Side effects from reduced blood pressure are of concern.

This form of performance enhancement has been reported since the 1930s. In a 2007 survey of over 300 elite track and field athletes, alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate were among the supplements listed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the use of buffers was much less than the use of creatine, vitamins, and stimulants, probably due to the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of these substances. Buffering agents are permitted by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</p><p>Anaerobic glycolysis is the primary means of energy production during exercise of near-maximal intensity lasting longer than 20 to 30 seconds. During such intense exercise, intracellular acidity increases. Lactate and hydrogen ions diffuse into the extracellular space once the maximum buffering capacity of the intracellular environment has been reached. The fatigue associated with high rates of anaerobic glycolysis is probably associated more closely with the high concentration of protons, than the accumulation of lactate. Use of blood buffers is based on the theory that by increasing extracellular buffering capacity muscular fatigue is delayed, as more of the excess protons can be cleared from the muscle.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> has been reported to improve training efficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]; however, the effect size is moderate and significantly less for trained athletes than recreational athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The effect size is greater for a single bout of exercise than for repeated bouts. It is believed that athletes participating in activities lasting from 1 to 7 minutes, such as the 800 m run, 200 m swim, and rowing events may benefit most from blood buffers. There is some evidence that participants in team and racquet sports requiring repeated sprints may also benefit.</p><p>The traditional protocol for blood buffers is to ingest 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> (approximately 4 to 5 teaspoons of bicarbonate powder) one to two hours before athletic training. Sodium citrate is taken in doses of 0.3 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> but probably has less efficacy as a buffering agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Investigators have studied alternative strategies for using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, including slowing the administration, altering the form of the bicarbonate, and ingesting it with different fluids or foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The best alkalotic response with the fewest GI side effects was achieved using bicarbonate capsules taken slowly, over 120 to 150 minutes before the beginning of the event. A fluid and a carbohydrate-rich meal taken at the same time improved tolerance. A serial loading protocol has been suggested by some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This involves ingesting 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> each day, taken in four divided doses for six consecutive days. The alkalotic benefit was seen during the ingestion period and for one to two days afterward.</p><p>Significant alteration of body pH can have significant adverse effects, depending particularly on the rate of change from normal acid-base levels. However, such concerns as they relate to buffering for sport are more theoretical than real, as the body is highly adept at rapidly metabolizing alkalizing agents to achieve a normal acid-base balance. In contrast, GI side effects from using buffers are relatively common. These may include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Hence, many athletes avoid using buffers immediately prior to and during competition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3902304505\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2595043214\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of supplements and contamination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many substances are designated or marketed as nutritional supplements, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, extracts, amino acids, metabolites, or any combination of these and other substances. As testing for performance-enhancing drugs has expanded to nearly all levels of competition, athletes have begun to use more over-the-counter nutritional supplements, assuming they are legal, safe, and beneficial. A survey of athletes participating in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games found that over 47 percent reported use of nutritional supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, in many countries the sports supplement industry is poorly regulated, and supplements are sometimes a source of doping violations. This is due to either inadvertent contamination or the intentional addition of additives not included on the label that provide the beneficial effects touted by the manufacturer. Supplements are generally not tested for contamination or accurate labeling, and they frequently contain unlisted substances.</p><p>There is an international movement encouraging larger supplement manufacturers to submit products for testing. Large manufacturers of conventional supplements, such as protein powders, usually follow reasonable quality control practices. Supplements obtained via the internet from small, unregulated companies can be contaminated or mislabeled. In one case series, a number of healthy individuals were found to be taking dietary supplements laced with steroids, and they presented for medical care with complaints including nausea, anorexia, jaundice, severe pruritus, and kidney failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Supplements promoting increased muscle mass are more likely to contain anabolic contaminants, such as nandrolone, stanozolol, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxandrolone</a>. Prohormones, peptide hormones, and releasing factors have also been found in supplements. These include growth hormone releasing peptides (eg, GHRP6, GHRP2), hexarelin (a synthetic growth hormone agonist), and growth hormone secretogogues, such as ghrelin. All such substances are banned by WADA. In a 2004 study, 634 supplements from 215 suppliers in 13 countries were analyzed and 14.8 percent were found to be contaminated with hormones or prohormones, most commonly anabolic androgenic steroid hormones and prohormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Supplements have been contaminated with selective androgen receptor modulators (eg, ostarine, andirine), which act on androgen receptors and exert anabolic effects on muscle and bone. These substances are banned by WADA. Stimulants such as methylhexanamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a>, and sibutramine have been found in supplements, particularly pre-workout powders, energy boosters, and fat burners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Clenbuterol has been detected in a small number of cases of alleged doping violations involving a supplement promoted for weight loss.

It is not prohibited by WADA and has been shown to be effective at improving training and performance of short-duration, high-intensity exercise. Creatine is available in a wide range of commercial products primarily as a powder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Creatine is a naturally occurring substance derived from three amino acids (methionine, glycine, and arginine). Approximately 95 percent is stored in skeletal muscle, with the remainder being located in the brain, testes, and kidneys. Of the creatine in muscle, approximately 65 percent is in the form of phosphocreatine. Phosphocreatine is a source of phosphate for the rapid resynthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which muscles rely on for energy during short&ndash;duration, high-intensity exercise. Creatine supplementation increases the rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery between such bouts thereby enhancing recovery and performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>]. In addition, creatine may have direct cellular effects via upregulation of genes and increased activity of enzymes involved in protein synthesis and other activities with anabolic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Multiple studies have reported improvement in the performance of repeated bouts of 6- to 30-second maximal exercise (eg, sprint, heavy weightlifting), with short recovery periods (20 seconds to 5 minutes) following creatine supplementation. In a meta-analysis of seven trials of young men (&lt;36 years old), creatine supplementation combined with resistance training increased the maximal lifting weight for the bench press and squat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. There was no effect in women or older men, and performance of other types of muscular effort did not improve. The lack of improvement reported in women may be due to the use of lower doses, stemming from concerns about weight gain. According to a review of creatine and its effects, short- and long-term supplementation in female athletes improves strength and power, as well as anaerobic and aerobic exercise measures, with minimal effect on body composition parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Subsequent randomized trials have confirmed that creatine increases maximum power output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. A meta-analysis of 12 trials in patients with muscular dystrophies found a similar increase in muscle strength among those taking creatine compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Results suggesting that creatine enhances performance in endurance sports are inconsistent and further investigation is required, particularly in sports that require high-intensity bursts (eg, road cycling), where supplementation may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Theoretically, creatine supplementation may be useful for sports that involve short intervals of high-intensity effort followed by brief recovery periods, such as American football, rugby, racquet sports, and other team sports.</p><p>Acute loading over a five-day period is probably less beneficial than chronic loading over a 28-day period. Rapid loading is achieved by taking 20 to 25 g (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> in four divided doses for five days (eg, 5 g four times per day for five days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Chronic loading involves consuming 3 g per day over 28 days. Elevated muscle creatine stores are maintained by continued supplementation using doses of 2 to 3 g per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Doses do not differ for power athletes, sprinters, and other athletes.</p><p>It should be noted that up to 30 percent of individuals do not respond to creatine supplementation and will not significantly increase muscle creatine stores. When supplementation ceases, it takes four to five weeks for muscle creatine concentrations to return to pre-supplementation levels.</p><p>Reported side effects of acute creatine ingestion include weight gain (from increased water retention), reduced joint mobility, and muscle cramping, although the evidence for this last purported side-effect is not strong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Nausea, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, and headaches have been reported anecdotally, but are not consistent findings in well-designed studies.</p><p>Although some have claimed that creatine can adversely affect kidney function, limited published evidence and wide experience with this supplement suggest that this is not true in patients with normal baseline renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In fact, creatine may be beneficial when exercising in hot, humid conditions, as the increased body water appears to aid thermoregulation, reduce heart rate, and reduce sweating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The potential long-term consequences of creatine supplementation are unknown and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends it be used only by physically mature, well-developed athletes. For this reason, it is not recommended for adolescent athletes.</p><p>Of note, creatine is sold in a number of different forms other than the recommended creatine monohydrate supplement. These formulations include ethyl ester, nitrate, and phosphate, and are usually more expensive, may contain impurities, and may have no ergogenic benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3399846643\"><span class=\"h2\">Proteins, amino acids, branched chain amino acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proteins and their amino acid constituents have been promoted widely as muscle-building agents. These are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1624659871\"><span class=\"h3\">Branched chain amino acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, valine, and isoleucine, are the most abundant amino acids in muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. They cannot be synthesized in the body, but large amounts are found in red meat and dairy products. Vegetarians can obtain sufficient amounts if they eat an adequate amount and appropriate mix of legumes, nuts, grains, and seeds daily. BCAAs are oxidized in the muscle during exercise.</p><p>Manufacturers of BCAA supplements claim they reduce fatigue, improve endurance, provide fuel for working muscle, and reduce muscle protein breakdown and soreness from exercise. Nevertheless, although BCAAs are widely used by athletes, there is no high-quality evidence of their efficacy, particularly when compared to eating a diet rich in meat, which is less expensive. A chicken breast is said to contain the equivalent of seven average BCAA tablets.</p><p>Laboratory studies have found that the rate of oxidation of BCAAs is too low for the process to make a significant contribution to energy production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. There is limited scientific evidence (much of it in vitro) that BCAAs may accelerate the repair of muscle damage after exercise.</p><p>Adequate amino acids are needed for muscle protein synthesis following resistance exercise, but no studies have examined the effects of BCAA supplementation on protein synthesis in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In addition, no studies have found any change in muscle function as a result of BCAA supplementation. Several studies have reported reductions in muscle soreness after both acute and chronic supplementation, but this is probably most prominent in untrained individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>5-hydroxytryptophan has been implicated in the development of fatigue in athletes. Increased plasma levels of BCAA during exercise may reduce transport of tryptophan into the brain, and this might reduce the synthesis of 5-hydroxytryptophan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A small observational study reported that BCAA supplementation during prolonged exercise improved cognitive function and reduced perceived exertion levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Suggested doses for BCAA supplementation are approximately 2 to 4 g per hour during exercise and the immediate recovery period. They are best consumed as a drink.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253406849\"><span class=\"h3\">Glutathione, glutamate, and glutamine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glutathione is an important intracellular antioxidant that helps to modulate reactive oxygen species. Glutathione also plays an important role in signaling and transcription processes, including some involved in the adaptations of skeletal muscle to athletic training, and some researchers have proposed that increasing glutathione synthesis may enhance athletic performance. As glutathione is synthesized from glutamate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysteine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cysteine</a>, and glycine, these researchers believe that supplementation with these amino acids, may increase glutathione synthesis. Nevertheless, evidence that supplementation with these amino acids improves athletic performance is extremely limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Glutamine is an abundant, nonessential amino acid, an important precursor of glutathione production, and plays a role in acid-base regulation. Glutamine is converted to glutamate during normal metabolism. Glutamine is purported to have anabolic and immune effects of benefit to athletes. Normal dietary intake is approximately 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. During intense athletic training, glutamine stores are depleted, and this has been associated with the depressed immune function seen in some endurance athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that glutamine supplementation stimulates protein synthesis, reduces protein breakdown or muscle soreness, or improves immune function. Observational evidence suggests that glutamine supplementation may reduce the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among endurance athletes training intensively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Glutamine supplementation has few side effects and is well tolerated by most.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3620777598\"><span class=\"h3\">Cysteine and cystine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysteine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cysteine</a>, like glycine and glutamate, is a precursor of the tripeptide glutathione; synthesis of glutathione depends upon the concentration of cysteine, as the other two amino acids are usually plentiful in the body. Glutathione is an important antioxidant. (See <a href=\"#H253406849\" class=\"local\">'Glutathione, glutamate, and glutamine'</a> above.)</p><p>Theoretically, supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysteine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cysteine</a> may improve performance by delaying fatigue, but few studies have been performed to test this concept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Potential side effects, including nausea, diarrhea, and bloating, may occur with large oral doses. The results of one small controlled study using a combination of cystine, a dipeptide of cysteine, and theanine for supplementation in runners suggest that this combination may improve immune response after intense exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Further research is needed to determine whether cystine or cysteine supplementation is useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3050255901\"><span class=\"h3\">Arginine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some researchers claim that arginine improves immune function, increases release of insulin and growth hormone, increases tissue creatine levels, and generally improves performance. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that arginine supplementation improves athletic performance, despite its addition to a number of supplements marketed to bodybuilders and weight lifters.</p><p>Arginine infusions at high doses stimulate marked increases in pituitary growth hormone<em> </em>secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] and insulin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, most oral supplements contain much smaller amounts of arginine (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> and no effect on growth hormone or insulin secretion has been demonstrated in well-designed studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Large doses of arginine may cause significant GI side effects, and relatively large amounts are needed to increase hormone secretion. In contrast, 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity causes greater endogenous secretion of growth hormone than a tolerable oral dose of arginine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3742194148\"><span class=\"h3\">Citrulline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no high-quality evidence that citrulline supplementation improves athletic performance. Nevertheless, it is included in a large number of commercially available supplements. Citrulline is a nonessential amino acid found in protein-rich foods and is used by the body to synthesize arginine, which is important in nitric oxide metabolism.</p><p>Few well-designed studies investigating the use of citrulline as an ergogenic aid have been performed. A controlled study of 17 healthy young men and women reported a slight reduction in the time to exhaustion during treadmill testing among those given citrulline supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Another small trial reported reductions in markers of oxidative damage after intense cycling among those given citrulline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2949565577\"><span class=\"h2\">Colostrum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colostrum is a mammalian lactation product made in the 24 to 72 hours after giving birth. It is rich in growth factors, immune cells, and antimicrobial factors. The results of studies of the performance-enhancing qualities of colostrum supplementation are inconsistent. Colostrum supplements are made from bovine colostrum and are available as liquids, capsules, tablets, or powder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some believe that the growth factors in colostrum provide ergogenic effects. The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) found in colostrum is thought by some to increase strength. However, while some studies of long-term colostrum supplementation (eight weeks of 10 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> have reported increased vertical jump, peak sprint cycle power, and endurance performance, other studies of similar design have failed to show benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Improved immunity is another purported benefit of colostrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. In a secondary analysis of small randomized trials, athletes taking a colostrum supplement experienced fewer upper respiratory tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. A small observational study of cyclists reported less immune suppression after intensive exercise among those taking colostrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>A study carried out in a laboratory accredited by the International Olympic Committee of subjects taking 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of colostrum (125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> IGF-1) over four weeks reported no positive doping tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3032975312\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary antioxidants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antioxidants are taken by some athletes with the intention of improving immune function, and reducing muscle damage and fatigue from training. However, there is some evidence suggesting that chronic intake of antioxidants may impair training adaptations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Common antioxidants taken by athletes include beetroot juice and other substances thought to increase nitric oxide production, such as quercetin, <strong>resveratrol, vitamin E, and N-acetylcysteine</strong>. Tart cherry juice is becoming popular among endurance athletes. (See <a href=\"#H1907095034\" class=\"local\">'Tart cherry juice'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2114774254\"><span class=\"h3\">Nitrates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitric oxide (NO)<strong> </strong>plays a number of metabolic roles, including some involving skeletal muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Preliminary evidence suggests that nitrate supplementation designed to increase the bioavailability of NO may reduce fatigue during exercise. The role of nitric oxide in several organ systems is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nitric oxide, other hormones, cytokines, and chemokines in heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nitric oxide and the kidney&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NO plays important roles in vasodilatation, platelet aggregation, immune function, mitochondrial function, and hormone regulation, particularly around glucose and calcium homeostasis. During physical activity, NO production increases in skeletal muscle. It is thought that NO contributes to the therapeutic effects of exercise, and increases glucose uptake by skeletal muscles during exercise independent of any increase in muscle blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. NO is produced via oxidation of the amino acid L-arginine, and involves the enzyme NO synthase. In addition, NO can be produced by a process not reliant on oxygen, and possibly in acidic conditions, involving the modification of nitrate into nitrite. Given the relative hypoxia and acidic milieu of some tissues during exercise, this mechanism may be important for athletes.</p><p>Nitrate is present in vegetables. Approximately 25 percent of nitrate is converted into nitrite via oral bacteria, and a portion of nitrate intake is converted to NO by the acidic stomach environment. Dietary nitrate produces peak serum concentrations in one to two hours, while nitrite and NO concentrations peak at 2.5 hours. Levels return to baseline at 24 hours. Given the importance of oral bacteria in the metabolic processes, those taking supplements should avoid antibacterial mouthwashes and chewing gums.</p><p>A randomized trial involving nine male athletes reported that supplementation with 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> per day of dietary nitrate improved exercise efficiency, as demonstrated by lower oxygen demand during submaximal work on a cycle ergometer, compared with placebo (ie, sodium chloride supplementation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. A similar trial involving beetroot juice, a naturally occurring rich source of nitrates, reported similar findings about oxygen demand from submaximal exercise, and extended time to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. These findings have been confirmed in studies of running, walking, and cycling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. However, these findings have not been consistently confirmed in high-level athletes, possibly because higher doses are needed. Benefits have also been shown in team sport participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Overall, the evidence suggests a moderate improvement in time to exhaustion and a small improvement in performance, and that these effects are greater in recreational athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>The dosing needed acutely to improve performance in highly trained athletes is thought to be at least 8 mmol (approximately two beetroot juice shots), consumed 2.5 hours prior to competition, but chronic supplementation for the few days prior to a completion may give better results. There is no consistency in supplementation doses or protocols, subject selection, or sports and exercise protocols in studies to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/65,67-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,67-72</a>]. According to a comprehensive review, the reduced oxygen cost of submaximal exercise can be maintained for at least 15 days if supplementation is continued at a dose of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Further research is needed to determine appropriate dosing protocols for training and competition, the true benefits of NO-containing products, and for which sports these purported benefits are most useful.</p><p>Note that <strong>nitrite</strong> salts can be toxic, causing methemoglobinemia. There is one report on an internet forum of an athlete confusing nitrate supplementation with nitrite salts and subsequently developing methemoglobinemia. Nitrite reacts rapidly with hemoglobin converting it to the ferric form (Fe3+ methemoglobin), rather than the usual ferrous (Fe2+) form. The ferric form of hemoglobin binds oxygen but does not release it readily to tissues, causing ischemia. The LD 50 (lethal dose) for oral nitrite (100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> is comparable to that of cyanide. Organic nitrates and nitrites (eg, nitroglycerine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amyl-nitrite-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amyl nitrite</a>) can be fatal at too high a dose. High doses of inorganic nitrates are probably safe, as the body can only convert these slowly to nitrite. However, some experts urge caution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], suggesting that athletes refrain from using nitrate and nitrite salts as dietary supplements, as confusion among the available types could lead to a large unintentional intake that could be life threatening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathogenesis of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although these warnings are important to keep in mind, natural sources of nitrate, such as whole vegetables or vegetable juices, appear to hold little risk. At currently recommended doses, the use of natural products such as beetroot juice seldom cause side effects and such effects are typically mild. Side effects may include mild GI upset and altered color of urine and stool. Long-term studies on the effects of NO supplement use have not been performed. If nitrate-containing supplements are used, athletes should ensure that they are using only the inorganic form of nitrate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1907095034\"><span class=\"h3\">Tart cherry juice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although evidence is limited, tart cherry juice may reduce muscle soreness and improve performance in sports that depend on muscle endurance. The juice can be obtained in bottle or sachet concentrates, a gel, and in a dried form. Many suggest that tart cherry be taken twice daily between five and seven days prior to an endurance race, during extended periods of endurance training, and within 30 minutes of completing an intense training session. Montmorency cherries contain melatonin and hence may have positive effects on sleep when used as a supplement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Studies of tart cherry juice supplementation by athletes are preliminary but report encouraging results. In a controlled study of 20 recreational marathon runners, those given tart cherry juice rather than placebo for five days prior to the day of the race and continuing for two days afterwards demonstrated faster recovery of baseline isometric muscle strength and reduced levels of inflammatory markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Other studies have reported reduced muscle pain after long distance running [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], improved recovery of isometric muscle strength after an intensive, leg-based workout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>], improved strength and reduced pain following eccentric resistance training of the elbow flexors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], and reduced inflammation following intensive cycling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

One found minimal benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], whilst another reported a small improvement in power output, primarily in untrained individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Based on studies to date, a dose of 1 g per day may improve performance during endurance exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2225872764\"><span class=\"h3\">Resveratrol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resveratrol is a polyphenolic flavonoid found in red wine, mulberries, peanuts, rhubarb, and grapes. A range of claims about its health benefits have been made, including prevention of ischemic heart disease, cancer, and peripheral vascular disease, and improved tolerance of stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Animal studies report improved motor skills, higher maximum oxygen consumption, and increases in oxidative muscle fiber. Studies in humans are needed to determine whether there are any ergogenic benefits. There is no widely accepted dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3894134357\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta-alanine and carnosine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carnosine is a dipeptide consisting of beta-alanine and histidine that is important in acid-base regulation in skeletal muscle, acting as an intracellular buffer for approximately 10 percent of the proton buffering that occurs in muscles during high-intensity exercise. In addition, carnosine may protect against oxidative damage and participate in glycation. It may also increase the efficiency of excitation-contraction coupling during muscle fiber contraction. </p><p>Carnosine is found in large amounts in type II muscle. Synthesis is limited by the availability of beta-alanine, which can be increased by eating white meat (eg, poultry breast) or taking a supplement. Increasing muscle carnosine via supplementation with beta-alanine most likely improves athletic performance by directly increasing muscular exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Up to four weeks of supplementation may be needed to achieve significant increases in muscle carnosine. As with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, the buffering effect from carnosine is likely to benefit athletes involved in high-intensity activity lasting 0.5 to 10 minutes; there is no proof of benefit for activities of shorter duration (&lt;30 seconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. </p><p>A meta-analysis of 40 studies of long-term beta-alanine supplementation in 1461 participants and involving a wide range of exercise outcome measures reported a small but statistically significant effect size of 0.18 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Of note, the beneficial effect on exercise-to-exhaustion was greater than that on performance-based tests, such as time trials, and the effect on trained individuals was less than for non-trained persons. Nevertheless, the authors believe that trained athletes in appropriate sports (eg, 4 km cycling, 2 km rowing, middle distance running, and 100, 200, 400, and 800 m swimming) can benefit from supplementation. Sports involving both whole body exercise and isolated limb exercise benefited equally. The meta-analysis found that both continuous exercise protocols and those involving repeated bouts of high-intensity work improved with supplementation. However, testing was not sport-specific so questions remain about the effectiveness of beta-alanine for individual sports involving intermittent bursts of high-intensity work over a prolonged period. Standard dosing among the included studies was 3.2 to 6.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of beta-alanine, ingested in divided doses every 3 to 4 hours for 2 to 4 weeks. </p><p>Long-term supplementation with both beta-alanine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, aimed at increasing both intra- and extracellular buffering capacity, appears to provide greater benefits than beta-alanine supplementation alone, according to limited data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3944396594\" class=\"local\">'Sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate'</a> above.)</p><p>Beta-alanine appears to be widely used, particularly among athletes participating in strength-related sports, middle to long distance track running, and rowing. Upon stopping supplementation, muscle carnosine slowly decreases back to baseline concentrations over 15 or more weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p>With single doses exceeding 800 mg of beta-alanine, many athletes experience pruritus and paresthesias, most likely from direct stimulation of cutaneous nerves. These side effects disappear if a slow-release formulation of beta-alanine is ingested, or if the amount is taken in divided doses, suggesting that the effects are due to a rapid increase in the plasma concentration after ingestion of a powder formulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153727094\"><span class=\"h2\">Carnitine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carnitine is found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and is ingested mainly through meat, fish, poultry, and some dairy. Vegetarians have lower muscle carnitine stores. During intense exercise, carnitine plays a role in the metabolism of carbohydrates and the oxidation of long chain fatty acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. It has been postulated that carnitine supplementation may enhance performance by sparing glycogen at lower exercise intensities, along with improving the efficiency of the citric acid (Krebs) cycle at higher intensities. Several well-controlled studies in both moderately and highly trained athletes have demonstrated no improvement in these parameters, and no increase in muscle carnitine levels following oral supplementation of 2 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> taken for between five days and four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. However, two small trials performed by the same research group report that oral carnitine taken with large amounts of carbohydrate for several months leads to increases in muscle carnitine, sparing of muscle glycogen, improved exercise tolerance, and increased use of body fat stores for energy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].</p><p>Despite limited evidence of benefit, L-carnitine is a common ingredient in fat-loss supplements. Further research is needed to determine the benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carnitine-supplements-levocarnitine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carnitine supplements</a> for athletic performance and body composition. If the benefits are genuine, long-term supplementation in association with large amounts of carbohydrate may be necessary, and this would not suit all athletes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3406087647\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydroxymethyl butyrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydroxymethyl butyrate (HMB) is a fatty acid formed as a breakdown product of leucine. In humans, up to 1 g per day is produced from normal metabolism, with some used for the synthesis of cholesterol, but up to 40 percent excreted unchanged in the urine. HMB was initially used to increase muscle and reduce fat in animals. During the 1990s, use increased among athletes due to claims that it increased lean muscle mass, reduced muscle soreness, and improved aerobic capacity. HMB is also said to have an anticatabolic effects and reduces muscle breakdown. However, available evidence suggests that any ergogenic effect from HMG supplementation in athletes is probably trivial. We suggest that athletes focus on appropriate nutrition to improve protein synthesis, rather than strategies intended to reduce protein breakdown. Doses of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> are common for HMB supplementation, and there appear to be minimal side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>According to a 2003 meta-analysis of studies of dietary supplements for mass and strength gain, HMB and creatine were the only dietary supplements shown to augment lean muscle mass and increase strength when used with resistance training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. However, a subsequent meta-analysis of nine studies involving 394 subjects concluded that HMB caused no significant change in strength or body composition in trained male power athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1369947057\"><span class=\"h2\">Phosphate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple claims have been made about phosphate supplementation and performance enhancement. Several studies report improvements in maximal oxygen consumption, anabolic threshold, and simulated race performances with oral supplementation of 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> taken over three to six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. However, other studies found no benefit. These disparate results may be due to the different forms of phosphate used for supplementation, which can include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium phosphate</a>, calcium phosphate, and mixed buffer supplements containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a>. Purported ergogenic benefit is thought to be from increased levels of 2 3 diphosphoglycerate (2 3 DPG) in red blood cells, which shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, thereby increasing the availability of oxygen to muscle tissues. Side effects typically involve GI issues, so if supplementation is being considered, it should be trialed during training rather than competition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3482945728\"><span class=\"h1\">ENERGY BEVERAGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The consumption of beverages explicitly for sport began with drinks developed to replace the electrolytes and carbohydrates lost during intense physical activity. The original drinks are known as &quot;sports drinks&quot; and contain a low percentage carbohydrate solution and a mixture of electrolytes to allow maximal, rapid absorption in the stomach. The newer generation of beverages, so-called &quot;energy drinks&quot; include a wide variety of stimulants and other additives, including caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, B vitamins, antioxidants, trace minerals, guarana, <em>Ginkgo biloba</em>, ginseng, L-carnitine, and sucrose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Of note, some of these additives may interact with prescription medicines, so care should be taken investigate potential adverse interactions before consuming these drinks. Any purported benefit from energy drinks is most likely due to caffeine, which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H2254305769\" class=\"local\">'Caffeine'</a> above.)</p><p>The amount of caffeine in an energy drink ranges from approximately 50 to 500 mg per can or bottle. Energy beverages should not be used for the purposes of athletic hydration or rehydration. The higher carbohydrate content results in slower absorption from the stomach, and may cause nausea, bloating, cramping, diarrhea, or vomiting. Caffeine may act as a diuretic resulting in increased urine output during and after exercise. For the same reasons, athletes who are dehydrated should not consume energy drinks.</p><p>Consumption of energy beverages, or energy drinks, is widespread and growing. It is reported that 31 percent of 12 to 17 year olds consume energy drinks regularly, with 5 percent of high school students and up to 6 percent of college students consuming one per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Young men appear to be the primary market. Active United States military personnel consume large amounts of energy drinks to assist with alertness and reduce fatigue. According to a 2010 survey of United States troops in Afghanistan, 44.8 percent of respondents drank at least one energy drink per day, and 13.9 percent reported drinking three or more per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>The recommended daily dose of energy beverages is no more than 500 mL, although this depends upon the ingredients. However, sports drink enthusiasts routinely drink much more, sometimes combining them with other supplements or alcohol, which can be particularly dangerous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The effects of energy beverages vary widely depending on the ingredients and amounts consumed. As an example, caffeine content varies from 50 to 500 mg per can or bottle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>)<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Opinions among experts differ about the effectiveness and safety of combining energy drinks with exercise to increase body fat loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. We feel that potential risks outweigh benefits.</p><p>Potential adverse effects of energy beverages may be due to caffeine or other stimulants or ingredients, and may include elevated blood pressure, arrhythmias, seizures, sleeplessness, and mood changes. The consumption of energy drinks, alone and in combination with alcohol or other drugs, is associated with increased visits to the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. The risk of dental caries is often overlooked by those drinking large quantities of sugar-containing energy drinks. Some drinks contain up to 8 teaspoons of sugar, which can contribute to weight gain, hypertension, and diabetes.</p><p>In children and adolescents, the use of energy sports drinks is more likely to cause caffeine intoxication due to a lack of tolerance. Multiple reports found on the website of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) describe cases of acute myocardial infarction, convulsions, cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, spontaneous abortion, arrhythmias, renal and liver impairment, and psychiatric disorders associated with heavy consumption of energy drinks. Massive overuse of these beverages by United States military in Afghanistan has caused insomnia (&lt;4 hours sleep per night) and sleep disruption due to stress and illness, with some soldiers falling asleep while on duty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/permitted-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-substances/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) maintains a list of prohibited substances, which includes stimulants, recreational drugs (eg, opioids, cannabinoids), beta-agonists, diuretics, and other prescription medications. The list can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.wada-ama.org/en/World-Anti-Doping-Program/Sports-and-Anti-Doping-Organizations/International-Standards/Prohibited-List/&amp;token=7YixSmqw1dpiNxLDrYze4ZdPFCu2WrF+7eYBbtcYbnh4u0O4oLcNOmHCP/m6VWeb8C75egIQaR8t0jNQpoa4OsqFuypm2ahVJ8VO4rFMlKkv+FmmLQO0A6mgxPIZXKZyliwdI8ZGDQqw8p/ACnKjEw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=109127\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">WADA website</a>. The contents of the list are revised annually and it is important that sports medicine physicians, competitive athletes, and anyone involved in the care of athletes keep current with its contents.
