The choice of therapies depends upon several factors, including the severity of disease activity when therapy is initiated and the response of the patient to prior therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Common principles that guide management strategies and the choice of agents have been derived from an increased understanding of the disease and evidence from clinical trials and other studies. These strategies include approaches directed at achieving remission or low disease activity by more rapid and sustained control of inflammation by the institution of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy early in the disease course.</p><p>The general principles and treatment strategies that should be applied to the management of RA are reviewed here. The initial therapy of RA and the treatment of patients resistant to initial DMARDs are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

The appropriate use of these therapies is based upon an understanding of a group of general principles that have been widely accepted by major working groups and by professional organizations of rheumatologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].

Such improvements may owe even more to the therapeutic strategies that have been adopted than to the development and use of newer and more potent drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>RA is characterized by acute and chronic inflammation in the synovium, which is associated with a proliferative and destructive process in joint tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>]. Many elements of innate and adaptive immunity are involved in this process, and persistent inflammation may lead to significant and irreversible joint injury as early as the first two years of disease. Therefore, measures aimed at identifying early active disease and at markedly reducing inflammation are essential for modifying disease outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/7,9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,12,13</a>].

The recognition of RA early in the course of inflammatory arthritis, before irreversible injury has occurred, is thus an important element of effective management. (See <a href=\"#H111269724\" class=\"local\">'Early use of DMARDs'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2010, international collaborative efforts led to the development of new classification criteria for RA, which have identified factors that support the early diagnosis of RA among patients presenting with inflammatory arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These criteria are directed at the recognition of patients with early arthritis who are most likely to develop progressive and erosive disease.

The early and ongoing care of patients with RA by a rheumatologist is associated with better disease outcomes, such as reduced joint injury and less functional disability, compared with care rendered primarily by other clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>].</p><p>The initial rheumatology consultation allows the diagnosis to be made or reassessed, the severity of disease to be estimated, and a plan of care to be developed and initiated. The frequency of subsequent specialist care depends upon the severity of symptoms and joint inflammation, the patient&rsquo;s response to treatment, the complexity and risks associated with the therapy, and the preferences of the patient and primary care clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111269512\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPHARMACOLOGIC AND PREVENTIVE THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of nonpharmacologic measures and other medical interventions are important in the comprehensive management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in all stages of disease, in addition to antirheumatic drug therapies.

These radiographs serve as a baseline for evaluating change in the joints during treatment. Radiographs should be repeated every two years in patients in remission or with low disease activity. We view the therapy in use by the patient as insufficient if radiologic evidence of disease progression, such as periarticular osteopenia, joint space narrowing, or bone erosions, appears or worsens during this interval, despite good control of disease activity by other measures. In such patients, based upon our clinical experience, we may intensify or modify the treatment regimen. The clinician must be aware that, in hand radiographs of older patients, coexistent osteoarthritis may account, in part, for joint space narrowing noted near the joints involved with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive for the detection of cartilage and bone abnormalities.

In patients resistant to initial disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy, we either add additional DMARDs to the ongoing regimen or switch the patient to a different DMARD, while also treating the active inflammation with antiinflammatory drug therapy. A description of our treatment approach and the evidence supporting use of particular medications in patients with active disease despite initial DMARD therapy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H169760190\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy for flares'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-nonbiologic-dmard-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial nonbiologic DMARD therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with disease exacerbations despite a preceding period of better control of disease activity (a &ldquo;disease flare&rdquo;), a temporary increase in antiinflammatory therapies, including the use of glucocorticoids, may be required. (See <a href=\"#H169760190\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy for flares'</a> below.)</p><p>The use of strategies for tight control involves frequent periodic reassessment of disease activity, usually at least every three months; adjustment of DMARD regimens every three to six months, if needed, as the primary tool to achieve treatment goals; and administration of antiinflammatory therapies (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and oral and intraarticular glucocorticoids) as an adjunct to DMARDs to maintain control of disease activity until DMARD therapies are sufficiently effective to discontinue glucocorticoids or reduce their use to an acceptably low level. Treatment protocols based upon this general approach are associated with improved radiographic and functional outcomes compared with less aggressive approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/7,53-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,53-62</a>].</p><p>The periodic reevaluation of disease activity using a quantitative composite measure and the use of antiinflammatory drugs, including NSAIDs and glucocorticoids, as bridging therapies are both important elements in the strategy of tight control.

The magnitude of dose increase varies with the baseline dose and with the severity of the flare. An alternative to an increase in the oral dose is the administration of a single deep intramuscular injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> acetate (120 mg in 3 mL) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (60 mg in 1.5 mL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> therapy, usually consisting of three daily infusions of up to 1000 mg, is generally limited to severe flares, particularly those associated with systemic manifestations, such as rheumatoid vasculitis.</p><p/><p>With respect to background drug therapy, an escalation in dose or a modification in drugs is warranted if the patient is flaring frequently or severely.

Disease exacerbations and their systemic effects are usually easily recognized by the presence of many inflamed joints, fever, anemia, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or an elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration.</p><p>The goals of therapy in the patient with end-stage disease are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain relief</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protection of remaining articular structures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relief from fatigue and weakness</p><p/><p>In the absence of inflammation, which requires antiinflammatory medications and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), treatments other than medications may be particularly important in management. These include nonpharmacologic interventions, such as physical and occupational therapy and the use of adaptive devices, and surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-medical-management-of-end-stage-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and medical management of end-stage rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The indications for surgical intervention in patients with RA include intractable pain or severe functional disability due to joint destruction, as well as impending tendon rupture. The timing of surgery is often critical. If one waits too long, there may be so much muscle atrophy from disuse that postoperative rehabilitation is unsuccessful. On the other hand, a decision about joint replacement should take into account the average life of the artificial joint. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-joint-replacement-for-severe-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total joint replacement for severe rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H169761721\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS BY MAJOR GROUPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been developed by major professional organizations, including the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/1,3,4,22,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,22,65</a>].

The evidence used was detailed in a series of systematic literature reviews, and the recommendations were updated in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/4,6,92-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,92-95</a>]. The 2013 recommendations include three overarching principles for the care of patients with RA and a set of 14 recommendations covering major issues in disease management.

As an example, almost 20 percent of patients in one center were severely disabled after 20 years of follow-up (from 1967 to 1987); an additional one-third had died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Patients with RA that required hospital care had at least a twofold increased mortality when compared with those without disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>], and more severe RA was associated with higher mortality rates due to higher rates of myocardial infarction, infection, and certain malignancies, comparable to three-vessel coronary artery disease or to stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Clinical outcomes have improved significantly with changes in drug therapy and in the approach to treatment. These improvements have decreased the need for joint surgery and reduced disability in patients with RA. As an example, in a study involving data from 57 hospitals in Ireland, the number of total hip and knee joint arthroplasties in patients with RA decreased from 1995 to 2010, despite substantial increases in these procedures among the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>An analysis of 1007 patients with RA diagnosed between 1993 and 2011 in the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic found that more intensive treatment strategies adopted over the years of study increased the chances for DMARD-free sustained remissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Moreover, those patients achieving DMARD-free remission had normal functional status when compared with the general population. The average level of disability in RA was found in a longitudinal study of over 3000 patients to have declined by about 40 percent from 1977 to 1998, even prior to the introduction of the biologic DMARDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Similarly, patients with RA seen in a single university clinic from 1984 through 1986 had significantly more disability and greater radiographic evidence of joint injury compared with a cohort from the same clinic seen from 1999 through 2001 (modified Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] disability score on a 0 to 3 scale of 1 versus 0.4, respectively, and Larsen radiographic score on a 0 to 100 scale of 20 versus 3, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients able to achieve remission with combination therapy had significantly less work disability over five years of follow-up compared with patients with incomplete responses to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

The following four markers of adverse prognosis can be used to identify patients who may require more aggressive pharmacotherapy, especially in early stages of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional limitation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraarticular disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid factor positivity or presence of anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bony erosions documented radiographically</p><p/><p>Other factors associated with a worse prognosis include concurrent medical disorders, cigarette smoking, lack of formal education, and lower socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Older age, female sex, and the presence of the shared epitope have also been associated with a poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Thus, prompt diagnosis, early recognition of active disease, and measures to quickly achieve and maintain control of inflammation and the underlying disease process, with the goal of remission or low disease activity, are central to modifying disease outcome. The application of these principles in the management of patients with RA, together with the development and use of newer and more potent drugs, has resulted in significant improvement in the outcomes of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H6421551\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2703960\" class=\"local\">'Early recognition and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An expert in the care of rheumatic disease, such as a rheumatologist, should participate in the care of patients suspected of having RA and in the ongoing care of patients diagnosed with this condition. The treatment of patients with RA by a rheumatologist is associated with better disease outcomes compared with care rendered primarily by other clinicians. (See <a href=\"#H2704646\" class=\"local\">'Care by a rheumatologist'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic measures, such as patient education, psychosocial interventions, and physical and occupational therapy, should be used in addition to drug therapy. Other medical interventions that are important in the comprehensive management of RA in all stages of disease include cardiovascular risk reduction and immunizations to decrease the risk of complications of drug therapies. (See <a href=\"#H111269512\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic and preventive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all patients diagnosed with RA be started on disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy as soon as possible following diagnosis, rather than using antiinflammatory drugs alone, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Better outcomes are achieved by early compared with delayed intervention with DMARDs. (See <a href=\"#H111269724\" class=\"local\">'Early use of DMARDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the use of tight control treatment strategies to guide adjustments in the treatment regimen, rather than less aggressive approaches (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Tight control involves reassessment of disease activity on a regularly planned basis with the use of quantitative composite measures and adjustment of treatment regimens to quickly achieve and maintain control of disease activity if targeted treatment goals (remission or low disease activity), rather than an undefined degree of improvement, have not been achieved. Such tight control treatment strategies are associated with improved radiographic and functional outcomes compared with less aggressive approaches. (See <a href=\"#H6422708\" class=\"local\">'Tight control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H344392649\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of disease activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing prior to therapy should include a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), aminotransferases, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ) should have a baseline ophthalmologic examination, and most patients who will receive a biologic agent should be tested for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Screening for hepatitis B and C should be performed in all patients. Some patients may require antiviral treatment prior to initiating DMARD or immunosuppressive therapy, depending upon their level of risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. (See <a href=\"#H111270327\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use antiinflammatory drugs, including NSAIDs and glucocorticoids, as bridging therapies to rapidly achieve control of inflammation until DMARDs are sufficiently effective. Some patients may benefit from longer-term therapy with low doses of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H169759626\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive role of antiinflammatory agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RA has natural exacerbations (also known as flares) and reductions of continuing disease activity. The severity of the flare and background drug therapy influence the choice of therapies. Patients who require multiple treatment courses with glucocorticoids for recurrent disease flares and whose medication doses have been increased to the maximally tolerated or acceptable level should be treated as patients with sustained disease activity. Such patients require modifications of their baseline drug therapies. (See <a href=\"#H169760190\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy for flares'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The monitoring that we perform on a regular basis includes testing that is specific to evaluation of the safety of the drugs being used; periodic assessments of disease activity with composite measures; monitoring for extraarticular manifestations of RA, other disease complications, and joint injury; and functional assessment. (See <a href=\"#H111270903\" class=\"local\">'Assessment and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors in RA management that may influence the target or choice of therapy include the disabilities or functional limitations important to a given patient, progressive joint injury, comorbidities, and the presence of adverse prognostic factors.
