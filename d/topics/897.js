Dual antiplatelet therapy is often used after placement of a drug-eluting stent, and fatal stent clotting may develop if antiplatelet medications are prematurely stopped.

It has been noted that patients with long eyes (axial length &gt;25 mm) have an increased risk of needle injury during a retrobulbar (intraconal) block, usually due to penetration of the posterior pole of the globe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. A history of myopia in childhood or the presence of globe-enveloping intraorbital hardware such as a scleral buckle are indications that the eye may be longer than average [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The anesthesiologist must be vigilant for evidence of the oculocardiac reflex (resulting in bradycardia or asystole) or accidental injection of local anesthetic into a blood vessel (resulting in systemic toxicity) or into the central nervous system (resulting in brainstem anesthesia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although rare, these situations might necessitate airway support or other emergent intervention. (See <a href=\"#H95783039\" class=\"local\">'Oculocardiac reflex manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H26346691\" class=\"local\">'Systemic complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supplemental oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is frequently administered at the time of initial sedation and during the block to reduce the risk of hypoxemia during sedation for the regional block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedatives (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>) with a short duration of action are administered immediately before the regional block to reduce or eliminate the pain of needle insertion and injection of the local anesthetic. The goal of sedation is to minimize anxiety while providing the maximum degree of safety. An alternative technique is administration of small doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> (eg, 10 to 20 mg increments) until the patient loses consciousness for approximately two minutes while the block is performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The anesthesiologist should avoid prolonged sedation, since subsequent performance of the surgical procedure requires an awake and cooperative patient.

If supplemental O<sub>2</sub> is required, we use an O<sub>2</sub> blender or adaptor to deliver a concentration &le;30 percent, at the minimum level required to maintain adequate hemoglobin O<sub>2</sub> saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>). This reduces risk of fire if an ignition source (eg, electrocautery) is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In the United States, topical analgesia is the most common technique, followed by peribulbar (extraconal) block or, less commonly, retrobulbar (intraconal) block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Sub-Tenon blocks are most popular in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Typically, general anesthesia is reserved for adults who are unable to communicate, cooperate, or remain stationery during eye surgery, and for children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The technical considerations, benefits, and drawbacks of each of these anesthetic techniques are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95783534\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical anesthesia</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General principles</strong> &ndash; Topical anesthesia (with or without supplemental intracameral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) is a good choice for short, uncomplicated procedures in which the surgeon does not require complete akinesia (eg, cataract surgery with phacoemulsification through a small corneal incision), as well as in the following situations:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fully anticoagulated patients, due to concerns regarding the risk of bleeding during needle insertion to perform a regional technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with monocular vision (ie, unilateral blindness), due to concerns regarding the risk of vision loss in the remaining eye because of perforation or penetration of the globe during performance of a regional eye block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique</strong> &ndash; The anesthesiologist, ophthalmologist, or specialized nurse applies local anesthetic eye drops or gels on the cornea and conjunctiva (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 2% jelly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proparacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">proparacaine</a> 0.5% solution, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracaine</a> 0.75% solution) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Anesthetic gels produce greater levels of drug in the anterior chamber than equal doses of drops and may provide superior surface analgesia. However, gels may form a barrier to bactericidal agents; thus, they are administered after antiseptic solutions. Just before beginning surgery, the ophthalmologist may choose to supplement topical anesthesia with intracameral injection of 1% lidocaine into the anterior chamber of the eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benefits</strong> &ndash; Topical analgesia is the simplest technique to anesthetize the anterior chamber of the eye and may be used as the sole anesthetic technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Risk of complications is low compared with other anesthetic techniques because no needle is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Vision is quickly regained in the postoperative period.

The needle is typically shorter and is placed less deeply and at a different angle compared with placement for retrobulbar block. Theoretically, these modifications make the peribulbar block less likely to result in perforation of the globe posteriorly, injury to the optic nerve, or injection into the central nervous system with resultant brainstem anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Also, peribulbar block produces more reliable akinesia of the orbicularis oculi, the muscle that closes the eyelids, compared with retrobulbar block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/2,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29</a>]. This is due to the larger volume and distribution of local anesthetic injected (see <a href=\"#H115132139\" class=\"local\">'Retrobulbar block (intraconal block)'</a> below). Specifically, the patient cannot open the eyelid because cranial nerve III is blocked. Although the patient may be able to close the eyelid because cranial nerve VII is usually not completely blocked, the lid closure force is typically weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For all of these reasons, the peribulbar technique is more popular, but the retrobulbar block has not been entirely replaced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H115132139\" class=\"local\">'Retrobulbar block (intraconal block)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique </strong>&ndash; Typically, a single injection of 6 to 12 mL of local anesthetic is injected into the inferolateral quadrant. This produces an excellent block without the need for a second injection in most patients, due to spread of the injectate in all directions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternate technique is a single injection of 5 to 6 mL of local anesthetic in the extreme inferolateral quadrant of the orbit, with additional injection of 3 to 5 mL in the medial quadrant (medial peribulbar), if necessary to produce adequate anesthesia and akinesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97887 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-elective-eye-surgery/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A needle &le;1.25 inches inch long is recommended to reduce the risk of injuring structures deep in the orbit. We use an Atkinson needle, which has a relatively blunt tip compared with the traditional needle used for intramuscular injections. The Atkinson needle may enhance the operator's ability to identify scleral tissue if it is encountered before perforation of the globe.

General anesthesia is also considered in patients who are unable to lie supine comfortably (eg, patients with severe and symptomatic congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or back pain) or unable to remain motionless (eg, patients with tremor disorders such as Parkinson disease, severe anxiety, or claustrophobia). Furthermore, most children require general anesthesia because they are not able to reliably remain motionless during eye surgery.</p><p>During general anesthesia for eye surgery, a deep plane of anesthesia is maintained to avoid laryngospasm, coughing, or other movement. Endotracheal intubation is often used, particularly in patients at risk for aspiration during general anesthesia.

(See <a href=\"#H539154656\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative consultation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H179360071\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a high risk of clotting and embolic complications who are receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in therapeutic doses should usually continue these medications before cataract surgery. (See <a href=\"#H539154656\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative consultation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24533571\" class=\"local\">'Ophthalmic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ophthalmologist's measurement of axial eye length on the preoperative ultrasound is reviewed, since long eyes (axial length &gt;25 mm) have an increased risk of needle injury during retrobulbar (intraconal) block. (See <a href=\"#H539154656\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative consultation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24533571\" class=\"local\">'Ophthalmic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedatives (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) and opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>) with a short duration are administered to reduce or eliminate pain during needle insertion and injection of local anesthetic for a regional block. An alternative technique is administration of 10 to 20 mg increments of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> until the patient briefly loses consciousness while the block is performed. (See <a href=\"#H87838173\" class=\"local\">'Needle insertion for regional anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Supplemental oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is administered to reduce the risk of hypoxemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the surgical procedure itself, sedation is minimized to reduce the risk of side effects that may jeopardize the patient's ability to cooperate during surgery. (See <a href=\"#H87838187\" class=\"local\">'Surgical procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compressed room air or an O<sub>2</sub> concentration &lt;30 percent (to minimize fire risk) is delivered at a rate of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> under the surgical drapes to minimize rebreathing of expired carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetic techniques for cataract surgery include the topical and regional techniques, as well as general anesthesia (see <a href=\"#H307473\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia for cataract surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H539154677\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic techniques'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use of topical analgesia as the sole anesthetic technique avoids the potential complications of both needle insertion and local anesthetic injection. A drawback is that topical analgesia will not provide akinesia of the eye. (See <a href=\"#H95783534\" class=\"local\">'Topical anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Regional anesthesia may be provided by peribulbar, retrobulbar, or sub-Tenon block. Peribulbar (extraconal) regional blocks are most commonly used in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H35219389\" class=\"local\">'Regional anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>General anesthesia is reserved for patients who cannot communicate or cooperate or who have severe anxiety or claustrophobia, as well as some patients who are unable to lie supine comfortably (eg, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or severe back pain), and also for children. Either endotracheal intubation with a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent or a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may be used during cataract surgery. Maintenance of a deep plane of anesthesia is necessary to avoid laryngospasm, coughing, or other movement. (See <a href=\"#H133444024\" class=\"local\">'General anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For intraocular glaucoma surgery, anesthetic techniques are the same as those for cataract surgery. Some surgeons prefer general anesthesia for trabeculectomy; in these cases, complete akinesia is ensured by titration of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent according to monitoring of muscle relaxation with a peripheral nerve stimulator and maintenance of a deep plane of anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H133443914\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia for intraocular glaucoma surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For vitreoretinal surgery (eg, detached retina), a regional anesthetic technique or general anesthesia (without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a>) is preferred, rather than topical anesthesia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrous oxide</a> is <strong>contraindicated</strong> when injection of gas (eg, SF<sub>6</sub> or C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>) is planned or was previously used to create a &quot;bubble&quot; to tamponade a detached retina, unless complete bubble absorption is documented. (See <a href=\"#H539154772\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia for vitreoretinal surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious eye complications of regional blocks include globe or optic nerve perforation, and retrobulbar hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H107873290\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare serious systemic complications include inadvertent administration of local anesthetic into a blood vessel or the central nervous system, with resultant cardiorespiratory depression or arrest. (See <a href=\"#H107873290\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oculocardiac reflex can occur when pressure is applied to extraocular muscles and may result in bradycardia, junctional rhythms, hypotension, or asystole. Management includes discontinuing manipulation of the extraocular muscles and administration of an anticholinergic medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a>).
