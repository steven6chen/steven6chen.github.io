The heart is divided into 4 sections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56936\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56936 \">figure 1</a>), called &quot;chambers.&quot; VPBs start in 1 of the 2 lower chambers, called the &quot;ventricles.&quot;</p><p>VPBs are caused by a problem with the heart's electrical system, in which the ventricles send abnormal electrical signals. These signals cause the extra beats.</p><p>VPBs are common. They can happen in healthy people. They can also happen in people who have different types of heart disease. VPBs are very common after a heart attack.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4313459\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of VPBs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with VPBs do not have any symptoms. A doctor or nurse might find VPBs when he or she listens to your heart during an exam. Or doctors might find VPBs if they do a heart test called an &quot;electrocardiogram,&quot; also called an ECG or EKG.</p><p>If you do have symptoms, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like the heart is beating hard, beating fast, or seems to skip a beat &ndash; These heartbeat changes are called &quot;palpitations.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or lightheaded</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pounding feeling in the neck</p><p/><p>You might be more likely to notice VPBs when you lie quietly in bed at night or lie on your left side.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4313474\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your heart often seems to beat fast or hard, or skip beats, talk to your doctor or nurse. VPBs are common, but you might have another condition that is causing the symptoms. VPBs can also be a sign of a more serious heart condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4313489\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for VPBs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms. He or she can also do the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram &ndash; This test, also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG,&quot; measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Holter monitor &ndash; This is a small, portable machine you wear that records all your heart's electrical activity over 1 or 2 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76605 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p>If you have VPBs often or the doctor thinks you could have a specific heart condition, he or she can order other tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4313504\"><span class=\"h1\">How are VPBs treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what is causing the VPBs and whether they cause symptoms. If you do not have symptoms, you might not need any treatment. If the VPBs are caused by another heart condition, doctors will treat that condition.</p><p>Possible treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to control the speed or rhythm of your heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;ablation&quot; &ndash; During this procedure, the doctor uses heat (called &quot;radiofrequency ablation&quot;) or cold (called &quot;cryoablation&quot;) to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending the abnormal electrical signals. You might have this treatment if medicines do not control VPBs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4313519\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-can-go-wrong-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What can go wrong after a heart attack?
