Although the propensity for the rash to develop clearing in the center and a &quot;bull's eye&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62480 \">picture 1A</a>) is well publicized, most commonly the rash is uniformly erythematous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57414 \">picture 1B</a>). This was illustrated in a cohort of 118 adult patients with erythema migrans and <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection (confirmed by culture or polymerase chain reaction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The lesion was homogeneous in 59 percent, had central erythema in 32 percent, and central clearing in only 9 percent.</p><p>Erythema migrans lesions usually are flat and without scale; they may be pruritic or burning but are rarely painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. The lesions occasionally may have vesicular or necrotic areas in the center related to an intense inflammatory response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67424 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. Vesicular-appearing erythema migrans lesions usually are not pruritic; this lack of pruritus and the large area of erythema without vesicles help to distinguish vesicular erythema migrans from contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Erythema migrans is annular, but the lesion can vary greatly in shape and rarely is perfectly round. A perfectly round lesion should prompt consideration of other diagnoses, such as nummular eczema or erythema multiforme.

Among these, the bite was at a site different than the lesion in 38 percent (indicating that the infection was transmitted by a different, unrecognized tick).</p><p>Thus, the absence of a recognized tick bite does not exclude Lyme disease, as long as exposure to a vector tick in an endemic area is a possibility. Likewise, a history of a tick bite on a different part of the body, or in the more distant past, should be viewed as evidence of potential tick exposure rather than evidence that the lesion is not erythema migrans.

Erythema migrans will persist and increase in size. If the lesion disappears in a few days without treatment, it is unlikely to have been erythema migrans. In the minority of cases in which diagnostic uncertainty remains after 24 to 48 hours of observation, acute and convalescent serum samples may be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
