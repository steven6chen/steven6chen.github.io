Health care providers should be familiar with commonly used terms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86993\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86993 \">table 1</a>). Gender identity-affirming care, for those who desire, can include hormone therapy and affirming surgeries as well as other procedures such as hair removal or speech therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-women-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will use the term transgender in the broadest sense to include any person with incongruence between gender identity and external sexual anatomy at birth. The evaluation and management of transgender women are discussed here. The evaluation and management of transgender men, the primary care of the transgender adult, and gender nonconformity in children and adolescents are reviewed separately.

The new guidelines replace the term &quot;transsexual&quot; with &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; or &quot;gender incongruence&quot; and specify detailed professional qualifications for clinicians who diagnose, assess, or treat individuals with gender <span class=\"nowrap\">dysphoria/gender</span> incongruence. Specifically, they now suggest that decisions regarding social transition for prepubertal youth be made in conjunction with a mental health or similarly experienced professional. They continue to recommend the management and monitoring of transgender adolescents, and adult men and women by a multidisciplinary team, as well as counseling patients about the time course of hormone-induced physical changes and options for fertility preservation. We agree with the updated guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1084578518\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2887581498\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous research had suggested that 0.3 to 0.5 percent of the adult population was transgender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-women-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The prevalence of transgender depends upon the definition used to classify a person as transgender. In studies that included only individuals who had undergone hormone therapy, gender-affirming surgery, or had diagnostic codes documenting transgender, the reported prevalence of transgender was 7 to 9 per 100,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-women-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, studies that include transgender status based upon self-report indicate a prevalence of transgender of approximately 871 per 100,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-women-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

While some transgender individuals present to mental health providers for diagnosis, it is now common for these individuals to see primary care providers for initial guidance. Some transgender individuals will present directly to endocrinologists for hormone prescriptions. Typically, transgender adults report gender incongruence throughout their lives, starting well before puberty.</p><p>Although many transgender adults will be straightforward in their presentation, others will have the diagnosis confounded by mental health concerns. Therefore, the diagnosis of gender dysphoria or gender incongruence should be made by qualified medical providers who are both facile with the diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-women-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>] and have the necessary experience assessing the mental health issues, such as mood disorders, that might confound the diagnosis.</p><p>Parallel to the greater exposure in public media, greater societal acceptance, and greater access to care, transgender individuals now tend to present at a younger age than in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-women-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1601994357\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some transgender individuals have coexisting psychiatric conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-women-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Unrealistic expectations that subjects may have about other benefits of hormonal and surgical treatment must be addressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Contacts with other transgender individuals who are already undergoing treatment may be helpful in shaping an individual's expectations of what can be achieved and what problems, personally and socially, may arise during transgender medical treatment. A supportive network of family and friends is often important.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Physical changes may be more or less apparent in certain individuals, relating to other underlying biology. Some physical changes may be quickly apparent, while others manifest over months and years. The rapidity and degree of physical changes may be difficult to predict and may not relate to the dose of hormones. Transgender individuals should be prepared for regular monitoring of changes and the assimilation of those changes into daily living.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risks and benefits of treatment </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The patient should be aware of the risks and benefits of hormonal or surgical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-women-evaluation-and-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

While hypogonadism carries risk to bone health and should be addressed, both male and female hormone patterns, along with the entire continuum in between, can be safe. Similarly, surgical requirements may vary significantly among patients. For example, for transgender men, chest reconstruction surgery (breast reduction) is often the highest priority, with only a minority of patients choosing other surgeries.

The treatment goal is to maintain hormone levels in the normal physiological range for the target gender.</p><p>Historically, some transgender individuals self-medicated with hormones for a variety of reasons, including fear of rejection by health care providers, delays in initiation of hormone therapy, and the cost of undergoing treatment.

Core components of the DSM-5 diagnosis of gender dysphoria include longstanding discomfort with the incongruence between gender identity and external sexual anatomy at birth along with interference with social, school, or other areas of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-women-evaluation-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Transgender women (male-to-female, MTF)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Priorities for many transgender women include elimination of facial hair growth, induction of breast formation, and a more female <span class=\"nowrap\">fat/muscle</span> distribution. To accomplish this, a reduction of the biological effects of androgens to normal female levels is required.</p><p>Administration of estrogens alone will suppress gonadotropin output and, therefore, androgen production, but dual therapy with one compound that suppresses androgen secretion or action and a second compound that supplies estrogen is more effective. In addition, dual therapy may permit the use of lower doses of estrogen (see <a href=\"#H768005246\" class=\"local\">'Major adverse events'</a> below).

Some transgender women choose to reduce hormone doses to balance the degree of feminization with the level of sexual function, while others report no need for dose adjustments.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transgender individuals should have their gender incongruence diagnosed by medical professionals with appropriate experience. It is necessary to ascertain that there is persistent gender incongruence and that the person is able to understand the risks and benefits of intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1490293740\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before initiating transgender hormonal or surgical treatment, the clinician should counsel the patient about risks and benefits of the hormonal or surgical therapy, including impact on fertility, as well as realistic expectations about outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H2446719192\" class=\"local\">'Counseling before treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For transgender women (male-to-female [MTF]), we suggest either antiandrogen therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproterone acetate</a> [CPA]) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), combined with estrogen therapy (transdermal or oral 17-beta estradiol) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We suggest against the use of ethinyl estradiol because of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Transgender women (male-to-female, MTF)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transgender women treated with estrogen should follow the same screening guidelines for breast cancer as for nontransgender women. (See <a href=\"#H3444626406\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with the Endocrine Society guidelines that transgender individuals should follow the screening guidelines for all tissues present, independent of expressed gender. For example, prostate cancer screening should be done in individuals with a prostate. (See <a href=\"#H3444626406\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that transgender women receiving hormone therapy be monitored to avoid supraphysiologic serum estradiol (E2) concentrations (eg, maintain E2 levels &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [734 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L])</span> and to verify that serum testosterone levels reach the normal physiologic female range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67967\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67967 \">table 4</a>). Serum potassium should be checked in those taking a potassium-spironolactone, and some experts suggest monitoring serum prolactin and triglycerides because of exogenous estrogen administration. (See <a href=\"#H3444626406\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender confirmation (or affirmation) surgeries can be considered after living one year in the desired gender role and after one year of continuous hormone therapy (unless there a medical contraindication to hormone therapy). This criteria applies to genital surgeries but <strong>not</strong> to other procedures such as chest reconstruction. Details of surgery are described above.
