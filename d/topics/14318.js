It is the most common gynecologic complaint among adolescent females. Management is directed toward excluding pelvic pathology (secondary dysmenorrhea) and selecting medication appropriate to the patient's individual characteristics and symptom severity. </p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adolescents will be discussed in this topic review. Evaluation and treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adult women is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary dysmenorrhea in adult women: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adult women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1211682625\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For clinical purposes, dysmenorrhea is divided into two broad categories: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary dysmenorrhea</strong> refers to the presence of recurrent, crampy, lower abdominal pain that occurs during menses in the absence of demonstrable disease that could account for these symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secondary dysmenorrhea</strong> has the same clinical features but occurs in women with a disorder that could account for their symptoms, such as endometriosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112838 \">table 2B</a>). Secondary dysmenorrhea is more common among women in the fourth and fifth decades of life, but occasionally occurs in adolescents. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of dysmenorrhea among adolescent females ranges from 60 to 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Many adolescents report that the dysmenorrhea interferes with daily activities, such as school, sporting events, and other social activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. However, only 15 percent of females seek medical advice for menstrual pain, suggesting that some cases are mild or effectively self-medicated, but also signifying the importance of screening all adolescent females for dysmenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Dysmenorrhea generally does not occur until ovulatory menstrual cycles are established, which occurs from months to several years after menarche, depending on the individual rate of maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Approximately 18 to 45 percent of teens have ovulatory cycles two years postmenarche, 45 to 70 percent by two to four years, and 80 percent by four to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Dysmenorrhea occasionally accompanies anovulatory cycles, especially if heavy bleeding and clots are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysmenorrhea appears to be caused by excess production of endometrial prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), or an elevated PGF2 alpha:prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) ratio. Excessive levels of endometrial, but not plasma, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha have been detected in women with primary dysmenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These compounds can cause dysrhythmic uterine contractions, hypercontractility, and increased uterine muscle tone leading to uterine ischemia. They also can account for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea via stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract. The role of prostaglandins in the pathogenesis of primary dysmenorrhea is supported by the observation that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; which are prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors) often alleviate the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33859972\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary symptom of dysmenorrhea is crampy lower abdominal pain or back pain. In severe cases, the pain is not substantially relieved by analgesics and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dizziness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65347 \">table 1</a>). The pain and associated symptoms typically begin several hours prior to the onset of menstruation and continue for one to three days. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of an adolescent female presenting with menstrual cramps begins with a complete medical and menstrual history to assess the severity of the symptoms and exclude secondary causes of dysmenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112838 \">table 2B</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete history should include the following information (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112839 \">table 2A</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age at menarche</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Duration of menstrual bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Menstrual flow assessment &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Interval between menstrual periods (from first day of one period to the first day of the following period)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>First day of last two menstrual period</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom history </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial onset of symptoms and progression over time.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Relation of symptoms to periods.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence or absence of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, back pain, dizziness, fatigue, and headache during menstruation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impact of symptoms on daily activities such as school attendance, sports participation, and other activities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medication use &ndash; Type, dose, and timing in relation to the onset of cramps and perceived effectiveness in terms of pain relief and ability to engage in all daily activities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The severity of the disorder can be categorized by a grading system based upon the degree of menstrual pain, presence of systemic symptoms, and impact on daily activities. One system for grading severity is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65347 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual history </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Current sexual activity and type of contraception used</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of sexually transmitted infections and history of pelvic inflammatory disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3607137044\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with primary dysmenorrhea, the abdominal examination is unremarkable when the patient is not menstruating and may include generalized lower abdominal tenderness during menses. A finding of localized tenderness, with or without a mass, suggests a diagnosis other than primary dysmenorrhea. </p><p>A pelvic examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic ultrasound should be performed in all females with severe symptoms (eg, grade 3 dysmenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65347 \">table 1</a>)) to exclude the causes of secondary dysmenorrhea. A pelvic examination is also suggested for all sexually active adolescents with dysmenorrhea, even if the symptoms are mild, but may be deferred if the history is typical for primary dysmenorrhea. In nonsexually active females, a pelvic exam may be deferred unless symptoms persist despite treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1836490854\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinical diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea can be made if the characteristic clinical symptoms develop in an ovulatory adolescent and secondary dysmenorrhea (ie, painful menstruation in the presence of pelvic pathology) have been excluded. The extent of the evaluation to exclude secondary causes varies depending on whether the history is typical or atypical for primary dysmenorrhea and the severity of the symptoms. The evaluation should include a pelvic examination for patients who are sexually active (but may be deferred if the pain is mild and typical for primary dysmenorrhea), and also either a pelvic exam or ultrasound for all patients with severe symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A focused history and physical examination usually is sufficient to distinguish primary dysmenorrhea from secondary dysmenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112839%7EPEDS%2F112838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112839 graphicRef112838 \">table 2A-B</a>) and from other disorders. As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anatomic abnormalities</strong> &ndash; A history of painful menses commencing at menarche is unlikely to be primary dysmenorrhea because most females are anovulatory for several months to several years after menarche. Possible causes for this pattern of pain include incomplete fenestration of the hymen or other developmental anomalies of the m&uuml;llerian duct. To easily exclude a hymenal abnormality, vaginal introitus should be visualized, and a cotton swab may be inserted into the vagina. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychogenic contributors</strong> &ndash; A complete psychosocial history may suggest other causes for abdominal pain such as depression, substance abuse, or stress secondary to abuse or other trauma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endometriosis</strong> &ndash; Menstrual pain that has become progressively worse over time is characteristic of endometriosis, which may present as cyclic or noncyclic pain. Endometriosis is a common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea. A pelvic exam may reveal a tender cul-de-sac or uterosacral ligament nodularity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis in adolescents: Diagnosis and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease</strong> &ndash; Adolescents who have had pelvic infections (eg, gonorrhea, chlamydia) may develop adhesions that result in pelvic pain, especially during menstruation. On examination, patients with acute pelvic infections typically have lower abdominal tenderness on external palpation, and cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on bimanual exam. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The presence of pelvic pain between menses, or that is unrelated to menses, also suggests secondary dysmenorrhea. Gynecologic causes of acute pelvic pain are outlined in the table; these and other causes of pelvic pain are discussed in a separate topic review (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75310 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-the-adolescent-female#H13206035\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in the adolescent female&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of menstrual pain and limitation of daily activities will help guide treatment decisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65347 \">table 1</a>). General measures for therapy include patient reassurance and education about options for medications and their appropriate use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who do not desire contraception, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered first-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. NSAIDs are also good adjuncts for patients who choose hormonal contraception. In randomized trials of NSAIDs, approximately 70 to 90 percent of patients have effective pain relief, a value that is greater than that with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/8-12,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12,17,18</a>]. NSAIDs are also generally more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> for treatment of dysmenorrhea. </p><p>NSAIDs should be started at the onset of menses and continued for the first one to two days of the menstrual cycle or for the usual duration of crampy pain. They are most effective when begun early in the course of symptoms because of their effects on prostaglandin synthetase. Patients with severe symptoms should begin taking NSAIDs one to two days prior to the onset of menses. If a patient fails to respond to an NSAID of one class, it is reasonable to switch to an NSAID of a different class. This is because patients vary in their response to a particular drug, perhaps because of differences in pharmacodynamics. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ibuprofen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> (from the propionic acid group of NSAIDs) are used commonly for the treatment of dysmenorrhea in clinical practice. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefenamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mefenamic acid</a> (from the fenamate class) is unique in that it both inhibits prostaglandin synthetase and blocks the action of the prostaglandins that are already formed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A trial of mefenamic acid should be considered for patients who do not respond to the propionic acid group of medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-therapeutic-use-and-variability-of-response-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NSAIDs should be taken with food to minimize side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation or bleeding. Because selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are associated with some serious adverse events, we generally use NSAIDs that are nonselective COX inhibitors, as described above. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal therapies such as oral contraceptives (OCs) are appropriate as second-line therapy for patients who are not sexually active but who fail to respond to or cannot tolerate NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. They may also be appropriate for first-line therapy in patients who are sexually active because they prevent both dysmenorrhea and pregnancy. </p><p>OCs prevent menstrual pain by suppressing ovulation, thereby decreasing uterine prostaglandin levels. An additional mechanism may result from the reduction of menstrual flow after several months of use. Randomized trials in adults and adolescents demonstrate moderate efficacy in pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The efficacy of OCs for primary dysmenorrhea has not been directly compared with NSAIDs. Any OC is likely to be effective, and cycle selection is determined by patient preference. If conventional formulations (21 days of <span class=\"nowrap\">medication/7</span> days of placebo) do not provide sufficient relief, formulations with a reduced hormone-free interval or an extended cycle may be beneficial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adult women&quot;, section on 'Hormonal contraception'</a>.) </p><p>Other hormonal contraceptives that are useful for dysmenorrhea include transdermal patch or vaginal ring, injectable or implantable contraceptives, or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices. The relative benefits of these methods and data from studies on adults are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adult women&quot;, section on 'Hormonal contraception'</a>), as are other considerations for selection of a contraceptive method for adolescents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraception-issues-specific-to-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraception: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If treatment with one of these modalities (ie, NSAIDs or hormonal contraception) fails after two or three menstrual cycles, the first step is to assess and address any problems with adherence to the therapy. If adherence does not seem to be the problem, we suggest a course of treatment with addition of the other modality. Treatment with both hormonal contraceptives and NSAIDs may be effective in women who remain symptomatic on either drug alone. Other treatment options include changing to a different modality of hormonal therapy, such as long-acting progesterone implants or depot medroxyprogesterone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women#H15853989\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adult women&quot;, section on 'Progestin-only methods'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be followed closely for the first few months after treatment is initiated to evaluate the response and adherence to therapy. Adolescents who fail to respond to first- or second-line treatments, have recurrent pain, or have symptoms that worsen should be reevaluated for the causes of secondary dysmenorrhea, and consideration should be given to referral to an adolescent gynecologist or adolescent medicine specialist to further assess for underlying pelvic pathology (secondary dysmenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112838 \">table 2B</a>)), and consideration of alternate forms of hormonal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1044702465\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other approaches to pain relief are based on limited evidence in adults: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-care approaches to pain relief (eg, heat therapy and exercise) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adult women&quot;, section on 'Self-care'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complementary or alternative medicine (eg, acupuncture) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adult women&quot;, section on 'Complementary or alternative medicine'</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
