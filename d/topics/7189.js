People with fibromyalgia also have &quot;tender points,&quot; places on their body that hurt when they are touched. No one knows what causes fibromyalgia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482540506\"><span class=\"h1\">Can fibromyalgia be cured?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people seem to get over fibromyalgia. But in most people it cannot be cured. Even so, people can learn to deal with the condition and lead fairly normal lives. Fibromyalgia does not get worse over time, and it is not life-threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482540513\"><span class=\"h1\">Does fibromyalgia cause symptoms besides muscle pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. People with fibromyalgia often say they feel tired all the time and that sleep does not help them feel rested. They can also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flu-like symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression and anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Too many or too few bowel movements (diarrhea or constipation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the bladder or the need to urinate in a hurry or often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the jaw</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482540520\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for fibromyalgia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no test. To diagnose it, doctors and nurses have to go by symptoms. First they look for other causes of the symptoms, such as arthritis or a hormone problem. They diagnose the condition if they can find no other cause, and if a person has:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle pain all over their body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe tenderness in at least 11 of the 18 known &quot;tender points&quot; of fibromyalgia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53200\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53200 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p>Sometimes doctors diagnose fibromyalgia without checking for the number of tender points a person has. This might happen if the person has many areas that feel painful, and is bothered a lot by symptoms that are often caused by fibromyalgia. Some of these symptoms include feeling tired when getting up in the morning and during the day, and having trouble thinking clearly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482540527\"><span class=\"h1\">How is fibromyalgia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are medicines and strategies to help with the symptoms of fibromyalgia. But there is no one treatment that works for everyone. You and your health care team will need to work together to find the right mix of treatments for you. In general, treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relieve pain, improve sleep, or improve mood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to learn exercises and stretches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working with a counselor</p><p/><p>To get the best treatment, many people need a team that includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A doctor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A physical therapist</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Someone trained in mental health (such as a social worker or counselor)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482540534\"><span class=\"h1\">Be open to medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse might suggest that you take a medicine normally used to treat depression or seizures. If so, be open to trying it. Even if you are not depressed and do not have seizures, these medicines can help. That is because they work on the brain areas that deal with pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482540541\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is really important that you stay active. Walking, swimming, or biking can all help ease muscle pain. If you have not been active, it might hurt a little more when you start. But being active can help improve your symptoms.</p><p>It is also really important that you try not to be too negative about your life. Your outlook has a big effect on how you feel pain. Do your best to be positive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482540548\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic fatigue syndrome (systemic exertion intolerance disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
