Diabetes frequently coexists with other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, sometimes known as the metabolic or cardiometabolic syndrome. However, diabetes mellitus confers an increased risk for cardiovascular events independent of other traditional risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Such patients should have appropriate aggressive individualized diagnostic workup. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease#H4874544\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Noncoronary atherosclerotic disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In nearly all patients with diabetes, the results of screening will generally not change medical therapy, since aggressive preventive measures, such as control of blood pressure and lipids, would already be indicated. However, the use of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> may not be warranted in all asymptomatic diabetic patients, since &gt;30 percent of asymptomatic diabetic patients may not have CHD and the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score could be considered as a measure to <span class=\"nowrap\">detect/exclude</span> CHD.

In patients with type 1 diabetes, CVD becomes the leading cause of death after 10 years of duration and accounts for 40 percent of all deaths after 20 years of duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most studies on cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes have been performed in patients with type 2 diabetes, who are typically older at disease onset than those with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Although the study results are not all consistent, several studies have suggested that patients with type 2 diabetes without known CHD have at least similar (if not higher) risk of cardiovascular mortality as patients without diabetes who had prior myocardial infarction (MI) or known CHD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98646 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. As an example, in a meta-analysis that included 698,782 patients (from 102 prospective studies) with no known history of CHD, MI, angina, or stroke, diabetes was associated with a significantly increased risk of CHD, stroke, and other vascular disease (adjusted HR for CHD 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While the incidence of CHD has declined over time with improvements in risk factor modification, diabetes appears to persist as a significant risk factor for CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>By contrast, other large observational studies have not supported the concept of diabetes as a CHD-equivalent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98656\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98656 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The disparate results across studies are likely explained by differences in patient populations, follow-up duration, lifetime risk, or use of lipid-lowering and other primary prevention therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Among a retrospective, population-based cohort study of over 9 million adults (379,000 with diabetes), the transition to high cardiovascular risk (10-year event rate risk of greater than 20 percent) among persons with diabetes occurred at age 41 years in men and 48 years in women, approximately 15 years earlier than in individuals without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a smaller prospective study of 5934 men (285 with diabetes, mean age 63 years) who were followed for 10 years, risk of CHD events increased with increasing duration of diabetes, and risk of CHD in patients with diabetes for 12 or more years was equivalent to the CHD risk for patients with prior MI and no diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Accordingly, various professional societies from the United States and Europe, who publish guidelines and recommendations, consider patients with type 2 diabetes to be at high risk for CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. These observations are consistent with the American Diabetes Association practice guideline, which considered the transition to high cardiovascular risk to occur above age 40 in patients with both type 2 and type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Some patients with diabetes have a blunted appreciation of ischemic pain, which may result in atypical anginal symptoms, silent ischemia, or even silent myocardial infarction (MI). Silent ischemia in diabetes is thought to be caused at least in part by autonomic denervation of the heart. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-and-risk-factors-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-diabetes-mellitus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of and risk factors for coronary heart disease in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Silent ischemia and infarction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Silent myocardial ischemia: Epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of asymptomatic CHD in patients with diabetes depends significantly on the method of screening and what test result is considered diagnostic for CHD. The presence of asymptomatic CHD has been evaluated in a variety of ways. These include assessment with computed tomography (CT; either for coronary artery calcifications or to assess coronary artery stenosis), stress testing to detect silent ischemia, and invasive coronary angiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1425863334\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electron beam CT scan (or multi-detector row CT [MDCT]) can noninvasively detect the presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and coronary artery atherosclerosis. CAC scanning estimates the total atherosclerotic burden but is not necessarily predictive of significant coronary artery stenosis. Additionally, noninvasive CT coronary angiography can detect coronary stenoses with a high degree of accuracy.

Intuitively, screening to detect early CHD and provide targeted treatment for patients with evidence of CHD would seem reasonable. However, as with screening for any condition, there are multiple issues that must be addressed concerning the possible role of screening for CHD in such patients (eg, the accuracy of screening tests, how easily testing can be performed, the safety of testing, costs of testing, available interventions that improve outcomes, etc). The general approach to screening is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evidence-based-approach-to-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evidence-based approach to prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1425863352\"><span class=\"h2\">Purpose of screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with screening for any condition, the primary purpose of screening for CHD in patients with diabetes would be to identify patients whose prognosis could be improved with an intervention (in this case, medical therapy for risk factors or coronary revascularization). In nearly all patients with diabetes, the results of screening will generally not change medical therapy, since aggressive preventive measures, such as control of blood pressure and lipids, would already be indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the case of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, there are real risks of gastro-intestinal bleeding, so detection of CHD by screening would justify the therapy and alter the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio in favor of aspirin use in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

However, the use of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> may not be warranted in all asymptomatic diabetic patients, since &gt;30 percent of asymptomatic diabetic patients may not have CHD and the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score could be considered as a measure to <span class=\"nowrap\">detect/exclude</span> CHD.
