As a result, the demands for cardiac output decrease; in addition, hypothyroidism directly alters cardiac function through changes in myocyte-specific gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic will review the cardiovascular manifestations of overt hypothyroidism. Other symptoms of hypothyroidism and cardiovascular manifestations of subclinical hypothyroidism are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major cardiovascular changes that occur in hypothyroidism include a decrease in cardiac output and cardiac contractility, a reduction in heart rate, and an increase in peripheral vascular resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F85918\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85918 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. There are also significant changes in modifiable atherosclerotic risk factors, including hypercholesterolemia, diastolic hypertension, carotid intimal media thickness, and endothelial derived relaxation factor (nitric oxide), which accompany overt hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac contractility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All measures of left ventricular performance are impaired in both short- and long-term hypothyroidism, leading to a reduction in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. There is also a decrease in the rate of ventricular diastolic relaxation; as a result, compliance and diastolic filling are impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The reduced ventricular performance is probably multifactorial. Possible mechanisms include increases in afterload and changes in expression of the genes for myocardial calcium regulatory proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Several enzymes involved in regulating calcium fluxes in the heart are controlled by thyroid hormone, including the calcium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase and phospholamban [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Hypothyroidism-dependent decreases in the expression and activity of these enzymes could potentially impair systolic performance and diastolic relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Beta-adrenergic receptor expression is also decreased, resulting in a blunted response to catecholamine mediated increases in inotropy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid hormone relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Conversely, hypothyroidism causes a decrease in the release of endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), which in turn promotes contraction of these cells, thereby increasing peripheral vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This change results in reductions in cardiac output (in part because the heart cannot increase contractility to compensate) and tissue perfusion. Tissue oxygen utilization is also decreased; thus, arteriovenous (A-V) oxygen extraction is not different from that in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms and signs of cardiovascular dysfunction are not common or prominent in patients with hypothyroidism. Those that do occur include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68946 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/1,3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exertional dyspnea and exercise intolerance, although these symptoms are probably due to skeletal muscle dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension resulting from the increase in vascular resistance and the fall in endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac dysfunction with poor contractility, dilatation, or pericardial effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema, often nonpitting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusions, which occur in approximately 25 percent of patients and may be quite large</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rhythm disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to a slow pulse rate, hypothyroid patients may have ventricular premature beats and rarely ventricular tachycardia with a long QT interval (torsade de pointes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>). This can be especially problematic in patients with underlying ischemic heart disease or known ventricular arrhythmias. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> can produce hypothyroidism and, in turn, further predispose the ischemic heart to ventricular arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-and-thyroid-dysfunction#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone and thyroid dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Hypothyroidism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid hormone plays a role in blood pressure homeostasis. In patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, withdrawal of thyroxine (T4) for six weeks results in an increase in serum norepinephrine and aldosterone concentrations and an increase in blood pressure with a greater rise in diastolic pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">(126/85</span> compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">120/76</span> mmHg at baseline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Diastolic blood pressure may vary directly with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels over the entire spectrum of thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>].</p><p>Approximately 20 to 40 percent of hypothyroid patients have hypertension, even though cardiac output is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. The hypertension is primarily diastolic and the pulse pressure is diminished. In hypertensive hypothyroid patients, the serum levels of renin are low and there is an increased prevalence of salt sensitivity confirming the importance of the increase in systemic vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. Among large groups of patients with hypertension, however, hypothyroidism is a contributory factor in only a small percentage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The upstroke of the pulse may be slow and the left ventricular apical impulse weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The heart may be enlarged and the heart sounds distant. These findings, plus dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and edema, may make it seem as if the patient has congestive heart failure. While heart failure due solely to hypothyroidism is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], in patients with underlying or preexistent cardiac disease, the presence or development of hypothyroidism leads to more severe heart failure, higher levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and worse short-term hospital outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Electrocardiograms may show low voltage and nonspecific ST segment and Q wave changes. Occasionally, large pericardial effusion can occur, characterized by a high protein and cholesterol content (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65059\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65059 \">image 1</a>). These are rarely hemodynamically important and should be managed with thyroid hormone replacement, not by needle or surgical drainage. The latter can lead to hemodynamic worsening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary artery disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with angina pectoris probably have symptoms less often if they become hypothyroid because they are less active and peripheral oxygen demands decrease. The occurrence of anginal-like pain in some hypothyroid patients and the frequent occurrence of hypercholesterolemia diastolic hypertension, and elevated homocysteine levels have led to suggestions that hypothyroidism is associated with accelerated coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p>Potential mechanisms in addition to lipid abnormalities and diastolic hypertension include elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein and endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/2,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,14</a>].</p><p>The potential risk of coronary artery disease in subclinical hypothyroidism is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periorbital edema and nonpitting edema of the hands and feet are characteristic features of hypothyroidism, albeit rare today. Nonpitting edema is due to interstitial accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> and chondroitin sulfate), with associated extravascular water retention at the same time that plasma volume is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/3,4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,15</a>]. Some patients have pitting edema of the feet and legs, probably secondary to an increase in albumin content of the interstitial fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Ascites, pleural, and scrotal effusions may also be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Lipids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dyslipidemia is common in hypothyroidism. The usual findings are high serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations. Some patients have high serum very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol concentrations, and a few have hypertriglyceridemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-in-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities in thyroid disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The spectrum and frequency of lipid abnormalities that can occur was illustrated in a report from the Mayo Clinic which evaluated 295 patients with hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Hypercholesterolemia was present in 56 percent of the patients, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia in 34 percent, and hypertriglyceridemia in 1.5 percent; only 8.5 percent had a normal lipid profile. The changes in serum LDL cholesterol have been related to reduced expression of LDL receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and decreased hepatic and biliary LDL cholesterol clearance.</p><p>Another study evaluated the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients referred for hyperlipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among 1509 consecutive patients, hypothyroidism was present in 4.2 percent, approximately twice the incidence in the general population. In view of the increased prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, especially in patients with overt hypothyroidism (TSH &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> the question of optimum therapy often arises. If hypothyroidism is present, the patient should be treated for three to four months with thyroid hormone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>, T4) to normalize serum TSH (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults#H2890829890\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;, section on 'Goals of therapy'</a>). If the serum lipid concentrations are not then normal, specific lipid-lowering therapy may be indicated. It should be noted that hypothyroidism may predispose to the development of statin-associated myopathy and that use of statins may &quot;unmask&quot; hypothyroid myopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statin-muscle-related-adverse-events#H107314231\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statin muscle-related adverse events&quot;, section on 'Hypothyroidism, hypovitaminosis D, and other disorders'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Homocysteine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with hypothyroidism have high serum homocysteine concentrations, which fall toward, if not to, normal with T4 therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Creatine kinase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many hypothyroid patients have high serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations. The isoenzyme distribution is almost completely MM, with less than 4 percent constituting MB, indicating skeletal muscle, not myocardial, origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, as many as 14 percent of patients with hypothyroidism have a raised serum concentration of CK-MB, which can be confusing in the evaluation of chest pain. This problem is obviated by measurement of serum troponin I, which is normal in hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The changes in cardiovascular function in hypothyroidism respond to replacement therapy with T4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63451 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In older patients or those with a history of angina, it is wise to begin therapy with a low dose of T4, as an example 12.5 or 25 mcg daily, because of the possibility of inducing an arrhythmia or an exacerbation of angina. T4 equilibrates slowly and its onset of action is slow, so that the dose should not be increased for four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;, section on 'Older patients or those with coronary heart disease'</a>.)</p><p>A 1961 report remains the largest and best study of the effects of beginning thyroid hormone on chest pain in patients with hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among 1503 hypothyroid patients, the following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifty-five patients had angina before thyroid hormone replacement therapy. During therapy, 21 improved, 25 had no change, and 9 had more angina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty-five patients developed new angina during therapy, six during the first month, six during the first year, and 23 after one year.</p><p/><p>Thus, angina may improve, and it does not often appear during T4 replacement therapy.</p><p>In patients with overt hypothyroidism, T4 therapy for several months raises the 24-hour heart rate by approximately 10 percent. It usually does not increase the frequency of premature atrial beats (22 of 25 patients had no increase in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]) or of premature ventricular beats. TSH measurements should guide treatment to assure precise replacement into the optimal euthyroid range.</p><p>The clearance of many drugs, including anticoagulant drugs, is decreased in hypothyroidism. In patients being treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulation, the dose required to maintain a therapeutic prothrombin time increases during hypothyroidism, and this increase is reversed with restoration of a normal TSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The long-term cardiovascular outcomes of patients treated for overt hypothyroidism are unclear. A population-based study assessed mortality and vascular outcomes among 15,889 treated individuals and 524,152 subjects in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Excess cardiovascular morbidity from arrhythmias and non-fatal ischemic heart and cerebrovascular disease was observed among those treated for hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, there was no increase in all-cause mortality. The long-term cardiovascular effects of treatment of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are reviewed separately.
