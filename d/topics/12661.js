The pathophysiology, etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of achalasia, as well as a more detailed discussion of pneumatic dilation, botulinum toxin injection, and surgical management of achalasia, are presented separately.

This can be accomplished by mechanical disruption of the muscle fibers of the LES (eg, pneumatic dilation [PD], surgical myotomy or per-oral endoscopic myotomy) or by pharmacological reduction in LES pressure (eg, injection of botulinum toxin, oral nitrates, or calcium channel blockers) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90738\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90738 \">algorithm 1</a>). For any of the invasive therapies, results are best for patients with type II achalasia. Unfortunately, no treatment can reverse the degeneration of ganglion cells, restore the lost esophageal neurons, and hence, normalize esophageal function. Consequently, available treatments do not normalize swallowing; they merely improve it. Moreover, the efficacy of all these treatments tends to decrease with time. Consequently, patients will require long-term follow-up and will frequently need repeated or alternative treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3681795\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are at low surgical risk, either graded pneumatic dilation or laparoscopic surgical myotomy with a partial fundoplication should be performed to treat achalasia. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a promising new endoscopic technique for performing myotomy, but its proper role in the treatment of achalasia is not yet clear. Pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy should be performed in high-volume centers of excellence, and the choice of initial therapy should be guided by the patients' age, gender, preference, and local institutional expertise. Patients with the best outcomes after pneumatic dilation are those older than 40 years, women, those with narrow esophageal diameter, and those with a type II pattern by high-resolution manometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>].

Pneumatic dilation should be performed by an experienced endoscopist. Multiple endoscopies are frequently required for graded pneumatic dilation. Patients undergoing pneumatic dilation must be good surgical candidates because perforations related to pneumatic dilation often require surgical repair. The technique, efficacy, and complications of pneumatic dilation are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumatic dilation and botulinum toxin injection for achalasia&quot;, section on 'Pneumatic dilation'</a>.)</p><p>Pneumatic dilation appears to be the most cost-effective treatment for achalasia and has the advantage of being less invasive as compared with surgical myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Initial success rates are high (85 percent at one month) and sustained in the short term (12 to 24 months), but efficacy wanes over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Over four to six years, nearly one-third of patients have symptom relapse and require retreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/7,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14-16</a>]. Postprocedure complications include symptomatic esophageal perforation (2 percent) and heartburn (15 to 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>]. Subsequent pneumatic dilations are progressively less likely to result in a sustained remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Other forms of therapy should therefore be considered for patients who have recurrent or persistent dysphagia after three pneumatic dilations. Patients who have undergone pneumatic dilation also appear to be at an increased risk of intraoperative complications if they subsequently require surgical myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumatic dilation and botulinum toxin injection for achalasia&quot;, section on 'Efficacy of PD'</a>.)</p><p>Esophageal dilation with a soft, tapered dilator (bougienage) or through-the-scope balloons are highly effective in the treatment of peptic esophageal strictures, but usually provides only temporary and incomplete relief, if any, for patients with achalasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Definitive dilation therapy requires more forceful stretching of the LES than can be achieved with bougienage or through-the-scope balloons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1988524\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical myotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical myotomy, in which the LES is weakened by cutting its muscle fibers, has been the primary alternative to pneumatic dilation for achalasia. Heller myotomy is often performed laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/17,18,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,21-25</a>]. Since LES disruption can cause reflux esophagitis, it is frequently combined with an antireflux procedure such as a fundoplication. Operative management of achalasia is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical myotomy for achalasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initial symptom relief is achieved in 90 percent of patients, which is similar to the rate reported in studies looking at medium-term outcomes (12 to more than 36 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As with endoscopic procedures, symptom relief wanes with time and patients often require retreatment. In one study that included 62 patients who had undergone surgical myotomy and partial fundoplication at a mean follow-up of 19 months, 38 percent of patients reported some dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another large retrospective study included 1461 patients with achalasia, of which 81 percent had pneumatic dilatation and 19 percent had surgical myotomy as their first procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The cumulative risk of any subsequent treatment (dilatation, myotomy, or esophagectomy) after 1, 5, and 10 years was 37, 56, and 63 percent after initial pneumatic dilatation and 16, 30, and 37 percent after initial treatment with myotomy.</p><p>Surgery is less cost-effective as compared with pneumatic dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The other major disadvantages of surgery are the protracted recovery period and associated complications. Complications of laparoscopic myotomy include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), perforation, pneumothorax, bleeding, vagal injury, and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, the risk of GERD is significantly lower if an antireflux procedure is performed (9 versus 32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Pneumatic dilation has been performed in patients who fail to improve following surgical myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia#H37208945\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical myotomy for achalasia&quot;, section on 'Postoperative complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumatic dilation and botulinum toxin injection for achalasia&quot;, section on 'PD after failed myotomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3682822\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical myotomy versus pneumatic dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic Heller myotomy is superior to a single pneumatic dilation in terms of efficacy and durability. However, the superiority of surgical myotomy over pneumatic dilation is less evident when compared with graded pneumatic dilation, which involves repeated dilations as mandated by the clinical response.</p><p>In a retrospective study of 179 patients that compared pneumatic dilation with Heller myotomy, the success of Heller myotomy was comparable with pneumatic dilation after six years of follow-up (57 versus 44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Success was defined as dysphagia or regurgitation less than three times per week or freedom from alternative treatment.</p><p>A meta-analysis that compared graded PD with laparoscopic surgical myotomy included three randomized trials with 346 patients published between 2007 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. After up to one year of follow-up, surgical myotomy was more effective than PD (86 versus 77 percent) and was associated with fewer adverse events (0.6 versus 5 percent). However, there were no differences in postprocedure lower esophageal sphincter pressure, rate of gastroesophageal reflux, and quality of life.</p><p>The largest trial in the meta-analysis included 201 patients who were assigned to either pneumatic dilation or laparoscopic Heller myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients were followed for a mean of 43 months. In an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference between the groups with regard to therapeutic success. At one-year follow-up, the success rate for pneumatic dilation was 90 percent, and for laparoscopic myotomy it was 93 percent. After two years, the success rates were 86 and 90 percent, respectively. In addition, after two years of follow-up there was no significant difference between the groups with regard to lower esophageal sphincter pressure, esophageal emptying, quality of life, or esophageal acid exposure. Subgroup analyses found that patients younger than 40 years were at increased risk of requiring redilation after pneumatic dilation. However, a number of factors should be considered when interpreting the results of this trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. First, the protocol for pneumatic dilation used in this trial was rigorous, involving up to three sets of balloon dilations over a period of &gt;2 years, with individual sets including as many as three separate dilation sessions. Each dilation session generally means a day lost from work. By contrast, the inconvenience of Heller myotomy is primarily &quot;up front,&quot; involving the operation itself and the postoperative recovery. Furthermore, esophageal perforations occurred in approximately 4 percent of patients treated with this rigorous pneumatic dilation protocol, requiring hospitalization and, in some cases, emergency surgical repair with an open (rather than laparoscopic) procedure. In addition, the balloon dilations and operations in this trial were performed by very experienced gastroenterologists and surgeons. It is not clear that their excellent results can be reproduced in community practices. </p><p>After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in success rates between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3682212\"><span class=\"h2\">Botulinum toxin injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Botulinum toxin therapy can be considered in patients who are not good candidates for more definitive therapy with pneumatic dilation or surgical myotomy. Botulinum toxin injected into the LES poisons the excitatory (acetylcholine-releasing) neurons that increase LES smooth muscle tone. The net effect is a decrease in basal LES pressure in patients with achalasia, which allows emptying of the esophagus when esophageal pressures exceed that of the partially paralyzed LES.</p><p>Botulinum toxin injection has the advantage of being less invasive as compared with surgery and can be easily performed during routine endoscopy. Initial success rates with botulinum toxin are comparable to pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, patients treated with botulinum toxin have more frequent relapses and a shorter time to relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Greater than 50 percent of patients with achalasia treated with botulinum toxin require retreatment within 6 to 12 months. Repeated botulinum toxin injections may also make a subsequent Heller myotomy more challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The technique of botulinum toxin injection to treat achalasia, efficacy, and complications are discussed in detail separately.

Calcium channel blockers and nitrates have been used to treat achalasia with variable success. Calcium channel blockers result in symptomatic improvement in 0 to 75 percent of patients and sublingual nitroglycerine results in symptomatic improvement in 53 to 87 percent of patients. However, side effects may occur in up to 30 percent of patients on calcium channel blockers and nitrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].

During POEM, the endoscopist makes an incision in the esophageal mucosa, and the endoscope is passed through that incision into the esophageal submucosa, creating a submucosal tunnel that is extended distally into the gastric cardia. A diathermic scalpel then is passed through the endoscope to sever the muscle of the muscularis propria in and around the LES. Unlike surgical myotomy, which often is combined with fundoplication to prevent reflux, POEM includes no antireflux procedure. Consequently, POEM can result in GERD, although it is not clear that GERD occurs with greater frequency and severity after POEM than after surgical myotomy. To date, most published data on POEM have come from a relatively small number of highly specialized centers. The largest such single-center experience, involving 500 patients with achalasia, described no deaths, but there were adverse procedure-related events (including pneumothorax, bleeding, mucosal perforations and pleural effusions) in 3 percent of cases. Two months after POEM, there were significant reductions in symptom scores and LES pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, GERD symptoms at two months and at three years were noted in 17 and 21 percent of patients, respectively. Similar results have been described in other centers. Surprisingly good results for POEM also have been reported in patients with achalasia conditions that often do not respond well to conventional therapies such as type III (spastic) achalasia and &quot;end stage&quot; achalasia (markedly dilated, sigmoid esophagus), and in patients who have failed prior endoscopic and surgical achalasia treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. At this time, long-term data on the efficacy of POEM are very limited, and there are no randomized trials that compare POEM with the conventional achalasia treatments of laparoscopic surgical myotomy and pneumatic dilation. It is not clear that the excellent results reported by highly specialized centers can be duplicated by less experienced endoscopists, and there is controversy regarding the frequency and importance of the GERD that occurs after POEM. For all these reasons, the proper role of POEM in the treatment of achalasia remains disputed.

The symptoms and signs of achalasia are due primarily to failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options include mechanical disruption of the muscle fibers of the LES (eg, pneumatic dilation, surgical myotomy, or per-oral endoscopic myotomy) or biochemical reduction in LES pressure (eg, injection of botulinum toxin, oral nitrates, or calcium channel blockers). (See <a href=\"#H3680778\" class=\"local\">'Treatment approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumatic balloon dilation and surgical myotomy have comparable high success rates. However, the efficacy of both treatments decreases over time and approximately one-third to one-half of patients will require repeat treatment within 10 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although botulinum toxin has high initial success rates that are comparable to pneumatic dilation and surgery, patients treated with botulinum toxin have more frequent relapses and a shorter time to relapse. Medical therapy with nitrates and calcium channel blockers is often ineffective and is limited by side effects and tachyphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H3682960\" class=\"local\">'Pneumatic dilation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1988524\" class=\"local\">'Surgical myotomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3682212\" class=\"local\">'Botulinum toxin injection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3682306\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacological therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with achalasia, we suggest treatment with either pneumatic dilation or surgical myotomy rather than botulinum toxin injection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3681795\" class=\"local\">'Choice of treatment'</a> above.)<br/><br/>In most clinical settings, for healthy patients undergoing an invasive procedure for achalasia, we suggest choosing between pneumatic dilation using a progressive dilation protocol or minimally invasive surgical myotomy based upon local expertise in the procedures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In settings where there is equal expertise in both procedures, we suggest offering the patient detailed information on the risks and benefits for both procedures and having the patient choose. Surgical myotomy may be preferable in patients younger than 40 years of age due to an increased need for redilation in this age group. However, other experts, including other authors for UpToDate, disagree and would perform surgical myotomy as initial therapy for the majority of healthy patients. If local expertise in both procedures is lacking, we would refer patients to an esophageal center of excellence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumatic dilation and botulinum toxin injection for achalasia&quot;, section on 'Predictors of outcome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia#H3226516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical myotomy for achalasia&quot;, section on 'Surgical myotomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a promising new endoscopic technique for performing myotomy of the LES. Good results for POEM have been reported in patients with achalasia conditions that often do not respond well to conventional therapies such as type III (spastic) achalasia and &quot;end stage&quot; achalasia (markedly dilated, sigmoid esophagus), and in patients who have failed prior endoscopic and surgical achalasia treatments. However, long-term data on the efficacy of POEM are very limited, and there are no randomized trials that compare POEM with the conventional achalasia treatments of laparoscopic surgical myotomy and pneumatic dilation. Consequently, the role of POEM in the treatment of achalasia has not been established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are at high risk for complications (such as older adults), we suggest injection of botulinum toxin into the LES rather than a more invasive procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Pharmacologic therapy (eg, nitrates or calcium channel blockers) can be considered in patients who fail treatment with botulinum toxin. (See <a href=\"#H3682212\" class=\"local\">'Botulinum toxin injection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumatic dilation and botulinum toxin injection for achalasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3682306\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacological therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Vaezi MF, Pandolfino JE, Vela MF.
