An overview of the treatment of head and neck cancer is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8538936\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent disease and second primary malignancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for surveillance is that early detection of either a recurrence or a second primary tumor allows for appropriate treatment and better functional and survival outcomes. However, controlled prospective data demonstrating a survival benefit for any follow-up strategy do not exist. Therefore, retrospective data and observational studies are used to guide surveillance recommendations.</p><p>Whether early detection of recurrent disease alters outcomes is uncertain. Routine surveillance has been associated with a survival benefit in some observational studies when patients diagnosed at routine follow-up were compared with those who presented with symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, other studies have not observed a survival benefit from detecting asymptomatic recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. One explanation for the lack of a survival benefit may be the high proportion of recurrences that are symptomatic. Other studies suggest that survival in patients with recurrent disease is determined primarily by the extent of prior disease, its therapy and time to recurrence, and the location of the recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A randomized controlled trial of no meaningful follow-up versus surveillance after head and neck cancer treatment is impossible due to ethical considerations. </p><p>Posttreatment surveillance may be most effective in patients who initially had limited disease, thereby retaining an option for future curative therapy, such as those with early T stage (T1 and T2) tumors who received a single modality with either surgery or radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. In one report, 87 percent of those who survived two years or longer after salvage therapy had T1 or T2 index tumors, and only 30 percent had node-positive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Research suggests that patients who recur after treatment for early stage disease have better outcomes, especially when they are surgically salvageable and undergo adjuvant radiation or chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Despite high compliance with recommended surveillance, survival remains poor for patients who were previously treated for advanced stage disease or who initially presented with regional disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Decreasing morbidity by treating recurrent tumors and, thereby, providing palliation of symptoms is also an important goal and can often be accomplished by single- or multimodality therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8538948\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment-related complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although early detection of recurrences or second primary malignancies may not significantly improve survival, posttreatment surveillance also offers an opportunity to manage therapy-related complications (xerostomia, dental disease, hypothyroidism, osteoradionecrosis) and assess functional voice and swallowing rehabilitation, nutritional issues, ongoing alcohol and tobacco use, depression, and comorbid conditions. Furthermore, regular follow-up may provide important emotional and psychological support for patients and their families.

The following recommendations are consistent with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Our general approach is to see and examine patients every one to three months in the first year after treatment. In the second year, this is extended to every two to four months, in years 3 to 5, every four to six months, and after five years, every 12 months. Some practitioners stop seeing their patients at this time; however, we believe in lifelong surveillance.</p><p>In general, the intensity of follow-up is greatest in the first two to four years since approximately 80 to 90 percent of all recurrences after curative-intent treatment occur within this timeframe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Although proven benefit from more prolonged follow-up is lacking, surveillance beyond five years is generally recommended because late recurrences are occasionally observed and because the risk of a second primary malignancy remains elevated for at least 10 years after treatment of the index tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. This is especially true if patients continue to smoke and abuse alcohol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second primary malignancies in patients with head and neck cancers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be educated about possible signs and symptoms of tumor recurrence, including hoarseness, pain, dysphagia, bleeding, enlarged lymph nodes and other masses, cranial nerve deficits, weight loss, and difficulty breathing. Additional points that may be elicited in the interim history include otalgia (ear pain), hemoptysis, symptoms of aspiration, facial numbness, or symptoms due to cranial nerve involvement.</p><p>Recent illnesses (eg, pneumonia) or changes in overall health (eg, weight loss, chronic fatigue) may heighten suspicion of recurrent disease. In addition, fatigue, persistent lymphedema, or cold intolerance may suggest hypothyroidism. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8540514\"><span class=\"h3\">Counseling re: tobacco and alcohol use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tobacco smoking, when continued during and after therapy, decreases local control and survival, and increases the risk of second primary malignancy, in addition to its role as a major risk factor for head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Patients who continue to smoke and drink alcohol have worse local control and survival.</p><p>Tobacco smoking during therapy has been associated with an increased risk of cancer progression and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Tobacco cessation counseling, including pharmacologic intervention, is included as a quality of care measure by the American Head and Neck Society and should be included as part of routine follow-up visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Signs of tissue asymmetry should be specifically sought and any findings carefully evaluated. Examination of the ears should note serous or acute otitis media, which can indicate eustachian tube dysfunction by an obstructing nasopharyngeal mass. The anterior nasal cavity can be evaluated with a nasal speculum, but complete evaluation of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx requires rigid or fiberoptic endoscopy.</p><p>Inspection of the mouth should include careful visual examination and palpation of the mucous membranes, floor of the mouth, the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, palate, tonsillar fossae, buccal and gingival mucosa, and posterior pharyngeal wall. The dentition should be examined for signs of loose teeth, exposed bone, or osteoradionecrosis. Denture fit and any changes could also signify a malignant process. Additionally, tongue mobility and presence of trismus should be recorded. The structures within the oral cavity and oropharynx should be palpated, including the base of tongue and vallecula.</p><p>Fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy is indicated for most patients to evaluate the primary tumor site and search for second primary cancers. This minor procedure is really an extension of the head and neck exam and should be performed by a clinician who is skilled in the conduct of a proper head and neck examination. This is a rapidly performed office procedure, with or without local anesthesia, that causes only minor discomfort. This allows for a much more thorough examination of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and subglottis than is possible with an indirect mirror examination. Aside from mucosal irregularities, other abnormalities that should be specifically searched for are impaired vocal cord mobility, pooling of secretions, asymmetries, and bleeding. </p><p>Advances in optical technology, such as high definition images and narrow band imaging, may also help to detect early or subtle precancerous lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Some flexible endoscopes have working channels that will allow for biopsies to be taken in appropriate candidates.</p><p>Transnasal esophagoscopy can be carried out in patients with new symptoms such as dysphagia to evaluate the esophagus for carcinomas, strictures, and gastroesophageal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Second primary malignancies of the esophagus are significantly increased in patients with primary carcinogen-related squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, and these may be either synchronous or metachronous.

However, the role of screening asymptomatic individuals with various imaging procedures (eg, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], positron emission tomography [PET]) is controversial. Imaging procedures to screen for recurrence have not been rigorously studied and are, therefore, not routinely recommended. Some experts advocate imaging to screen patients felt to be at high risk of recurrence during the first several years. One retrospective analysis reported that PET scans at regular intervals beginning three to four months after treatment were highly sensitive for detecting locoregional or distant recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Since the median time to radiological recurrence was six months, some of these would be discovered with routine posttreatment imaging, and half would have been found with an additional scan. </p><p>While patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) related oropharyngeal cancer may have late or unusual sites of distant metastases, the rate remains low, and the value of detecting asymptomatic recurrences is unclear; thus, routine chest CT or PET is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging of the head and neck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients treated with definitive radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy, posttreatment reevaluation is performed by week 12 using CT, MRI, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PET scan.

If persistent or recurrent disease is suspected, then imaging is obtained sooner to allow for timely surgical salvage. Subsequent imaging is generally based upon the presence of signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>For patients with advanced cancer (N2 or N3 nodal disease) treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the role of PET-guided surveillance has been established in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

For such patients, radiographic evaluation should be individualized on a case-by-case basis. One example is the patient with a residual non-mucosal-based mass that is either PET negative or PET positive but biopsy negative. In addition, residual lymph nodes not treated with lymphadenectomy should be monitored by CT or MRI of the neck. The frequency of radiographic evaluation will depend on the clinical situation but is generally every 3 to 12 months for the first two to three years. </p><p>CT, MRI, PET, and ultrasonography have been used in posttreatment surveillance for locoregional recurrence. Each has its own merits, and the choice of imaging modality should be based on prior imaging, available radiologic expertise, and cost. CT and MRI are the mainstays of surveillance imaging. However, ultrasonography may be useful for directing a fine needle aspirate and has the benefit of lacking radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. PET scanning has become increasingly specific and is highly sensitive. As such, PET is becoming the preferred test for posttreatment screening at many institutions and may be used to detect local, regional, and distant disease before the development of signs and symptoms. However, PET scanning is quite costly and may lead to additional diagnostic evaluation for false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Special considerations surrounding posttreatment dental care are due to the adverse effects of radiation or chemoradiotherapy on the oral cavity and teeth, including xerostomia, demineralization, and hypovascularization of the maxilla and mandible, in addition to preexisting dental disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer#H722455156\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Dental issues'</a>.)</p><p>Dental cleaning and examination must be performed at least twice yearly. Patients who have their major salivary glands within radiation treatment fields have some degree of intermediate- to long-term salivary dysfunction, which contributes to dental decay. Those with teeth are at considerably higher risk of developing devastating dental complications. Patients should be instructed to perform careful oral hygiene and to take daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a> treatments according to the directions of their dentist. In those planning on undergoing major dental interventions, hyperbaric oxygen may be required to prevent severe complications such as osteoradionecrosis.</p><p>Postsurgical reconstruction and dental and facial implants are discussed separately.

This practice should be individualized based on patient disease and risk. Evidence of carotid atherosclerosis may also be apparent on panoramic radiographs obtained as part of routine dental examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>Obstructive sleep apnea is prevalent in head and neck cancer patients, with the incidence at least that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Although there is no evidence documenting a survival benefit in this population, early detection of a recurrence or second primary cancer may be associated with an improved prognosis in some patients. Furthermore, close follow-up allows the detection and management of treatment-related complications and other health problems.
