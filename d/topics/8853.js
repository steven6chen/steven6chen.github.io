Although this may be a reasonable practice in outbreak settings or in institutions that have a high rate of colonization or infection with drug-resistant bacteria, routine use of universal contact precautions is not yet supported by strong scientific evidence. Some observational studies have suggested a decrease in transmission rates of drug-resistant organisms with universal contact precautions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. However, a large cluster-randomized trial failed to demonstrate a statistically significant benefit of universal use of contact precaution measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. In this trial, 20 medical and surgical ICUs were randomly assigned to practice universal gown and glove use for all patients (intervention) or standard care with gown and glove use for only those patients known to be infected or colonized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (control). Overall, 26,180 patients were followed over the three-month baseline period prior to implementation of the intervention and the 10-month study period following it. Compliance with gown and glove use was high, ranging from 80 to 86 percent. The intervention did not reduce the primary combined endpoint of MRSA or VRE acquisitions compared with baseline rates to a greater extent than the control (reduction from 21.4 to 16.9 versus 19.0 to 16.3 acquisitions per 1000 patient days in the intervention and control groups, respectively). The intervention did reduce MRSA acquisitions by 2.98 acquisitions per 1000 patient days (95% CI 0.38-5.58) more than the control; however, the baseline rate of MRSA acquisition was higher in the intervention group, so acquisition rates at the end of the study period were comparable between the two groups. The effect on transmission of other drug-resistant organisms was not evaluated.</p><p>In the trial, universal gown and glove use led to one fewer healthcare personnel visits per patient on average, but there was no excess of adverse patient events with this practice. This is in contrast with earlier observational studies that had reported adverse effects associated with implementation of universal contact precautions (eg, increased rates of falls, pressure ulcers, dissatisfaction of patients with their treatment, and less documented care safety) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].

Of note, the reduction in bloodstream infections with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> use was greatest for coagulase-negative staphylococci and fungal infections; there was not a significant reduction in the incidence of central catheter-associated bloodstream infections involving gram-negative organisms, VRE, or MRSA.</p><p>A cluster randomized, crossover study including 9340 adults in intensive care units noted that daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> bathing did not reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. The primary outcome infection rate (a composite outcome of central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and <em>C. difficile</em> infections) was 2.86 per 1000 patient-days during the period of chlorhexidine bathing and 2.90 per 1000 patient-days during the control period (rate difference -0.04; 95% CI -1.10 to 1.01; p = 0.95). No differences between groups were noted with regard to secondary outcomes (eg, hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, blood culture contamination, or clinical cultures yielding multidrug-resistant organisms).

Compared with baseline preintervention rates, universal decolonization reduced both MRSA-positive clinical cultures and bloodstream infections due to any pathogen to a greater extent (hazard ratios [HRs] 0.63 and 0.56, respectively) than either screening and contact isolation alone (HRs 0.92 and 0.99, respectively) or targeted decolonization of carriers (HRs 0.75 and 0.78, respectively). The number of patients requiring decolonization to prevent one MRSA infection or one bloodstream infection was 181 or 54, respectively. The cost was approximately $40 per patient.</p><p>Certain limitations of this study should be noted. The universal decolonization group had a higher baseline rate of bloodstream infections than the other two groups, although the differences were not statistically significant. Additionally, the reduction in rates of bacteremia was greatest for coagulase-negative <em>Staphylococcus</em>.

About half of the patients included in this meta-analysis were from a large, multicenter, open-label, cluster-randomized trial of mechanically ventilated ICU patients in the Netherlands, in which SOD was performed with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a>, and amphotericin B, and SDD was performed with four days of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> in addition to tobramycin, colistin, and amphotericin B administered topically and through a nasogastric tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. The interventions did not substantially reduce crude 28-day mortality rates (26.6, 26.9, and 27.5 percent with SOD, SDD, and standard care, respectively) but were associated with a lower odds of mortality compared with standard care in adjusted analyses. In a subsequent analysis of that trial, SOD and SDD were also associated with decreased rates of bacteremia and respiratory tract colonization with highly resistant bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. In another large trial of ICU patients in the Netherlands that was intended to evaluate the rates of antimicrobial resistance with SOD versus SDD, mortality rates with the two interventions were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p>Despite the benefits, SDD has not found widespread favor in North America. The applicability of the efficacy results of the trials described above to other settings has been questioned because of the very low rates of antibiotic resistance in the Netherlands, where the largest trials were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/111,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,114</a>]. Another major reason for this reluctance to use SDD has been concern about promoting the growth of resistant bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/115-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">115-118</a>]. A large, multicenter, cluster-randomized, crossover trial of ICU patients in the Netherlands did not support this concern, but limitations of the study are substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. In that study, which used SOD and SDD regimens similar to the large trial described above, rates of rectal colonization with highly resistant bacteria were overall lower with SDD than SOD, despite a slightly greater increase over time in colonization with aminoglycoside resistant gram-negative bacilli with SDD than SOD. However, these results may not be generalizable to locations in which the burden of antibiotic resistance is greater than that in the Netherlands. In addition, there was no comparison group in which no selective decontamination was used, so the resistance rates without SOD or SDD are unknown.</p><p>SOD, SDD, and oropharyngeal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> have all been demonstrated to reduce rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia. These studies are discussed elsewhere.

The incidence and prevalence of isolation of multidrug-resistant bacteria (eg, MRSA, VRE, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) should be monitored, and these data should be disseminated to nurses and clinicians who work in the ICU through a form that is easy to interpret. It is useful to compare data from different time periods for one ICU and to compare different units within the same hospital. The United States National Healthcare Safety Network System also provides comparisons of rates among participating hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-and-antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-intensive-care-unit-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Comparing rates among different institutions helps to identify hospitals or units where problems persist and can help to gauge the efficacy of interventions aimed at controlling rates of endemic and epidemic resistant organisms.

This finding was surprising given that surveillance cultures identified a sizable subgroup of colonized patients who were not otherwise recognized.
