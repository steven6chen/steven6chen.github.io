However, chronic HCV infection is usually slowly progressive and may not result in clinically apparent liver disease in many patients. Approximately 5 to 30 percent of chronically infected individuals develop cirrhosis over a 20- to 30-year period of time. </p><p>In the United States, chronic HCV is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and the most frequent indication for liver transplantation.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features associated with chronic HCV infection and factors associated with the progression of chronic liver disease. Acute HCV infection and the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic HCV infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and evaluation of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9006660\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients with chronic HCV infection are minimally symptomatic, although fatigue is a common complaint. Even if cirrhosis develops, many patients have only nonspecific symptoms. Occasionally, patients have extrahepatic findings (such as cryoglobulinemia, renal disease, or specific dermatologic disorders) that are directly related to HCV infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with chronic infection are asymptomatic or have only mild nonspecific symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among those who have symptoms, the most frequent complaint is fatigue; other less common manifestations include nausea, anorexia, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, and weight loss. The symptoms are rarely incapacitating and may be difficult to ascribe to liver disease alone (rather than to another illness such as depression); nevertheless, they may lead to a decrease in the quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], which may in part be accounted for by awareness of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and which can be improved following successful treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H1317635295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Rationale for treatment'</a>.)</p><p>The symptoms of chronic HCV infection are not necessarily specific to the infection. One study, for example, evaluated a cohort of over 100 patients with chronic HCV infection and no clinical signs of cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Self-administered symptom scores were compared with those from 100 healthy blood donors without HCV. Fatigue was the most common complaint among both groups and occurred with similar frequency (62 percent in those with HCV versus 70 percent of controls). Abdominal pain, itching, and dark urine were the only complaints that were significantly more common among the HCV group, although they were present in only a small number of patients.</p><p>HCV infection has also been associated with cognitive impairment, which has been demonstrated in patients with HCV independent of the severity of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The mechanisms leading to the impairment are not well understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349504222\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrahepatic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of extrahepatic diseases have been associated with chronic HCV infection. Most cases appear to be directly related to the viral infection. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematologic diseases, such as essential mixed cryoglobulinemia and lymphoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal disease, particularly membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune disorders, such as thyroiditis and the presence of autoantibodies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermatologic conditions, such as porphyria cutanea tarda and lichen planus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p/><p>The frequency of such findings is uncertain, however they are not uncommon. In one series of 321 patients, at least one extrahepatic manifestation was observed in 38 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66842 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9007975\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum aminotransferases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is wide variability in serum aminotransferase levels among individual patients with chronic HCV infection over time. Up to one-third of patients have a normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Slight enzyme elevations are usually seen in the remaining patients; only about 25 percent have a serum ALT concentration more than twice normal, and it is rare to find elevations more than 10 times normal.</p><p>Occasionally, acute increases in the serum aminotransferases can occur during chronic HCV infection without apparent alternate cause. This phenomenon is not well defined, and so the incidence is difficult to assess. (See <a href=\"#H1210516694\" class=\"local\">'Acute exacerbation of chronic infection'</a> below.)</p><p>There is generally a poor correlation between aminotransferase levels and liver histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. As an example, a study of 90 patients with chronic HCV infection found no correlation between histologic findings and serum ALT values unless the ALT was elevated more than 10-fold; these marked elevations were associated with periportal inflammation and necrosis (so-called piecemeal necrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The mean values of aminotransferases were significantly lower among patients with chronic persistent hepatitis (minimal activity) than those with chronic active hepatitis (mild to moderate activity); however, overlap of values was considerable between the different histologic groups. Patients with normal serum ALT almost always show histologic evidence of chronic inflammation, although the degree of injury is typically minimal or mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/5,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,14</a>]. </p><p>Despite the lack of direct correlation between liver histology and serum ALT concentrations in chronic hepatitis C, aminotransferase levels have been incorporated into formulas that are used as noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests#H235753063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Overview of serologic and radiographic tests&quot;, section on 'Serologic tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349503631\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During chronic HCV infection (ie, following the acute phase), viral levels of HCV remain generally constant, although significant fluctuations can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. A retrospective study of 818 HCV-infected individuals, the majority of whom were also HIV-infected, evaluated changes in HCV viral levels checked over a mean of five and a half years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Variations in HCV viral load &gt;1 log occurred in 15 percent and variations &gt;0.5 log in 44 percent. Overall, the viral level has modest clinical significance. There is little correlation between HCV viral levels and serum aminotransferase levels or the severity of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. However, the viral level may influence the optimal duration of certain antiviral regimens. </p><p>The variables that affect viral levels are not well elucidated. Coinfections with other viruses have been observed to impact the serum levels of HCV RNA. HCV levels generally increase following HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. On the other hand, a persistent decline in HCV RNA replication can occur following acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Nevertheless, coinfection with either HIV or HBV is associated with a faster rate of fibrosis progression. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Host factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9007988\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other laboratory manifestations that can be observed in chronic HCV infection include those that are related to the potential extrahepatic manifestations of HCV. As examples, low platelets may reflect immune-mediated thrombocytopenia; a reactive rheumatoid factor, an increased production of autoantibodies; and proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microscopic hematuria, glomerulonephritis. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9006832\"><span class=\"h2\">Findings in cirrhosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 5 to 30 percent of chronically infected individuals develop cirrhosis over a 20- to 30-year period of time, although slower and faster rates of progression have been described (see <a href=\"#H2080829280\" class=\"local\">'Risk and rate of progression to cirrhosis'</a> below). The development of cirrhosis is silent in the majority of patients in whom it occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although these patients tend to be more symptomatic than those with chronic hepatitis alone, no clinical symptom, physical sign, or laboratory test is either sensitive or very specific for the diagnosis. The physical examination may reveal hepatomegaly (68 percent in one series) or splenomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In our experience, however, most patients with cirrhosis do not have hepatomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H71302968\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Symptoms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory testing can be helpful in identifying cirrhosis in HCV-infected patients, but none are 100 percent specific. Suggestive findings include an elevation in the serum bilirubin concentration, hypoalbuminemia, or a decrease in the platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

Nevertheless, an elevated serum AFP concentration requires imaging of the liver to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma. Serial testing for several months is warranted if the imaging studies are negative, since rising levels may be indicative of an occult malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma and recommendations for surveillance in adults with chronic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients who acquire HCV do not spontaneously clear the virus and thus develop chronic HCV infection. Chronic infection results in liver fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis in a subset of patients, although the rate of disease progression is variable. Patients who develop cirrhosis are at further risk for complicating events (such as variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and encephalopathy) and hepatocellular carcinoma, although many patients with compensated cirrhosis remain stable for years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F99947\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99947 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9007496\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of chronic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of chronic infection after HCV acquisition is high. In most studies, 50 to 85 percent of patients chronically remain HCV RNA positive following infection and seroconversion, depending on the population and the source of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F99947\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99947 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Of those who are able to spontaneously clear HCV, most do so within 12 weeks of seroconversion, although spontaneous clearance after a longer period of follow-up has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

This can contribute to viral persistence, as the viral diversity allows HCV to escape immune recognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-c-virus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of the hepatitis C virus&quot;, section on 'Viral heterogeneity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9007615\"><span class=\"h3\">Host predictors of risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Host factors may also be involved in the ability to spontaneously clear the virus. One of the most influential factors appears to be certain polymorphisms of a chromosomal locus close to the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In one report of 1008 patients, the presence of the favorable <span class=\"nowrap\">(C/C</span> type) allele at this locus was associated with clearance rates of approximately 50 to 55 percent compared with only 16 to 20 percent in patients with the unfavorable <span class=\"nowrap\">(T/T</span> type) allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The favorable alleles were more common in patients of European ancestry compared with those of African ancestry. A second study that included 284 patients with chronic HCV infection and 69 patients who had spontaneously cleared the virus found that the favorable allele was present in 73 percent of patients who spontaneously cleared the virus, compared with 46 percent of patients with persistent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These polymorphisms are also an important predictor of response during treatment with peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>.</p><p>Black individuals are less likely than white individuals to have the favorable allele, and data suggest they may be less likely to spontaneously clear the virus. In a population-based study, 9 percent of blacks and 27 percent of whites where anti-HCV positive and HCV RNA negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, a limitation of the study is that information on which patients received treatment was not available, so these numbers likely overestimate the rate of spontaneous clearance.</p><p>Other factors that have been associated with a higher likelihood of spontaneous clearance include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of specific HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High titers of neutralizing antibodies against HCV structural proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Host neutralizing responses that target viral entry after HCV binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The persistence of an HCV-specific CD4 T-cell response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White patients with relatively low peak levels of HCV viremia during acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210516694\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute exacerbation of chronic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute exacerbation of chronic HCV infection, with a significant elevation of serum aminotransferase levels over the baseline level in the absence of other potential causes of acute hepatitis, can occur. However, this phenomenon is not well characterized, and there are no standard definitions for it. Thus, its true incidence is unknown. Widely fluctuating aminotransferases were reported frequently in early studies on HCV, with an approximate incidence of ten percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In a study from Italy of 82 patients with chronic HCV infection who were identified as having a symptomatic five-fold or greater increase in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level over baseline without an alternative cause of acute hepatitis, ALT levels returned towards baseline within five months in the majority, but some patients had recurrent flares and others had persistent elevation of the ALT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Genotype 2 infection was present in 46 percent, disproportionately greater than the historically estimated prevalence of 20 percent for that genotype in Italy. An earlier study from Italy had also suggested an association of genotype 2 with acute exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Presumptive acute exacerbations of chronic HCV have also been described following receipt of immunosuppressive agents. In a retrospective study of 308 patients with cancer and chronic HCV infection, 11 percent were identified as having a three-fold or greater increase in the baseline ALT level without an alternative explanation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Presence of a hematologic tumor and receipt of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> were independently associated with such an ALT increase. However, drug induced hepatotoxicity could not be ruled out. </p><p>Such increases in the aminotransferase levels may be associated with more rapid progression of liver disease. Among 23 of the 82 patients in the case series from Italy who underwent paired liver biopsies, a greater proportion had progression of fibrosis and inflammation over time (78 and 61 percent, respectively) compared with an age-, sex-, and genotype-matched control group who did not experience an increase in the ALT level (39 and 10 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2080829280\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk and rate of progression to cirrhosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of chronic HCV infection has been difficult to clearly define because of the long course of the disease, the difficulty in measuring precise duration of infection, and other factors that can affect disease course.

In patients with chronic HCV infection, jaundice is almost always a sign of advanced liver disease. Almost all HCV-infected patients who develop these complications have cirrhosis; however, not all patients with cirrhosis develop these complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/27,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,68,69</a>]. A study of 384 patients with compensated cirrhosis due to HCV found that the risk of developing hepatic decompensation was 3.9 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The most common events were CTP score &ge;7 and <span class=\"nowrap\">definite/presumed</span> hepatocellular carcinoma; the other outcomes were variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, liver transplantation, or death. Clinical outcomes were more common among patients with cirrhosis compared with those with advanced fibrosis (7.5 versus 3.3 percent per year). Once a patient developed a CTP score &ge;7, the rate of subsequent clinical events increased to 12.9 percent per year with a mortality rate of 10 percent per year.</p><p>Once complications of cirrhosis have occurred, liver transplantation is the only effective therapy. Recurrent HCV infection of the graft occurs in almost all patients, although the long-term survival after transplantation for HCV is similar to that for other causes of hepatic failure (60 to 80 percent).

There is also suggestive experimental evidence that HCV infection itself can promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Mice that were made transgenic for the HCV core gene developed adenomas and subsequent carcinoma within the adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

In 2007 in the United States, the age-adjusted mortality rate among patients with HCV infection was 4.6 per 100,000 persons per year, a rate that was higher than that seen for HIV (4.2 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. An estimated 8,000 to 13,000 deaths occur each year in the United States from chronic HCV infection. </p><p>Compared to uninfected patients, patients with chronic HCV infection are more likely to die at a younger age and, as expected, from liver-related causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>]. In the report above of HCV-associated mortality in the United States, 73 percent of the deaths were in patients between the ages of 45 and 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Similarly, in an analysis of death records in New York City from 2000 to 2011, the median age at death of over 13,000 individuals with HCV infection was 60 years, compared with 78 years among over 600,000 individuals without HCV or HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. HCV-infected individuals were more likely to have died from liver cancer (OR 9.2), drug-related causes (OR 4.3), and cirrhosis (OR 3.7), compared with uninfected individuals.</p><p>Mortality increases with progression of liver disease. In the large prospective Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) trial, which included 1050 patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who were followed for a median of 5.7 years, 122 patients (12 percent) died and an additional 74 patients (7 percent) underwent liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The majority of deaths (62 percent) were attributed to liver-related causes. The mortality rate was higher among patients with cirrhosis compared with those who had advanced fibrosis (14 versus 7 percent). In a series of 384 patients with compensated cirrhosis, the 3, 5, and 10-year survival rates were 96, 91, and 79 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Once decompensated cirrhosis occurred, the five-year survival fell to 50 percent. Other studies have found similarly low survival rates following a diagnosis of decompensated HCV-related cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. Survival may also be worse in patients who develop cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Causes of death among patients with HCV are not always related to liver disease and may vary based upon the age group being examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/74,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,78,79</a>]. As an example, in a population study from Denmark, the primary cause of death among patients with HCV aged 20 to 39 years was unnatural (reported as death due to mental and behavioral disorders related to psychoactive substance use and death resulting from external causes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The 10-year risk of unnatural death in patients with HCV between the ages of 20 and 29 years was 13 percent. In patients between the ages of 40 and 59 years, deaths were equally distributed between liver-related, non-liver-related, and unnatural causes. In patients 70 years of age or older with HCV, the most common causes of death were non-liver related. Patients with HCV were at increased risk of death compared with non-HCV-infected individuals at all ages, ranging from an 18-fold increase for 20 to 29 year-olds, to a 1.6-fold increase for patients aged 70 years or greater.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors appear to be important determinants of fibrosis progression in individual HCV-infected patients, including baseline liver histology, age, ethnic background, gender, alcohol use, comorbidities such as obesity or viral coinfection, and HCV-specific cellular immune response. As examples, young women and children infected with HCV tend to have slower rates of fibrosis progression. However, even in a relatively homogeneous population such as in a study of Irish women who received contaminated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], the outcome is not uniform, suggesting that unexplained factors influence the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349503874\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best clinical predictor of future disease progression in chronic HCV infection is the amount of baseline inflammation and fibrosis on liver biopsy or by noninvasive measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].

As an example, in a meta-analysis of 16 studies that included more than 15,000 HCV-infected patients, heavy alcohol use (&gt;240 to 560 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/week)</span> was associated with a higher risk of cirrhosis (compensated or decompensated) compared with less heavy use (relative risk 2.33, 95% CI 1.67-3.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Similarly, in another seminal study, daily consumption of 50 g or more of alcohol was associated with a 34 percent increase in the rate of fibrosis progression. A standard drink contains 12 g of alcohol and is equivalent to 360 mL (12 oz) of beer, 150 mL (5 oz) of wine, and 45 mL (1.5 oz) of whiskey or other 80-proof distilled spirits. </p><p>It is uncertain whether light or moderate intake of alcohol increases the risk of progression of liver disease in HCV infection, as data are limited and some, but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/122,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,123</a>], studies have found an association. </p><p>These observations probably explain the epidemiologic reports of a high prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in patients with alcohol use disorder and either cirrhosis or liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>].

This suggests a cohort effect (ie, patients infected with genotype 1b having had disease for longer amounts of time).</p><p>Another observation is that the disease may be accelerated in patients who are infected by more than one HCV genotype, suggesting that coinfection may have an additive or synergistic harmful effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/96,136\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,136</a>]. Acute exacerbations of chronic HCV infection, the causes of which are unknown, may also be associated with more rapid fibrosis progression. (See <a href=\"#H1210516694\" class=\"local\">'Acute exacerbation of chronic infection'</a> above.)</p><p>Similarly, coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV may also result in more rapid disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/137-139\" class=\"abstract_t\">137-139</a>]. The significance of HBV and HCV coinfection may be underestimated since many coinfected patients lack serologic markers of HBV infection. This was illustrated in a study in which 33 percent of 200 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative HCV-infected patients had detectable HBV DNA, in contrast to 14 percent of 50 HCV-uninfected controls with liver disease and negative HBsAg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>]. The reason why some patients with HCV who are infected with HBV lack HBsAg is unknown. While some of these patients have hepatitis B core antibodies, in others, all markers are absent. The lack of HBsAg does not appear to be related to mutations within the gene encoding for the region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].

Even if cirrhosis develops, many patients have only nonspecific symptoms. Some patients have extrahepatic findings (such as cryoglobulinemia, renal disease, or specific dermatologic disorders) that are directly related to HCV infection. (See <a href=\"#H9006660\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is wide variability in serum aminotransferase levels in patients with chronic HCV infection over time. Up to one-third of patients have normal levels. Occasionally, acute increases in the serum aminotransferases can occur during chronic HCV infection without apparent alternate cause. HCV RNA levels generally remain constant during chronic infection with &lt;1 log fluctuations. (See <a href=\"#H9007975\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following acquisition of HCV, 50 to 85 percent of patients remain chronically infected. Of those, approximately 5 to 30 percent develop cirrhosis over the subsequent 20 to 30 years, although slower and faster rates of fibrosis progression have been described. Patients who develop cirrhosis are at further risk for complicating events (such as variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and encephalopathy) and hepatocellular carcinoma, although many patients with compensated cirrhosis remain stable for years. Overall survival is decreased in patients with chronic HCV infection, especially in those who have developed cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baseline level of liver fibrosis is an important clinical predictor of further fibrosis progression. Patients with no fibrosis and minimal hepatic inflammation have a very low risk of progressing to cirrhosis. Once an individual has developed advanced fibrosis (ie, bridging fibrosis or METAVIR stage F3), the risk of progression to cirrhosis is approximately 10 percent per year. (See <a href=\"#H349503874\" class=\"local\">'Liver histology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Host factors that appear to be adversely associated with fibrosis progression in individual HCV-infected patients are older age, male gender, non-black race, alcohol use, and comorbidities such as obesity or viral coinfection. The impact of viral factors (such as genotype or diversity) is less evident. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Factors associated with disease progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although elevations in the serum aminotransferase levels have been observed in patients with chronic HCV infection with the use of immunosuppressive medications, it is uncertain whether this affects fibrosis progression. However, certain immunocompromised populations, such as HIV-coinfected and liver transplant patients, have accelerated fibrosis rates.
