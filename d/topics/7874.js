In most instances, GTPS is due to a gluteus medius or minimus tendinopathy, with variable involvement of the regional bursae.</p><p>Historically, the term &ldquo;trochanteric bursitis&rdquo; was used to describe any pain around the lateral hip. However, advanced imaging and histopathological studies have shown that involvement of the trochanteric bursae in patients with lateral hip pain is uncommon and, when present, exists as a secondary or associated finding. Thus, trochanteric bursitis is a misnomer when it used to describe all causes of lateral hip pain. In fact, primary trochanteric bursitis is rare and is typically of microbial etiology.</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of GTPS are reviewed here. An overview of bursitis and the musculoskeletal examination of the hip and groin are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal examination of the hip and groin&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285296604\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is common. The best estimates of prevalence are from a large, community-based study with over 3000 adults aged 50 to 70 years, in which unilateral GTPS was present in 15 percent of women and 6.6 percent of men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Bilateral GTPS was reported in 8.5 and 1.9 percent of women and men, respectively. The usual age at presentation is over 50 years, and the female to male ratio is approximately 4:1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285296715\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) include female gender, obesity, knee pain, iliotibial band tenderness, and low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other conditions associated with GTPS include scoliosis; a leg length discrepancy; articular conditions of the hip, knee, and foot; and painful foot disorders such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy, a bunion, a Morton&rsquo;s neuroma, or a callus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83922635\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOPATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a repetitive overload tendinopathy of the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, which play a primary role in hip abduction and pelvic stabilization in walking, running, and standing on one leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The high rate of tendinopathy, partial tendon rupture, and entheseal damage, plus the risk factors described above (see <a href=\"#H285296715\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above), all suggest that mechanically induced tissue failure is a key feature of GTPS.</p><p>The pathogenetic role of regional bursae in GTPS has been a matter of debate. One study attempted to clarify the role of bursa versus tendon pathology in patients with GTPS by comparing biopsies of tendon and bursa from 34 patients undergoing surgery for refractory GTPS with those of 29 controls undergoing total hip replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A higher concentration of substance P was found in trochanteric bursa, but not in tendon, of patients with GTPS compared with tendon and bursa tissue in controls. However, it is not known whether these findings apply to the more common, milder forms of GTPS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88479065\"><span class=\"h1\">RELEVANT ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The greater trochanteric and peritrochanteric tissues have been viewed as analogous to the greater tubercle and rotator cuff tendons of the shoulder. Similar to rotator cuff tendinopathy in the shoulder, greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a derangement of the hip abductor and rotator muscles gluteus medius and minimus near their trochanteric enthesis (site of insertion of ligament or tendon into bone) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98484 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows that GTPS ranges in severity from edema at the enthesis and tendinopathy to tendon rupture and avulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Tears of gluteus medius and minimus result in compensatory tensor fascia lata hypertrophy, as this muscle takes a greater share of the abductor load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The iliotibial band (or tract) is a reinforcement of the deep fascia that extends from the iliac crest to the lateral tibial (Gerdy&rsquo;s) tubercle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70825 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Near its origin, the iliotibial band is tightly apposed to the greater trochanter, and contracture of the iliotibial band may contribute to GTPS.</p><p>Several bursae present in the trochanteric region may react to tendon damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The trochanteric bursae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F98881\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98881 \">figure 3</a>) and a more distal gluteofemoral bursa lie beneath the iliotibial band and gluteus maximus, over the greater trochanter. The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus bursae lie between these tendons and the greater trochanter. More detailed information on the anatomy and biomechanics of the hip can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin#H517329936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal examination of the hip and groin&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88479565\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no established diagnostic criteria for greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). We diagnose GTPS in patients with the following symptoms and signs, in whom another condition to explain the findings is not present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of lateral hip pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain when lying upon the affected side</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local tenderness to palpation of the greater trochanter, most marked at its superoposterior facet (posterior corner)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88479541\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key complaint in patients with GTPS is lateral hip pain near the greater trochanter. Pain increases with ambulation, prolonged standing, upright activity, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, ascending inclines, and with direct pressure when lying on the painful side.</p><p>The most useful clinical question when evaluating patients with hip pain is to ask patients to &ldquo;point to where the pain is.&rdquo; Patients with GTPS and its rare mimickers point to the lateral hip, whereas those with intraarticular hip disease point to the groin and the anteromedial thigh.</p><p>In the author&rsquo;s experience, GTPS can also result in fatigue and general malaise when it interferes with sleep, which further exacerbate the pain. GTPS has been shown to negatively impact quality of life, with a detrimental effect similar to that of end-stage hip osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83922647\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of patients with lateral hip pain should include attention to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation of how the patient walks into the room, sits, rises from the chair, and removes shoes and socks. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An antalgic limp and an inability to handle shoes and socks suggest hip joint disease rather than GTPS, although both conditions may coexist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A waddling gait, known as Trendelenburg gait, in which the body shifts to the affected side during the stance phase of gait, may be observed in both hip joint disease and GTPS. A positive Trendelenburg test may also be positive in both conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67453 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenderness to palpation of the greater trochanter is the key physical examination finding of GTPS. With the patient lying on his or her unaffected side, the examiner palpates the greater trochanter and the peritrochanteric region. In patients with GTPS, there is typically direct tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter. Tenderness is maximal in the superoposterior facet, or posterior corner, of the greater trochanter. This site corresponds to one of the insertions of gluteus medius, with the other being on the lateral facet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F99774\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99774 \">figure 5</a>). A tissue bulge is a red flag that should be evaluated with an ultrasound (US) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of physical examination maneuvers can be performed to confirm suspected GTPS and distinguish it from other conditions that could have caused or contributed to GTPS. These include iliotibial band tenderness; obesity; scoliosis; a leg length discrepancy; arthritis of the hip, knee, and foot; and painful foot disorders such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy, a bunion, Morton neuroma, or a callus. (See <a href=\"#H285296715\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H61276808\" class=\"local\">'Specific manuevers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61276808\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific manuevers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many instances, patients with GTPS also present with additional symptoms such as pain in the groin or radiating down the thigh, which can make the diagnosis more difficult. Thus, additional maneuvers are sometimes needed to confirm the presence GTPS, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to distinguish it from concomitant conditions or its mimickers. (See <a href=\"#H285296231\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>When performing specific maneuvers to evaluate the hip, there are two key principles that help distinguish muscle-tendon pain from joint pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain associated with muscle-tendon unit pathology is elicited by active, and in particular resisted motion, or by stretching.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain associated with joint pathology is usually elicited by passive motion, which is often restricted.</p><p/><p>We present several maneuvers which help confirm the presence of a gluteus medius or minimus tendinopathy from GTPS below. They are presented in order of decreasing utility, based upon our clinical experience as well as limited available evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/2,3,5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Standing on one leg for 30 seconds</strong> &ndash; The patient is asked to stand on the painful leg for 30 seconds. Trochanteric pain during this time period indicates gluteus medius tendinopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The resisted external derotation test</strong> &ndash; With the patient supine, the hip and knee on the affected side are both flexed 90 degrees, and then the hip is externally rotated. From this position, the patient is asked to rotate the thigh back to a neutral position while the examiner opposes this motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F99222\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99222 \">picture 1</a>). Trochanteric pain during resisted &ldquo;derotation&rdquo; of the externally rotated thigh (or resisted internal rotation of the hip) indicates a gluteus medius tendinopathy in patients with GTPS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trendelenburg sign</strong> &ndash; The patient is instructed to stand on the affected leg and then walk. The test is positive in patients with a downward tilt of the pelvis when stepping on the affected side, which indicates weakness of the hip abductors, in particular gluteus medius and minimus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67453 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resisted abduction </strong>&ndash; The patient lies supine with the affected hip abducted 45 degrees. The test is positive if the trochanteric pain is triggered by resisted active abduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The FABER test</strong> &ndash; The FABER (flexion-abduction-external rotation) test, or Patrick test, may elicit lateral hip pain in patients with GTPS by stretching the portion of the gluteus medius that rotates the hip medially. With the patient supine, the examiner lifts the knee on the affected side (hip flexion), places the heel next to the opposite knee, and lets the knee fall to the side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F99775\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99775 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The FABER test is used in various conditions, and is only useful when the patient is first asked to &ldquo;point where the pain is&rdquo; and the FABER test reproduces the pain. Pain in the lateral hip supports GTPS, pain in the groin suggests hip joint disease, and pain in the buttock suggests sacroiliac joint disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin#H78200702\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal examination of the hip and groin&quot;, section on 'Tests for lateral hip pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Additional maneuvers that can help identify specific factors contributing to GTPS that can be addressed in patients with persistent symptoms include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leg length measurement</strong> &ndash; Gross leg length inequality (&gt;2 cm difference) may contribute to GTPS. Since are many ways of measuring leg length, we suggest that the clinician adhere to one approach and acquire practice in patients with and without leg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spinal deformities. Leg length discrepancy can be evaluated by standing behind the patient, placing the hands over the iliac crests, and estimating if they are level. This is the author&rsquo;s preferred method of leg length measurement. Another approach is to use measuring tape held with one hand on the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the other hand on the tip of the medial malleolus. The tape measurement method is relatively accurate in measuring leg length discrepancy and shows excellent agreement when compared with computed tomography (CT) scans of the lower limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Radiography is the gold standard for measurement for measurement, but is usually unnecessary. Full-limb radiographs are inexpensive, accurate, and cause little radiation exposure. The measurement spans from the center of the femoral head to the distalmost point of the tibia (ie, the medial malleolus).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The Ober test</strong> &ndash; The Ober test detects contracture or tightness of the iliotibial band and attached muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70825 \">figure 2</a>), which can contribute to GTPS by creating excessive pressure on the lateral prominence of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iliotibial-band-syndrome#H296524758\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iliotibial band syndrome&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>). The author suggests performing this maneuver in patients whose symptoms are refractory to initial therapy. While the Ober test is negative in most patients with GTPS, a contributing role of the iliotibial band in this syndrome has been shown by epidemiologic and echographic data (see <a href=\"#H285296604\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H285296531\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> below). The author performs the Ober maneuver in three steps:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With the patient on their unaffected side, and hips and knees flexed 45 degrees, the upper thigh is raised about 30 degrees, brought back in line with the trunk, and passively brought down toward the examination table. A failure to reach the table, a pelvic tilt, or both, indicate iliotibial band <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gluteus medius contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With the patient still on their unaffected side, legs now fully extended, the upper leg is passively brought down behind the lower leg to detect tensor fascia lata contracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With the upper leg in extension, the leg is then passively brought in front of the unaffected leg to detect gluteus maximus contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285296505\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies are suggested when the diagnosis of GTPS is unclear, there is concern for another underlying pathology, or to evaluate cases unresponsive to initial therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285296511\"><span class=\"h3\">Conventional radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standing anteroposterior view of the pelvis should be obtained in all patients to rule out concurrent hip osteoarthritis and other pathology such as femoroacetabular impingement, osteonecrosis or a femoral neck fracture. In GTPS, contour irregularities larger than 2 mm in the superolateral greater trochanter suggest abductor tendon MRI abnormalities, including peritendinous edema of gluteus medius [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285296531\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If available, US should be performed in all patients with GTPS. US can identify the culprit tendon lesion as well as distended bursae. As an example, a retrospective review of US examinations in 877 GTPS patients revealed gluteus medius tendinosis in 236 patients, gluteus minimus tendinosis in 143 patients, and tendinosis of both muscles in 59 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thickening of the iliotibial band was noted in 250 patients with GTPS.

Hip joint disease and GTPS may also coexist. One way to distinguish GTPS from hip joint disease is to bring the hip passively through flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation with the hip flexed 90 degrees. Restriction of motion, and endpoint pain, would suggest hip joint disease. The FABER (flexion-abduction-external rotation) test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F99775\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99775 \">picture 2</a>) would be positive in both conditions, and thus inconclusive. In such a patient, a diagnosis of GTPS relies largely on palpation and the response to a trochanteric anesthetic blockade. Identifying GTPS in a patient with hip osteoarthritis is not inconsequential and may help with pain management.

Pain is felt in the groin or in an area, often braced by the patient between index finger and thumb, proximal to the greater trochanter. Distinguishing features of FAI include limited flexion or internal rotation of the hip, and groin pain when the hip is flexed 90 degrees, adducted, and internally rotated (FADDIR test) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98467\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98467 \">picture 3</a>).

Intraarticular snapping can also occur from pathology within the hip joint. Patients may seek medical attention due to the snapping or the trochanteric pain, and if the snapping is not mentioned by the patient the condition may be diagnosed as GTPS.

Further evaluation of these patients should be guided by a surgical oncologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Piriformis syndrome</strong> &ndash; In piriformis syndrome, the sciatic nerve is compressed beneath, or across, piriformis muscle. The condition features buttock pain, tingling, and numbness, plus pain shooting down the posterior thigh and into the leg. The tender area in piriformis syndrome is dorsal to the greater trochanter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Compression/trauma in the sciatic notch/gluteal region'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iliolumbar ligament strain </strong>&ndash; Iliolumbar ligament strain is a pain syndrome which may involve the trochanteric region and occurs with stretching a damaged iliolumbar ligament. Pain is reproduced when the trunk is bent to the contralateral side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lumbar deep somatic pain radiation </strong>&ndash; Lumbar pain from lumbar facet joint osteoarthritis may radiate to the buttock, trochanteric region, posterior thigh, and sometimes leg without reaching the foot. The trochanteric pain distribution may lead to confusion with GTPS. In lumbar facet joint osteoarthritis, however, the pain is usually triggered by backward bending of the lumbar spine. Pain with a similar distribution to that of lumbar facet osteoarthritis is common in severe spondylolisthesis. However, pain from spondylolisthesis usually occurs on forward flexion, which is limited by rock-hard tightening of the hamstring muscles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Conversely, pain from GTPS may be erroneously attributed to the lumbar spine. This was demonstrated by a study in which 20 percent of 247 patients referred for evaluation to a spine center had GTPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Several of these patients, who were predominantly women, had undergone failed spinal surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sacroiliac disease </strong>&ndash; In sacroiliitis, the pain radiates to the buttock, posterior thigh, and trochanteric region. However, it may be distinguished from GTPS in that sacroiliac pain is typically nocturnal and improves upon arising. Sacroiliitis may also occasionally cause sciatica, which may alternate sides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

For some, pseudo-sciatica implies a dull, deeply felt, poorly localized pain that radiates down the lower extremity in a non-dermatomal distribution. This deep somatic pain occurs in iliolumbar ligament strain, facet joint osteoarthritis, spondylolisthesis, sacroiliitis, and GTPS. In GTPS, pain extends straight down in the lateral thigh and leg (following the iliotibial band), whereas in other conditions it is felt posteriorly in the lower lumbar region, buttock, trochanteric region, and back of thigh. For other clinicians, pseudo-sciatica follows the characteristic sciatic nerve distribution, although paresthesiae and areflexia are thought to be rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Thus, the pre-rash stage of herpes zoster should be considered in the patient describing a segmental burning pain in the region of the greater trochanter.

Because a lateral branch of this nerve innervates the skin in the lateral hip, confusion with GTPS may arise. The iliohypogastric nerve (L1), which may be damaged by lower abdomen incisions and laparoscopy, also has a cutaneous branch that reaches the lateral hip and may therefore lead to the same confusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Damage to the ilioinguinal (L1) and genitofemoral (L1,2) nerves causes inguinal pain that may superficially resemble hip disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Finally, the lateral femorocutaneous nerve (L2,3) exits the pelvis medial to the anterior superior iliac spine in its way to the skin in the anterolateral thigh. This nerve is frequently compressed by a heavy, tense, and prominent abdomen, such as in ascites and pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], as well as by external pressure. This common neuropathy, known as meralgia paresthetica, has led to confusion with GTPS. These various neuropathies manifest burning pain, paresthesias, and hypesthesia.

This may be suspected when the lateral hip tenderness is disproportionately intense on one side. GTPS may be detected by the &ldquo;standing on one leg for 30 seconds&rdquo; maneuver and the resisted external derotation test, which lead the patient&rsquo;s attention away from the greater trochanter (see <a href=\"#H61276808\" class=\"local\">'Specific manuevers'</a> above). These should be performed bilaterally without asking leading questions.

The author prefers using a 22 gauge, 1.5-inch needle.</p><p>With the patient lying on the unaffected side, the greater trochanter is identified by proximal palpation along the femur. The point of maximal tenderness is usually the posterior corner, which corresponds to the superoposterior facet, of the greater trochanter. The needle is inserted vertically to periosteal contact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F99447\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99447 \">picture 4</a>).

Although bleeding or infection would be an extremely rare complication of the procedure, patients should be asked to report any swelling and tenderness developing at the site of infiltration.</p><p>There are few data on the efficacy of glucocorticoid injections in GTPS. Injections given under US guidance within the trochanteric bursa may be more effective than those given in the gluteus medius bursa, which suggests a pathogenetic role of both gluteus medius and iliotibial band [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].
