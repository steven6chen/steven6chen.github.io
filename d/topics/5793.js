These may be normal rate, bradycardic, or tachycardic, and may occur as single beats or sustained. Some ventricular arrhythmias may be present as sudden cardiac arrest. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">PREMATURE VENTRICULAR CONTRACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While they have many names, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), ventricular premature beats (VPBs), ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), premature ventricular beats (PVBs), or ventricular extrasystoles (VES) are early occurring, widened QRS complexes originating from the left or right ventricle that have a distinct morphology (resembling neither a typical left nor right bundle branch block) that is markedly different from the sinus QRS complex. Unifocal PVCs all have a single morphology. Multiple different QRS morphologies are termed multiform PVCs.</p><p>In general, there is no P wave identified before a premature QRS complex. However, there may be a normal sinus P wave present if the PVC is very late; in this situation, there is a long coupling interval (from the prior QRS complex), the P wave is not conducted, and the PR interval is shorter than the native sinus beat.</p><p>The QRS complex of a PVC is widened, often notched, and with a QRS duration usually &gt;0.16 seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57511\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57511 \">waveform 1</a>). It will have a morphology that resembles a right or left bundle branch block depending upon the location of origin, but its morphology is generally not the same as a typical bundle branch block. It is assumed that the PVC originates in the left ventricle when it has a positive deflection or tall R wave in V1 (right bundle branch block configuration), while a negative complex with a deep S wave in V1 (resembling a left bundle branch block morphology) originates in the right ventricle. Other findings on the electrocardiogram (ECG) include marked repolarization abnormalities, manifested as ST segment and T wave abnormalities. Retrograde activation of the atrium is variably present; it depends upon the location of the premature beat, the time necessary for impulse conduction to the atrioventricular (AV) node, the coupling interval to the prior sinus beat, and the ability of the node to conduct retrograde to the atrium. When present, there is a retrograde P wave, usually seen within or slightly before the T wave. The interval from the previous P wave to the retrograde P wave is, however, shorter than the underlying sinus PP interval, reflecting the premature activation of the atrium. This retrograde P wave is usually negative in leads II, III, and aVF. </p><p>There can be many sinus node responses to a PVC. Most commonly, a full compensatory pause follows the PVC; thus, the RR interval between the QRS complexes before and after the premature beat is twice the RR interval between two successive sinus beats. The pause is due to retrograde AV nodal penetration of the PVC, which causes the AV node to be refractory to the next on-time sinus impulse, which is blocked. The subsequent sinus impulse does conduct through the AV node to stimulate the ventricle. In this situation, a normal appearing P wave may be seen, often buried in the ST segment or T wave of the PVC, with no QRS following it. Other cases may have retrograde activation of the atrium with an inverted P wave in the inferior leads and resultant delay of sinus node impulse generation. In this situation, the RR interval between the QRS complex before and after the PVC may be less than two sinus beats. </p><p>On occasion, the PVC may be interpolated. It occurs between two normal sinus QRS complexes, and the PP interval between the QRS complex prior to and after the premature beat is the same as the underlying sinus PP interval, due to lack of retrograde penetration into the AV node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72768\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72768 \">waveform 2</a>). If the ventricular myocardium is no longer refractory from the PVC, it is capable of again being stimulated from the next sinus beat. There also may be concealed retrograde conduction of the PVC into the AV node, rendering it partially refractory and leading to a longer PR interval of the first sinus beat following the premature complex. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular bigeminy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular bigeminy is present when a premature ventricular complex follows every sinus beat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51529\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51529 \">waveform 3</a>). Ventricular bigeminy may become self-perpetuating, a situation known as the rule of bigeminy. This occurs because the long cycle length after the prior PVC tends to precipitate the next PVC after a sinus beat. The presence of ventricular bigeminy indicates a repeating pattern but has no other clinical implications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular trigeminy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular trigeminy is present when there are two sinus beats followed by the ventricular premature beat. Thus, every third beat is a ventricular premature beat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64181\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64181 \">waveform 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular couplets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular couplets are defined as two PVCs in a row (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63258\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63258 \">waveform 5</a>). There is often a compensatory pause after the second premature beat. The two premature beats may have an identical morphology (unifocal couplet), or their morphology may differ (multifocal couplet). The RR interval between the two successive PVCs varies widely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTRICULAR ESCAPE COMPLEXES OR RHYTHM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An escape ventricular beat or rhythm occurs when there is failure of the sinus and atrioventricular (AV) node to generate an impulse. There is an absence of P wave activity, associated with a widened QRS complex that resembles a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) and occurs after a pause of variable duration (but always greater than the normal sinus RR interval). Persistence of this activity leads to multiple successive ventricular complexes, representing an escape ventricular rhythm with a rate that is slower than the normal sinus rhythm. In cases of complete or third degree heart block in which there is sinus node activity but failure of conduction through the AV node, there are P waves dissociated from the ventricular complexes with a rate faster than the ventricular rate (AV dissociation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54024\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54024 \">waveform 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTRICULAR PARASYSTOLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular parasystole represents an independent ectopic ventricular rhythm that has no relationship to the sinus rhythm. It appears on the electrocardiogram (ECG) as unifocal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with a variable coupling cycle (the interval between the prior sinus beat and the premature beat varies) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70928\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef70928 \">waveform 7</a>). The interval between two successive PVCs is always constant or some integer of the underlying rate of the ectopic focus.</p><p>Ventricular parasystole is the result of an ectopic focus within the ventricular myocardium or ventricular conduction system that manifests spontaneous automaticity and has a rate that is slower than the underlying sinus rate. This focus is not suppressed or overdriven by the normal ventricular conduction because of entrance block into the area of the ectopic focus; it is protected from suppression. However, the ectopic focus may or may not activate the ventricular myocardium and result in a PVC, depending on the ability of the rest of the ventricular myocardium to be stimulated, which in turn is determined by its state of refractoriness. Thus, there may also be intermittent exit block from this focus, and the PVC does not appear at the expected time, but later PVCs are present at the underlying rate of the parasystolic focus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is defined as three or more successive ventricular complexes at a rate greater than 100 beats per minute. Nonsustained VT is a series of at least three consecutive ventricular beats that have a duration of less than 30 seconds or do not require emergency intervention; sustained VT lasts for more than 30 seconds or requires termination early because of hemodynamic impairment. The rhythm is usually regular, although there may be slight irregularity of the RR intervals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsustained-vt-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsustained VT in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The morphology of the QRS complex during VT is usually different when compared to the sinus beat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Additionally, it does not resemble either a typical left or right bundle branch block, as ventricular activation is not via the normal His-Purkinje conduction system, but is through direct ventricular myocardial activation. The QRS axis may be deviated to the left or to the right. The width of the QRS complex is generally &gt;0.16 sec when in a left bundle branch block pattern and &gt;0.14 sec when in a right bundle branch block pattern. Other useful features of ventricular tachycardia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, which is the hallmark of ventricular tachycardia. Subtle differences in ST-T wave morphology representing possible superimposed P waves should be assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of fusion or capture beats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of an RS complex in all of the precordial leads.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longest R to S interval &gt;100 ms in any precordial lead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concordance of the QRS complex across the precordial leads (eg, R waves or S waves only in leads V1-V6). However, this may be seen in any situation in which there is direct myocardial activation, including Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern or a paced complex. Negative concordance is less useful, as this may be seen with a left bundle branch block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A monophasic Rr' pattern in lead 1 (termed rabbit ears) with a taller left ear. This is often associated with an rS or QS complex morphology in leads V5-V6.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An indeterminate axis (between -90 and -180&ordm;). However, this may be seen in any situation in which there is direct myocardial activation including a paced rhythm (especially biventricular pacing) or Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In lead II, time from beginning of the QRS to first change of polarity &ge;50ms, regardless of whether the QRS change is positive or negative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In lead aVR, an initial R wave, width of the r or q wave &gt;40ms, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> notch on the descending limb of a predominantly negative QRS. </p><p/><p>The VT is monomorphic when all of the QRS complexes of an episode are identical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63176\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63176 \">waveform 8</a>). However, monomorphic VT often displays subtle changes of the QRS complexes with regard to morphology and width as a result of variable changes in the electrophysiologic properties of the ventricular myocardium.</p><p>When the QRS complexes within each episode display changing morphologies, often with grossly irregular RR intervals, the VT is called polymorphic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80829\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80829 \">waveform 9</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and other polymorphic ventricular tachycardias with a normal QT interval&quot;</a>.) The differences in QRS morphology result from changes in the direction (vector) of myocardial activation due to marked heterogeneity of the electrophysiologic characteristics of the ventricular myocardium. The rate is usually between 100 and 330 beats per minute. If the polymorphic VT is associated with a baseline QRS complex that has a normal QT interval, the most common etiology is ischemia. If the polymorphic VT is associated with a QRS complex on the baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) that has QT prolongation, then the polymorphic VT is termed &ldquo;torsades de pointes.&rdquo; The QT prolongation may be acquired, due to medications that prolong the QT interval (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Torsades de pointes'</a>) or congenital, the result of a channelopathy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>). &#160; </p><p>The presence of AV dissociation is a very important finding and is usually diagnostic of VT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a>.) However, it is not always present, or if present may not be easily recognized, especially when the ventricular rate is very rapid (the RR cycle length is short). The P waves are not distinctive in these cases, but may alter the QRS complexes or be superimposed upon the ST and T waves, causing irregular changes in their morphology.</p><p>AV dissociation occurs as a result of retrograde VA conduction that enters, but blocks, within the AV node (concealed conduction). The retrograde concealed conduction into the node causes the node to be refractory to antegrade stimulation, thereby blocking conduction from the atrium to the ventricle. If the tachycardia does not lead to AV block, fusion or capture beats may be present, as described below. In some cases of VT, there is retrograde conduction through the AV node and retrograde activation of the atria. There may be a variable degree of retrograde block (2:1, 3:1, or even Wenckebach); on occasion, there may be 1:1 retrograde activation of the atrium and therefore no AV dissociation with a fixed RP interval. Dissociation is more obvious when the tachycardia rate is relatively slow. The P waves occur at a slower rate than the QRS complexes, and there is no relationship between them.</p><p>Other features of AV dissociation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fusion beats, which occur with a QRS complex that has features resembling a combination of the both the sinus QRS and that of the VT. These result from simultaneous activation of the ventricles from the VT exit site as well as via a sinus beat travelling down the normal AV nodal-His Purkinje pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Capture or Dressler beats, which are intermittently captured QRS complexes that are identical to sinus complexes. They are preceded by a P wave, indicating that there is intermittent capture of the ventricles by the sinus node via the normal AV nodal-His Purkinje pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72600\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72600 \">waveform 10</a>). However, the occurrence of intermittent capture of the ventricle from above does not alter the VT or affect its focus of origin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89792447\"><span class=\"h2\">Repetitive monomorphic ventricular tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repetitive monomorphic VT occurs in those with no structural heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>It most frequently originates from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) just inferior to the pulmonary valve, but less frequently may occur in the left ventricular outflow tract, sinuses of Valsalva, or other areas of the heart. RVOT VT has the ECG appearance of a left bundle branch block pattern with an inferiorly directed axis. In general, these have a benign prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular flutter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular flutter is a monomorphic VT that occurs at a very rapid rate, usually around 300 beats per minute (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65800\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65800 \">waveform 11</a>). Often no distinctive T waves are discernible. There is no isoelectric interval between QRS complexes. P waves or evidence of atrial activity are absent since the ventricular rate is rapid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Torsades de pointes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Torsades de pointes is a rapid and distinct form of polymorphic VT associated with a baseline prolonged QT interval. It means &quot;twisting of points,&quot; a name that refers to the continuously changing axis of polymorphic QRS morphologies that are observed during each episode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53891%7ECARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53891 graphicRef73827 \">waveform 12A-B</a>). The typical form is initiated by bradycardia or is pause dependent, with a short-long-short coupling interval, ie, a PVC (short RR interval), a compensatory pause (long RR interval), and second PVC (short RR interval) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73827 \">waveform 12B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.) If the baseline QTc interval is normal, the rhythm is referred to as polymorphic VT and not torsades de pointes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCELERATED IDIOVENTRICULAR RHYTHM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) is a repetitive ventricular rhythm occurring at a rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52385\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52385 \">waveform 13</a>). It may be the result of an accelerated ventricular focus that generates an impulse faster than the sinus node and therefore assumes control. There may or may not be atrioventricular (AV) dissociation; if dissociation is present, the atrial rate is slower than the ventricular rate and the PP intervals are longer than the RR intervals. On the other hand, if the idioventricular rhythm represents an escape rhythm (generally the result of third degree AV nodal block), the P waves are dissociated from the QRS impulses and the atrial rate is faster than the ventricular rate. In the setting of acute ischemia, AIVR may be a marker of spontaneous or induced reperfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular fibrillation is identified by the complete absence of properly formed QRS complexes and no obvious P waves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80454\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80454 \">waveform 14</a>). There is no uniform activation of the ventricular myocardium and the QRS complexes have markedly different morphology, axis, and amplitude. The rate is irregular and usually greater than 300 beats per minute. When the fibrillation is recent onset, the amplitude is usually high, but as time passes, the fibrillatory waves become finer and may resemble asystole. Ventricular fibrillation leads promptly to cardiac arrest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16447521\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are early occurring beats originating from the left or right ventricle with widened QRS complexes that have a distinct morphology that is markedly different from the sinus QRS complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57511\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57511 \">waveform 1</a>).
