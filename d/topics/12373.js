This electrical activity can be recorded via surface or needle electrodes, the latter being used far more commonly in the clinical setting, and is evaluated during needle insertion, during periods of rest (spontaneous activity), and during periods of voluntary muscle contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the basic principles of EMG. Detailed discussions of the clinical utility of EMG are presented separately in topic reviews relating to specific diseases. Nerve conductions studies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve conduction studies: Late responses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEEDLE ELECTRODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Needle electrodes measure the electric potential difference between two sites. They are usually monopolar or concentric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the monopolar electrode, the needle serves as the active recording site, and a surface electrode some distance away serves as the reference electrode</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the concentric electrode, which looks like a hypodermic needle, a fine wire in the center serves as the active electrode, with the needle cannula as the reference</p><p/><p>Monopolar electrodes are less expensive and less painful. However, they generate larger and more complex potentials, which are less stable electrically. With the concentric electrode, the fixed distance between wire and cannula allows for greater standardization of recorded electrical activity and lower baseline noise. Ground electrodes are also necessary whichever recording electrode is used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE MOTOR UNIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomical concept most relevant to understanding the electrical activity of muscle is Liddell and Sherrington's motor unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The motor unit consists of an anterior horn cell, its axon, and terminal branches (all of which make up the motor neuron), the neuromuscular junction, and all the individual muscle fibers it innervates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60675 \">figure 1</a>). The size of the motor unit, that is the number of muscle fibers innervated by a single anterior horn cell, varies with each muscle. In general, muscles exhibiting fine motor control have low innervation ratios (eg, 10 to 20:1 in the extraocular muscles), whereas big, bulk-supporting muscles have high innervation ratios (eg, 1500 to 2000:1 in the gastrocnemius muscle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The muscle fibers composing a single motor unit are distributed in a circular or oval territory, the dimensions of which are dependent upon muscle fiber number and size, length of nerve terminal branches, and distribution of motor endplates in the muscle's endplate region. Arm muscles have motor unit territory diameters of 5 to 7 mm, whereas leg muscle motor unit territory diameters are in the 7 to 12 mm range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Within the territory of a motor unit, muscle fiber density is greatest in the center and less in the periphery with some subgrouping of fibers like clusters of grapes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These territories are not solid; muscle fibers in one motor unit interdigitate with muscle fibers from other motor units so that a recording electrode in one place may pick up electrical activity from as many as four to six motor units within close proximity to its tip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor unit action potential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an anterior horn cell is activated, or its axon stimulated, all muscle fibers belonging to that motor unit, that is, innervated by that anterior horn cell's nerve terminal branches, are depolarized synchronously. The electrical activity from these individual muscle fibers summates to generate a motor unit action potential (MUAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This results in a waveform that is characteristically triphasic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54013\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54013 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive (downward) deflection as the electrical impulse moves along the muscle fiber membrane towards the extracellular recording electrode</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A negative (upward) deflection when the impulse reaches the electrode</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another positive (downward) deflection as the impulse moves away from the electrode</p><p/><p>The desired goal of MUAP analysis is to distinguish normal from abnormal potentials, and to determine whether abnormalities reflect neurogenic or myopathic processes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">MUAP waveform morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volitional activity of minimal force is necessary to evaluate the morphology of individual MUAPs without interference. However, according to Henneman's size principle, smaller anterior horn cells and their motor units, having lower excitability thresholds, are activated first at low force levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Larger anterior horn cells, incorporating larger motor unit territories, are recruited only with increasing force. Therefore, standard EMG technique only evaluates MUAPs from smaller motor units, despite the substantial clinical significance of larger motor units.</p><p>This de facto bias is important to understand when making <span class=\"nowrap\">EMG/clinical</span> correlations. Other techniques such as macro EMG, decomposition-based quantitative EMG, and high-density surface EMG are better able to assess the wide variety of motor units and their MUAPs present in normal and diseased muscle.</p><p>Certain specific characteristics of MUAP waveform morphology are important in evaluating the state of health or type of disease affecting the motor unit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54013\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54013 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum peak-to-peak amplitude</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rise time of the initial positive-negative peak (spike)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration (eg, the time between when the MUAP signal leaves the baseline to when it returns)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of phases (eg, the number of times the waveform crosses the baseline plus one)</p><p/><p>No electrode system can evaluate all muscle fibers within a motor unit; the MUAP represents only part of the electrical activity of the motor unit being recorded from. This principle is illustrated by the observation that a needle with a small recording tip is not able to record the electrical activity from all 1500 to 2000 muscle fibers in a gastrocnemius motor unit.</p><p>To be sure that the sample of MUAPs studied is representative of the muscle as a whole, the electromyographer should record multiple MUAPs, typically 20 to 30 or more from multiple sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As the electrode can record multiple MUAPs at each recording site, interference of MUAPs with each other is common. However, motor units do not fire synchronously. Therefore, two MUAPs appearing simultaneously on one occasion are very unlikely to appear simultaneously again; when seen separately they can be accurately analyzed. With modern equipment, it is estimated that six MUAPs can be recruited at each electrode site with 10 seconds of moderate muscle activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Recording a single MUAP three or more times will allow a true evaluation of that MUAP's waveform. The morphology of MUAPs in a specific muscle in an individual patient can then be compared with standards for patients evaluated in that particular laboratory and elsewhere. However, while age and muscle-dependent normal values have been determined for amplitude and duration of motor units, it should be recognized that most EMG analysis is qualitative, and thus interpretation is critically dependent on the experience and skill of the operator.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Amplitude and spike rise time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper electrode placement is crucial to MUAP evaluation. The central element of the MUAP, the spike, is generated by only a small number of fibers, fewer than 10 for a normal MUAP, lying within 0.5 mm of the electrode tip. A spike rise time of &lt;0.5 ms indicates that the muscle fibers generating the spike are &lt;0.5 mm from the electrode's recording tip and that the electrode is correctly placed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65788\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65788 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Spike amplitude is not related to the number of muscle fibers in each motor unit, but rather to the size (the diameter of the closest muscle fibers) and density of muscle fibers from a single motor unit in close proximity to the electrode (and also to special characteristics of the electrode recording tip itself). Slight movement of the electrode tip can change the waveform of a single MUAP, with much greater effect on MUAP amplitude than on duration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57159\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57159 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65788\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65788 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of the MUAP is determined by several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size of muscle fibers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of muscle fibers of a particular motor unit close to the recording electrode (muscle fiber density)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spatial dispersion of the motor unit's terminal axons in the endplate zone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differing conduction velocities of the depolarizing waves in the terminal axons and muscle fibers</p><p/><p>The latter two mechanisms, in particular, introduce variability into the activation of muscle fibers; their electrical activity reaches the electrode with slight discordancy or lack of synchrony, which when measured with single fiber EMG is called jitter. (Although not related to the MUAP per se, slight perturbations in neuromuscular transmission also influence jitter.) This variability results in phase additions and cancellations and temporal dispersion of electrical activity within the MUAP. Thus, whereas the duration of the electrical potential of a single fiber is fairly constant at 3 to 4 ms, the duration of the summated or compound triphasic MUAP is more varied, usually in the range of 8 to 13 ms or longer.</p><p>It is a common misunderstanding that MUAP duration reflects the size of the motor unit territory. It does not. Rather, MUAP duration reflects the activity of all muscle fibers within the range of the electrode tip (approximately 2.5 mm). Nonetheless, duration of the MUAP is more representative of the state of the motor unit than is amplitude, in part because the number of muscle fibers contributing to the duration is much greater than those that contribute to the spike, and in part because needle movement has a lesser effect on duration than on amplitude (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57159\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57159 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65788\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65788 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>The duration of the MUAP varies from muscle to muscle and increases with age. From childhood to early adulthood, the increase in MUAP duration is due to increasing muscle fiber size. From early adulthood to old age, duration is dependent upon remodeling of the motor unit and slowing in conduction along nerve terminal fibers and the muscle fibers themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. Remodeling occurs because of a gradual loss of anterior horn cells with age and incorporation of denervated muscle fibers into surviving motor units. This is evident morphologically by mild muscle fiber type grouping and electrophysiologically by increased muscle fiber density in older normal subjects.</p><p>The normal mean duration of MUAPs from the biceps brachii is 7.7 ms at birth, 10 ms at age 20, 11.1 ms at age 40, 11.9 ms at age 60, and 12.8 ms at age 80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The corresponding values for the abductor pollicis brevis are 6.2 ms, 9.2 ms, 9.3 ms, 9.5 ms, and 9.5 ms, respectively. These values, though valuable as a frame of reference, were obtained using a manual method of recording that is no longer in use.</p><p>It is possible that the change in MUAP duration with aging is associated with increasing neuromuscular instability, as measured with the techniques of near fiber jiggle (which assesses the amount of variability in the shape of MUAPs over consecutive discharges of a single motor unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]) and decomposition-based quantitative electromyography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This increased neuromuscular transmission instability is also seen in diabetic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Phases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The last important morphological feature of the MUAP is the phase number. A phase is that part of the waveform between baseline crossings. The normal MUAP has four or fewer phases. MUAPs with more than four phases are called polyphasic potentials and constitute no more than 12 to 15 percent of the MUAPs of a normal muscle when studied with a concentric electrode (up to 35 percent of MUAPs may be polyphasic with monopolar electrodes). It is not uncommon to see directional changes in the waveform that do not cross the baseline; these are called turns (or serrations). More than five turns is abnormal; however, turns are not usually measured in routine EMG studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">MUAP recruitment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal subjects, muscles are silent at rest. With minimal volition, single motor units are activated semi-rhythmically, smaller units first. Greater voluntary activity will increase the firing rates of already active motor units and recruit previously silent units of increasing size. Morphometric MUAP analysis must be performed with minimal volition so that the waveform can be clearly visualized. Smaller motor units are recruited at low volition; larger motor units recruited during higher levels of muscle activity often obscure one another, making individual MUAP analysis difficult. However, modern instrument technology allows for faster and potentially more sophisticated MUAP analysis by its ability to decompose trains of MUAPs from EMG signals generated by a single muscle contraction. With higher levels of muscle activity a greater and more representative range of MUAPs can be sampled and additional physiologic parameters analyzed. Validation of these methods is still necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">EMG interference pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the muscle force increases, each MUAP will begin to obscure waveforms of other active units, and this interference among waveforms is called the interference pattern. With maximal recruitment, individual MUAPs cannot be discerned, since a large number of units are brought into action.</p><p>A normal full interference pattern demonstrates a rapid build-up of MUAP recruitment of increasing amplitude until, at maximal effort, the electrical activity is a mess of wavy lines with a general amplitude of 2 to 4 mv.</p><p>Some patients are unable or unwilling to exert a maximal effort and the pattern will be less dense as a result. Hence, the degree of effort has to be taken into account when assessing the interference pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RECORDING STAGES AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best approach to the electromyographic study of each muscle consists of four separate stages. Each stage is evaluated at multiple recording sites by redirecting the needle after skin insertion at two or more places:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insertional activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous activity at complete rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Qualitative or quantitative motor unit action potential (MUAP) waveform analysis during minimal voluntary contraction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recruitment of MUAPs during increasing voluntary muscle contraction to maximal levels &ndash; the interference pattern</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Insertional activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With insertion of the electrode into a muscle, it is normal to see brief bursts of electrical activity due to mechanical irritation and depolarization of muscle fibers that minimally exceed the time of the needle movement (approximately 50 ms). Individually, these bursts can consist of high-frequency spikes of varying shapes and sizes or fibrillations, positive sharp waves, or complex repetitive discharges. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Fibrillations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Positive sharp waves'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Complex repetitive discharges'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence and degree of insertional activity is often dependent upon the velocity of needle insertion. Slowly inserted needles generate little or no activity. Continued burst firing of potentials well after needle movement has ceased is abnormal and constitutes increased insertional activity; it is commonly seen in denervation, myotonic, or inflammatory conditions. Decreased insertional activity is seen in atrophic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrotic muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned, normal muscle is electrically silent at rest. An exception is potentials that occur in the region of the muscle endplate. Other types of spontaneous electrical activity at rest are pathologic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Endplate potentials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the electrode is placed in the endplate area of any muscle, it can irritate terminal axons and generate spontaneous electrical activity consisting of rapidly firing, biphasic, small amplitude (100 to 200 &micro;V), short duration (3 to 4 ms) spikes with negative (upward) onset. These endplate potentials may occur in clusters and do not propagate away from the endplate area. When the needle is moved outside the endplate area, they disappear. Parenthetically, electrode placement in the endplate area is usually more painful than elsewhere in the muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Fibrillations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrillation potentials occur when an individual muscle fiber is denervated (eg, it is no longer innervated by its nerve terminal). The denervated muscle fiber spontaneously produces a muscle action potential, or fibrillation potential. Fibrillation potentials are small (&lt;500 &micro;V), short (&lt;5 ms in duration), biphasic or triphasic, and fire regularly or sometimes irregularly. The sound accompanying them has been likened to &quot;rain on a tin roof.&quot;</p><p>When recorded by an electrode in the endplate region, fibrillations may be difficult to differentiate from endplate potentials, but when they are seen outside the endplate area, fibrillations have an initial positive (downward) deflection, whereas the initial deflection of the endplate potential is negative. Fibrillation potentials, if observed, are scored according to a semiquantitative grading system of 1+ when spontaneous activity is rare, to 4+ when spontaneous potentials fill the oscilloscope screen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Positive sharp waves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positive sharp waves also emanate from denervated muscle fibers and have the same clinical significance as fibrillations. They have a sharp initial positive deflection followed by a longer, lower amplitude negative phase than fibrillation potentials.</p><p>Positive sharp waves and fibrillation potentials appear to be dependent upon the electrode's relationship to the muscle fiber membrane; if the needle tip is at the membrane, a negative spike may not occur. The positive sharp wave can be considered a 'blocked' fibrillation potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The author and other investigators have observed fibrillation potentials assume the configuration of positive sharp waves, or vice versa, with slight adjustments of the electrode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64976\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64976 \">waveform 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Presumably, the negative spike of the fibrillation potential becomes manifest as the electrode is moved away from the membrane or disappears with <span class=\"nowrap\">electrode/membrane</span> contact.</p><p>An alternative view postulates two distinct populations of positive sharp waves: a minority that arise as blocked fibrillation potentials, and a majority (each representing a single muscle-fiber discharge) that arise at the electrode adjacent to a perielectrode-induced zone of crushed muscle membrane and then propagate away from it, with similar short maximal depolarization times as end point potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Denervation potentials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrillations and positive sharp waves are the classic denervation potentials and are well known in acute neurogenic diseases or nerve trauma. These potentials usually become evident 10 to 14 days after acute nerve injury, but the further the tested muscle is from the site of nerve injury, the later their time of onset.</p><p>It is easy to understand that a muscle fiber deprived of its innervation from a terminal axon will react abnormally. However, denervation potentials may also be seen in myopathic disorders, particularly those of acute onset or with inflammation. In that context, the attendant segmental necrosis renders sections of muscle fibers no longer in contact with terminal axons. However, these segments are alive, as they have a blood supply, and they will fire spontaneously since they are effectively denervated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Complex repetitive discharges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complex repetitive discharges (CRDs) are bursts of potentials, each having the appearance of grouped fibrillations or positive sharp waves that begin and end suddenly. Each burst is multiphasic and composed of up to 10 spike components representing the firing of individual muscle fibers, and can last for up to 100 ms. One muscle fiber acts as a pacemaker, driving other muscle fibers via ephaptic activation. When many muscle fibers are activated, high-amplitude spikes occur. The bursts end when muscle fibers become fatigued, but can start up again when a new pacemaker starts firing again. The bursts sound like a machine gun.</p><p>When present, CRDs never occur in isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. While CRDs occur in both neuropathies and myopathies, the risk of CRDs occurring in myopathies is six times that of other diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. They are especially noted in some muscular dystrophies and the Schwartz-Jampel syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Myotonic discharges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myotonic discharges are spontaneous independent repetitive potentials arising from single muscle fibers that are evoked by needle insertion, needle movement, or voluntary contraction. While they resemble positive sharp waves or fibrillations, myotonic discharges wax and wane in both amplitude and frequency, and have the whining nature that some have thought similar to the sound of World War II dive bombers.</p><p>Myotonic discharges are seen in the various inheritable myotonias (myotonic dystrophy, myotonia congenita, paramyotonia congenita), Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, and glycogen storage diseases (most often glycogen storage disease II or Pompe disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Both myotonic discharges and complex repetitive discharges were found in patients with myofibrillar myopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Fasciculations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fasciculations are single motor unit potentials that are activated spontaneously. They can look like normal or polyphasic voluntarily activated MUAPs but fire irregularly and may or may not be voluntarily activated. Fasciculation potentials may be a normal finding, in which case they are considered benign, but are frequently seen in pathologic conditions. They can arise proximally or distally within the motor neurons. There is some evidence to suggest that benign fasciculations are more likely to arise proximally, whereas pathologic fasciculations associated with chronic partial denervation are more likely to arise distally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>It may be difficult to differentiate benign fasciculations from those associated with disease. In general, benign fasciculations have faster firing rates and occur in muscles below the knees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Fasciculations are well known to occur in motor neuron disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but can also be seen in radiculopathies, entrapment neuropathies, and metabolic disorders such as thyrotoxicosis, tetany, and anticholinesterase overdoses. Unlike other spontaneous potentials, fasciculations can be visible on clinical examination when they occur on the surface of muscles. One advantage to the needle EMG evaluation is the ability to record fasciculations from deep within the muscle body that are not clinically visible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Myokymia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myokymia consists of bursts of MUAPs, usually 2 to 10, firing at rates of 20 to 150 Hz. The bursts consist of regular or irregular doublets, triplets, or multiplets. Between bursts there is electrical silence. The discharge generator is thought to be located along the motor axon. Muscles containing myokymic discharges typically demonstrate vermicular movements on examination that look like a &quot;bag of worms.&quot;</p><p>Myokymia can be differentiated from CRDs in that the spike pattern is not regular from one burst to another, and the bursting does not typically start and stop abruptly. Furthermore, myokymic discharges consist of MUAPs, whereas CRDs consist of fibrillations or positive sharp waves. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Complex repetitive discharges'</a> above.)</p><p>Myokymia can occur in normal subjects in the orbicularis oculi or oris muscles (eyelid myokymia). Focal myokymic discharges occur in facial muscles when the facial nerve or its nucleus is affected. Segmental myokymic discharges can occur in radiculopathies, radiation plexopathies, and occasional anterior horn cell damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Generalized myokymia is seen rarely in metabolic disorders and inflammatory neuropathies.</p><p>Neuromyotonic discharges are similar but fire at higher frequencies (150 to 300 Hz) and may begin and end abruptly with waxing amplitudes. They are associated with Isaacs syndrome and Morvan syndrome. These two phenomena &ndash; myokymia and neuromyotonia &ndash; probably represent a continuum of an abnormality in voltage-gated K+ channels, with neuromyotonia characterized by more numerous discharges and persistent clinical contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Neuromyotonia is clinically manifested by sustained and visible muscle contractions, often inducing cramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Cramps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cramps are sustained involuntary muscle contractions caused by the activation of multiple motor units. They occur in normal subjects, especially in the calves and feet, and disease states such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One small study found an inverse correlation between the cramp threshold frequency (the minimum electrical stimulation frequency at which a muscle cramps) and a history of cramping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This finding suggests that the cramp threshold frequency might be useful to identify individuals with an increased risk of cramping.</p><p>Muscle contractions associated with electrical silence are termed contractures and occur in McArdle disease and other glycogenoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimal voluntary activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With minimal voluntary activation, motor units normally discharge semi-rhythmically, separated by slightly variable intervals of 50 to 250 ms (4 to 20 Hz). Occasionally, however, a motor unit will discharge at unusually short intervals of 2 to 20 ms with two (doublets), three (triplets), or more (multiplets) sequential MUAPs. When this occurs, the amplitudes of the subsequent MUAPs may be lower than the initial one. These doublets, triplets, or multiplets can occur in normal individuals, but are more likely to be seen in hyperexcitable states such as hyperventilation and tetany, and in neuronal disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and Isaacs syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>During minimal volition, the morphology of individual MUAPs can be analyzed for pathologic evidence of motor unit remodeling. In neuropathic disorders, the sites of pathology can be at the anterior horn cell, axon, or terminal axon branches; the common pathologic denominator is a decrease in the number of functioning motor units. The processes of denervation and reinnervation occur simultaneously; the electrophysiologic picture represents the balance between them at one particular point in time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute complete denervation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In acute complete denervation, no motor units can be voluntarily activated, and voluntary muscle contraction does not occur. Therefore, no MUAPs can be recorded.</p><p>Reinnervation can occur only by regrowth of axons along the original nerve fiber tracts. As axons grow at rates of approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/day,</span> reinnervation can be very delayed and incomplete in muscles distant from the site of injury.</p><p>Eventually, as reinnervation of muscle fibers begins, voluntary activation of motor units will commence, but the nascent MUAPs will be small (ie, of low amplitude and short duration), due to the small numbers of muscle fibers initially reinnervated, and complex, due to dispersion of endplates, slowed conduction along terminal axons and muscle fibers, and asynchronous firing of muscle fibers. The nascent MUAPs may resemble the complex, low amplitude, short duration MUAPs seen in myopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/12,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,35</a>].</p><p>With time, as the reinnervation process proceeds, these MUAPs will enlarge and be more typical of &quot;neuropathic MUAPs.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic partial denervation and neuropathic MUAPs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the much more common clinical situation of chronic partial denervation, muscle fibers can be reinnervated by collateral branching of terminal axons from surviving motor units, resulting in an increase in that muscle's innervation ratio; that is, the number of muscle fibers per surviving motor unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. By incorporating muscle fibers from denervated motor units through collateral sprouting, a single motor unit can increase the number of muscle fibers that it innervates by an estimated two to five times normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Another mechanism to compensate for motor unit loss is hypertrophy of surviving muscle fibers.</p><p>The waveform of the neuropathic MUAP that results from chronic partial denervation and reinnervation varies depending upon the time elapsing from onset of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Within the first two months after an acute nerve injury, as denervated muscle fibers atrophy, the distance between the muscle fibers in surviving motor units decreases and fiber density around the electrode tip increases, leading to increased spatial summation. Also, a few weeks after injury, collateral sprouting begins and previously denervated muscle fibers are reinnervated and incorporated within the surviving motor unit.</p><p>The combination of these two mechanisms results in an increased MUAP amplitude. In addition, slowed conduction along newly formed terminal axons and increased dispersion of endplates along these muscle fibers results in increased MUAP duration and asynchronous electrical activity. This process is evidenced by an increase in phases (polyphasia) and the development of satellite potentials, also known as late components. These satellite potentials fire after the main MUAP but are time-linked to the main potential.</p><p>For these reasons, the characteristic neuropathic MUAP shows increased amplitude and duration, and there is an increased incidence of polyphasia, sometimes with satellite potentials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57740\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57740 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Myopathic disorder and myopathic MUAPs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The picture seen in a myopathic disorder is very different from a neuropathic one. The number of motor units is normal in myopathies, but there is a pathologic loss of muscle fibers within motor units.</p><p>Myopathic MUAPs reflect the smaller motor units, and are characterized by lower amplitude, shorter duration, and an increased number of phases. The resulting myopathic MUAPs have been termed BSAPs (brief, small, abundant potentials) or BSAPPs (polyphasic BSAPs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57740\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57740 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p>The lower amplitude of myopathic MUAPs occurs because of the loss of muscle fibers around the electrode tip, and the shorter duration is due to loss of muscle fibers in the periphery of the electrode's uptake area that contribute to the initial and terminal phases of the MUAP. The increases in the number of phases and turns is related to desynchronization of the spike, which in turn could be due to multiple factors that include dropout of muscle fibers close to the recording electrode, scatter of the endplate regions of surviving muscle fibers, variation in the diameters and conduction velocities of the surviving muscle fibers and regenerating muscle fibers, and longitudinal fiber splitting.</p><p>As will be discussed, these myopathic MUAPs are not pathognomonic of a myopathic disorder, as they can also be seen in neurogenic disorders after acute denervation, or in disorders of neuromuscular transmission when there is MUAP instability due to intermittent failure of endplate depolarization. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Clinical context'</a> below.)</p><p>Finally, MUAPs may look normal in a myopathic process if muscle involvement is focal or patchy, or if muscle fiber electrical properties are unaffected by disease. In the case of a metabolic disorder of muscle, with a deficit in excitation-contraction coupling, a normal-appearing electrical potential can generate less than normal force. In such a situation, the pattern of motor unit activation is the only electrophysiologic abnormality that can be observed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of voluntary activity</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuropathic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In neuropathic disorders, there are fewer voluntary motor units available to respond to central drive. A pattern of reduced recruitment is observed, such that increasing effort produces more rapid firing in a reduced number of units. This pattern is best observed with submaximal effort. At its most extreme, single unit recruitment occurs, in which a single motor unit firing up to 30-40 Hz is observed in isolation. With maximal effort, there will be less interference of MUAPs with each other, and discrete MUAPs can be seen. Since these surviving motor units are larger than normal with increased fiber density near the electrode, the amplitude of these MUAPs and, hence, the amplitude of the interference pattern will be increased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57740\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57740 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Myopathic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In myopathic disorders, the total number of units is normal, but the force generated by individual motor units is reduced, so that more motor units must be activated and motor unit firing rate must be increased in order to produce a given constant force level. Early recruitment of a greater number of rapidly firing motor units is the hallmark of myopathy. With maximum effort, the amplitude of the interference pattern is often reduced, but the overall pattern is often similar to normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57740\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57740 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPICAL PATTERNS OF ABNORMALITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In acute neuropathic disorders, denervation potentials, fibrillations and positive sharp waves, and sometimes complex repetitive discharges (CRDs) and fasciculations begin usually 10 to 14 days after injury. They will persist until the denervated muscle fibers are either reinnervated or die. Reinnervation via collateral sprouting of terminal axons begins and polyphasic potentials of increased duration and amplitude become noticeable usually at six to eight weeks. Remodeling of the motor unit is dependent upon the numbers of surviving motor units, and may take as long as one year when the loss of motor units is great.</p><p>During the reinnervation phase, the amount of denervation activity will decrease and ultimately disappear. The numbers of polyphasic potentials will increase for a few months, and then as conduction times in the terminal axons increase, muscle fiber firing will become more synchronous, and the number of phases will lessen while the amplitude and durations of the motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) increase. Early in the recovery phase of acute injury, the amplitude of the interference pattern can be reduced, but later amplitudes become increased.</p><p>In indolent, slowly progressive neuropathic processes, denervation potentials may be hard to find; all that is seen is the chronic remodeled MUAP.</p><p>More rapidly progressive neuropathic disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, will have prominent denervation and reinnervation processes going on simultaneously. Evidence of acute denervation is observed in the form of fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and fasciculations when MUAPs are large and complex. Eventually, denervation overwhelms reinnervation and MUAPs are lost. Maximal volition when force is minimal may show only isolated MUAPs. These changes are perhaps best shown in experimental models. In transgenic rat models of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <span class=\"nowrap\">(SOD1/G93A),</span> loss of the large diameter motor fibers that innervated the largest motor units occurred earliest, even before clinically visible signs of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Attempts at reinnervation mainly occurred in small-diameter motor axons, which gained some of the large fiber physiologic characteristics (eg, increased twitch force), thereby appearing for a time to be more resistant to the pathologic processes.</p><p>The relationship between the speed of progression of the neuropathic disorder and denervation activity was explored in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (rapidly progressive) compared with patients who had genetically confirmed late-onset spinal motor neuronopathy and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (slowly progressive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The absence of fibrillations was associated with the slowly progressive forms (66 to 77 percent sensitivity, 93 percent specificity).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Myopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In acute myopathic disorders with active inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis, denervation activity can be prominent, MUAPs will be small and polyphasic, and recruitment patterns will be full with decreased amplitudes. In more chronic myopathies, large polyphasic MUAPs with satellite potentials can be common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical context</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In EMG analysis, no single abnormality is pathognomonic or diagnostic of a single disease process. Rather, the findings should be taken together and coordinated with the clinical picture to determine a disease pattern. It cannot be overemphasized that the electrophysiologic examination is an extension of the clinical investigation and must be interpreted in the proper clinical context.</p><p>There are always exceptions to the aforementioned findings and interpretations of MUAP morphology, as illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small polyphasic MUAPs (BSAPPs) can be seen early in the recovery phase of neuropathic disorders after severe denervation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MUAPs in myopathies can be of increased amplitude if the electrode tip records from hypertrophied muscle fibers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophied muscle fibers may split, resulting in complex firing patterns and polyphasia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Satellite potentials may occur with chronicity in certain muscular dystrophies and inflammatory myopathies when inflammation and necrosis denervate muscle fiber segments and reinnervation occurs with slowly conducting terminal axons over an increased endplate area</p><p/><p>One disease process that incorporates all these idiosyncrasies is inclusion body myositis. In neuromuscular transmission disorders such as myasthenia gravis, defined abnormalities in the MUAP waveform are not evident in early or mild to moderate disease.

Noninvasive genetic studies give greater precision to the diagnosis and often the prognosis of neuromuscular disorders such as the muscular dystrophies. Even in the myotonias, perhaps the most dramatic of abnormalities seen in electrophysiology, genetic studies give greater diagnostic information than EMG. Furthermore, other technologies may supplant the EMG in other diagnostic areas. Nevertheless, EMG continues to be extremely helpful in the neurogenic disorders and inflammatory myopathies. Despite advances in genetic and imaging studies, one study found that EMG evaluation of pediatric patients provided meaningful information in 94 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography (EMG) is the clinical study of the electrical activity of muscle fibers individually and collectively. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The motor unit consists of an anterior horn cell, its axon and terminal branches, and all the individual muscle fibers it innervates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60675 \">figure 1</a>). The size of the motor unit, that is the number of muscle fibers innervated by a single anterior horn cell, varies with each muscle. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'The motor unit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an anterior horn cell is activated, all muscle fibers belonging to that motor unit are depolarized. The electrical activity from these muscle fibers summates to generate a motor unit action potential (MUAP). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Motor unit action potential'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The desired goal of MUAP analysis is the characterization of a disease process as neurogenic or myopathic, or normal. Certain characteristics of MUAP waveform morphology (MUAP amplitude, rise time of the initial spike, MUAP duration, and the number of phases) are particularly important in evaluating the motor unit. In addition, MUAP recruitment and analysis of the interference pattern can determine whether the number of MUAPs that are firing is appropriate for the level of activation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'MUAP waveform morphology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'MUAP recruitment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electromyographic study of each muscle consists of four separate stages, each evaluated at multiple recording sites (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Recording stages and pathophysiology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insertional activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spontaneous activity at complete rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MUAP waveform analysis during minimal voluntary contraction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MUAPs analysis during increasing voluntary muscle contraction to maximal levels and determination of the interference pattern</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needle electrode insertion is normally accompanied by brief bursts of electrical activity due to mechanical irritation. Continued burst firing of potentials well after needle movement has ceased is abnormal. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Insertional activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal muscle is electrically silent at rest with the exception of potentials that occur in the region of the muscle endplate. Other types of spontaneous electrical activity at rest may be pathologic; these include (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Spontaneous activity'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fibrillations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive sharp waves</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complex repetitive discharges</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Myotonic discharges</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fasciculations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Myokymia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cramps</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With minimal voluntary activity, the morphology of individual MUAPs can be analyzed for pathologic evidence of motor unit remodeling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57740\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57740 \">waveform 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Minimal voluntary activity'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neuropathic MUAPs are characterized by increased amplitude and duration, with an increased incidence of polyphasia and satellite potentials</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Myopathic MUAPs are characterized by decreased amplitude, shorter duration, and polyphasia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In neurogenic disorders, with maximal voluntary activity, the interference pattern itself is reduced due to fewer motor units and less interference of MUAPS with each other, but its amplitude is increased. In myopathic disorders, the interference pattern is normal because the number of motor units activated is normal, but its amplitude is reduced because of reduced numbers of muscle fibers in each motor unit and reduced force (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57740\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57740 \">waveform 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Patterns of voluntary activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electrophysiologic examination is an extension of the clinical investigation and must be interpreted in the proper clinical context. While typical neuropathic and myopathic patterns of EMG abnormalities are recognized, no single abnormality is pathognomonic or diagnostic of a single disease process, and there are always exceptions to the typical examples. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Typical patterns of abnormality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electromyography/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Daube JR, Rubin DI.
