Traveling physicians and other medical providers may suddenly find themselves in a difficult environment, in front of many onlookers, managing conditions they do not normally treat, with unfamiliar equipment. There are no universal guidelines for managing inflight medical events, but there are aspects of the aircraft environment and resources of which the treating clinician should be aware. This topic will review the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiology of inflight medical events and emergencies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cabin environment and how this may affect passengers with medical complaints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airline medical emergency protocols</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical resources aboard aircraft (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Resources on board an aircraft'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of common emergencies (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Common inflight medical emergencies and complaints'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liability and legal protection for Good Samaritans</p><p/><p>Screening of patients for air travel is discussed separately.

Inflight medical events (IFMEs) occur at a rate of approximately 15 to 100 per million passengers, with a death rate of 0.1 to 1 per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Thus, most events requiring medical assistance during commercial air travel are not life or limb-threatening emergencies. The precise incidence of IFMEs is unknown because there is no mandatory or uniform reporting system, and flight crews do not routinely report minor inflight medical incidents that do not require ground-based medical support (GBMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. More importantly, there is no consistent or widely accepted definition of what constitutes an IFME.</p><p>The advent of GBMS has substantially changed the way IFMEs are handled. GBMS is now used by most large international carriers and by virtually all United States based airlines. GBMS is usually provided by practicing emergency physicians who receive additional instruction about the aviation environment and operations. A medical event record is created each time a flight contacts GBMS. The threshold for using GBMS and the means of contact differ among airlines and over time. Variables include the communication capabilities of the aircraft (eg, radio only, satellite phone, specific telemedicine device) as well as the airline's culture. </p><p>As an example, from 1998 to 1999 British Airways had 92 emergencies per million passengers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Seventy percent of these were handled by the flight crew alone, leaving about 28 incidents per million passengers that generated a call for GBMS. A subsequent study reported that Air France flights made 1.9 calls to ground-based physicians per million passengers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A more recent study found that nine percent of inflight incidents prompted a call for GBMS advice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], while a review of five major airlines reported that 11,920 calls for medical assistance were made over approximately three years, during which 744 million passengers traveled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>These data suggest that most inflight medical events are not serious and are handled adequately by airline crews alone, as it is more likely that crewmembers would use GBMS for more serious events and true medical emergencies, unless that were not possible due to logistical obstacles (eg, immediate landing, communication black spots). Medical diversions (ie, premature landings for medical reasons) range from approximately 6 to 8 percent of flights requiring assistance from GBMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &#160;</p><p>A number of studies have attempted to examine airline emergencies in greater detail. Airport-based studies suggest an incidence of 16 to 25 emergencies per million passengers, which translates into approximately one medical emergency every 604 flights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/3,5-7,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-7,12,13</a>]. The fatality rate was approximately 0.1 to 0.3 deaths per million passengers. Other studies have examined all inflight events that occurred with a particular airline, or that generated a call from the airplane to GBMS. A few early studies of this type suggested that severe emergencies were increasing in number [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/3,5,8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,8,14</a>]. The Air France study, mentioned above, which covered the years from 1989 to 1999, noted that 35 percent of all calls recorded over the 10-year period were made in the final two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, available data are limited and should be interpreted with caution. A medical professional is present for 40 to 70 percent of inflight medical emergencies, and a doctor is present in 30 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/3,9,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,15,16</a>]. These numbers may be higher; fear of liability prevents some clinicians from intervening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Liability and legal protection for Good Samaritans'</a> below.)</p><p>The contemporary in-flight cabin environment is extremely well-tolerated by otherwise healthy passengers, and it is unlikely that the cabin environment per se would cause a medical emergency in the absence of a significant pre-existing condition. One possible exception is injuries related to unexpected, severe turbulence. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cabin environment'</a> below.)</p><p>Nevertheless, the cabin environment combined with other stresses from long-distance travel (eg, sleep deprivation, anxiety, disruption of medication schedule, transporting heavy luggage) may cause clinical decompensation in predisposed individuals. For patients with such predisposing conditions, appropriate assessment and education is important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of adult patients for air travel&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude, air travel, and heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumothorax-and-air-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumothorax and air travel&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adult-travelers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult travelers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two additional factors may be contributing to a rise in IFMEs: the proliferation of low-cost airlines and the growth of &quot;medical tourism,&quot; which may involve individuals with severe illness travelling to obtain low cost, quality health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, in general, the flying population mirrors the general population, and the incidence of serious medical events simply reflects the increased number of people participating in commercial air travel. Thus, the number of IFMEs will rise as the number of air travelers continues to increase, even if the relative rate of serious medical events remains unchanged. </p><p>Common medical complaints reported to airplane crews include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic, including syncope, dizziness, and seizure (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic events'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory, including asthma exacerbation (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory events'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal events'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac, including chest pain (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac events'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traumatic (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Head injury and other trauma'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal</p><p/><p>Neurologic, respiratory, and cardiac complaints comprise the most serious emergencies, as determined by aircraft diversion or the use of GBMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/1,3,7,9,10,15,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7,9,10,15,19,20</a>]. Among these, cardiac emergencies account for the highest rate of flight diversions and deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/3,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20,21</a>]. Nearly all such cases involve adults. </p><p>Nevertheless, although obstetrical and pediatric emergencies during commercial air flights are rare, they do occur. According to one review, approximately 7500 inflight medical emergencies involving children aboard commercial airlines were reported to GBMS between 2010 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Ten cases (0.13 percent) resulted in death, and nine involved children under the age of 2 (median age of 3.5 months). Two children were noted to be travelling to receive care for a severe pre-existing medical condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CABIN ENVIRONMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflight medical events may be precipitated by the unique physiologic stresses of air travel, including the conditions within the aircraft cabin. These factors most often exacerbate a passenger's chronic disease, or elicit an existing but heretofore unrecognized medical condition. Rarely, they may cause a novel medical problem in cases of an injury or in-flight transmission of a communicable disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commercial aircraft are pressurized during flight because passengers could not survive the low atmospheric pressure at the usual cruising altitude, which is commonly maintained between 30,000 to 40,000 feet (approximately 9100 to 12,200 m). It is impractical to maintain cabin pressure at sea level pressure (by flying at lower altitudes) because of aircraft weight and fuel economy, as more fuel is needed when flying at lower altitudes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, there is a maximum pressure gradient the aircraft fuselage can sustain without damage due to the increased wall tension. Thus, the aircraft cabin typically is pressurized to the equivalent of approximately 4000 to 8000 feet (approximately 1400 to 2500 m) above sea level, and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) specifies that an 8000-foot environment be maintained even at the highest operating altitude (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77616 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. During shorter flights (&lt;750 miles, or 1200 km), cabins are pressurized to the equivalent of lower altitudes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Cabin pressure is a function of the aircraft's actual altitude, and is automatically set through the aircraft's environmental control system. Different generations and types of aircraft have different rates of pressurization and ascending profiles. As an example, if permitted by air traffic control, smaller, lighter aircraft reach cruising altitude faster than larger, heavier ones, which need to burn fuel, thereby decreasing their weight, before reaching maximum altitudes. </p><p>The barometric pressure inside the aircraft cabin drops from a normal sea level value of 760 mmHg to approximately 560 mmHg during flight. As a result, the PaO2 in normal individuals drops from a baseline of around 70 to 95 mmHg at sea level to a PaO2 of 50 to 60 mmHg inside a cabin pressurized at 8000 feet (2500 m) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one study, the oxygen saturations of healthy passengers were measured and showed a decline from 99 percent before takeoff to 94 percent during flight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This drop in arterial blood oxygen saturation occurs along the flat portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve and is usually not noticeable to healthy adults at rest during a flight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Passengers may respond to this relatively hypoxic environment by increasing their heart rate, cardiac output, respiratory rate, and respiratory volume. Some may experience mild fatigue. However, in individuals with cardiopulmonary disease compensation can be insufficient. For them, a relatively small drop in oxygen saturation can occur on the steep part of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, severely compromising their cardiopulmonary reserves and precipitating a medical emergency, such as cardiac ischemia or respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/2,25,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25,27,28</a>]. The relative hypoxia can also trigger complications in passengers with sickle cell disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced air pressure and potential complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Boyle's Law (P x V = P' x V') explains how a set amount of air trapped in a container or hollow viscus will expand to occupy more space at a lower barometric pressure. The diminished air pressure during flight at 8000 feet (2500 m) can lead to the expansion of gas up to 30 percent compared with sea level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/2,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29</a>]. A medical emergency can ensue if the expanding gas is constrained within a confined space such as the pleural cavity, the middle ear, sinuses, a medical device, or another body cavity after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Most passengers have experienced discomfort due to expanded air in the middle ear that develops when the aircraft climbs rapidly after takeoff to achieve cruising altitude or during descent prior to landing. Usually, such discomfort is self-limited as air spontaneously moves to or from the middle-ear via the Eustachian tube, re-equilibrating internal and external pressures across the tympanic membrane. Travelers can help equilibrate pressures by yawning or by performing a Frenzel or mild Valsalva maneuver. Chewing gum and frequent swallowing, or for infants a bottle or pacifier to suck on, during ascent and descent can limit discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Failure to equilibrate pressures in the middle ear (barotitis media) or paranasal sinuses (barosinusitis) can cause pain, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss, and rupture of the tympanic membrane. The change in barometric pressure can also cause a toothache (barodontalgia) in those with dental disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-barotrauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ear barotrauma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-scuba-diving#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of SCUBA diving&quot;, section on 'Dental barotrauma'</a>.)</p><p>Pneumothorax is a less common but more dangerous potential complication of changes in air pressure. Expansion of trapped gas in the lungs can cause a pneumothorax during flight, especially in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or recent thoracic surgery. A small untreated pneumothorax can expand substantially at altitude. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumothorax-and-air-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumothorax and air travel&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Increased pressure can develop within hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract and may cause abdominal distention, pain, and nausea. Expanding intestinal gas may cause dehiscence of surgical wounds, hemorrhage, or bowel perforation in air travelers with recent abdominal surgery complicated by ileus or those with small or large bowel obstruction. In addition, passengers with recent central nervous system or ophthalmologic surgery may be susceptible to problems associated with the expansion of trapped gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, following retinal surgery gas is injected into the ocular globe, and sight-threatening complications may ensue from increased intraocular pressure should such gas expand to a sufficient degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Gas expansion can also affect medical devices with pneumatic components, for example, urinary catheters, feeding tubes, pneumatic splints, and the air-filled cuffs of tracheostomy tubes. Instilling saline solution or water instead of air may avert some problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, tracheal tube cuff pressures can be difficult to manage, and it is likely best to check these during and following a flight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Releasing air from inflatable devices may reduce overexpansion, which could cause local trauma or rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>]. Some insulin pumps may be susceptible to changes in delivery rate due to the expansion of small air bubbles within the device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) do not appear to be harmed by the cabin environment, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Air quality</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4234170371\"><span class=\"h3\">Low cabin humidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cabin air is very dry, usually between 10 and 20 percent humidity; optimal humidity ranges from 40 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>]. Low humidity can dry the skin, corneas, and airway passages, triggering respiratory problems, especially in patients with asthma or COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/2,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,36</a>]. Insensible water loss in the desiccated cabin environment, combined with diminished fluid intake during a long flight, can cause discomfort but typically is not sufficient to cause clinically significant dehydration in an otherwise healthy adult. Low humidity can contribute to thick mucus in patients with tracheostomy tubes or transtracheal oxygen catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Transmission of airborne pathogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A commercial aircraft's air conditioning and ventilation system (using high-efficiency particulate air filters) is able to maintain low bacteria, fungi, and viral counts in the cabin. However, there are reports of individuals possibly contracting a number of infectious diseases through airborne transmission during commercial flights, including tuberculosis, influenza, measles, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/25,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,37-39</a>]. Risk of infection appears to be greatest on flights longer than eight hours and among passengers seated within two rows of the infected passenger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Nevertheless, some reports describe possible in-flight transmission during SARS epidemics to passengers seated far from the index passenger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It is possible that transmission may have occurred before or after the flight when passengers may be close to one other while on line for boarding, using the bathroom, or awaiting security or immigration checks. Rarely, if ever, do such infections create acute management problems during flight, as the incubation period is longer than the duration of the trip. (See <a href=\"#H4056953295\" class=\"local\">'Infectious disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">General environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aside from cabin air, the general environment of an aircraft during flight can contribute to a number of medical issues. Airplanes are noisy and subject passengers to significant vibration and turbulence. Turbulence in turn can precipitate motion sickness, and falling overhead items can cause significant head trauma and other injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Traveling long distances disturbs circadian rhythms and possibly disrupts patients' medication schedules. Food poisoning can occur during flight or symptoms may begin in-flight.

In general, such emergencies are addressed in the following manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/10,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cabin crew is notified of a possible medical emergency and makes an initial assessment of the situation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Captain is informed of the situation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crew solicits assistance from on-board medical professionals as needed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Captain calls for ground-based medical support (GBMS) as needed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based on assessment of passenger's condition, the captain determines course of action, which may include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No change in flight plan, but request for medical personnel to meet the flight upon arrival</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Expedited landing at intended destination </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diversion to a closer location</p><p/><p>Regardless of the source of medical support, the captain remains the ultimate decision maker for any commercial aircraft under all circumstances. Any medical advice, whether from ground or on-board medical professionals, is exactly that &mdash; advice. In making decisions, the captain must consider a host of factors, including weather conditions, turbulence, air traffic, approach charts, runway length, landing weight of the airplane, and proximity to appropriate ground medical facilities. Even under ideal conditions, the captain and crew require at least 20 minutes to land an aircraft.</p><p>The role of the volunteer medical professional is to assist the flight crew with the medical problem, not to take control. Ideally, the clinician and GBMS personnel work together to manage problems. GBMS staff are knowledgeable about the resources available to manage inflight emergencies and can make informed recommendations about aircraft diversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, such interactions may of necessity be indirect, as it is not always possible to establish direct communications in aircraft where communication lines are limited to the cockpit, to which access is restricted out of security concerns. In some airlines, ground communication is available in the passenger cabin. Using GBMS frequently alleviates the pressure felt by a volunteer clinician trying to manage a passenger in unfamiliar and sometimes difficult circumstances.</p><p>Many inflight medical problems are relatively minor, and do not require major interventions or changes in the flight plan. In addition, GBMS is available for virtually all major United States airlines and most international airlines. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES ON BOARD AN AIRCRAFT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is the United Nations agency in charge of standards and recommended practices for commercial aviation. The ICAO calls for three types of medical kits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First Aid Kit (FAK) &ndash; The number of FAKs required is proportional to the number of seats in the aircraft. The standard ratio is one FAK for every 100 seats. Although the contents of the FAK are primarily for wound care, some countries include non-prescription medications as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency Medical Kit (EMK) &ndash;The recommended practice of the ICAO is for aircraft authorized to transport more than 100 passengers for flights over two hours to carry a medical kit for the use of medical doctors or other qualified persons in treating in-flight medical emergencies. The EMK contains medications and is opened under the responsibility of a qualified health care practitioner. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Universal Precaution Kit (UPK) &ndash; The UPK contains personal protection equipment for crew members and volunteer health professionals who may be exposed to a communicable disease.</p><p/><p>The medications listed by ICAO for inclusion in the EMK are not standard or recommended practice, but guidelines only. Each ICAO member state may regulate the contents of the EMK. In addition, individual airlines are at liberty to enhance the medical resources available on their aircraft. As a result, there is significant variation in the content of medical kits across the airline industry worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>According to the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): &quot;Flight attendants should grant access to the equipment only to trained crewmembers or to other persons qualified and trained in the use of emergency medical equipment. The decision to allow passengers to assist another passenger and have access to medical equipment is up to the air carrier and its agents.&quot; The FAA does not define the various medical specialties because this might deny access to the only person available to assist with a medical emergency. </p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) states that the captain should control access to the EMK. Drugs should be administered by medical doctors, qualified nurses and physician assistants, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, or other qualified health care practitioners. However, medical students, paramedic students, emergency medical technician students, and nurse aids may administer drugs if no other qualified health care professional is aboard the flight and appropriate advice has been received from GBMS. Even so, according to EASA, oral medications should not be denied in medical emergencies even if no medically qualified persons are present. </p><p>The FAA requires passenger-carrying aircraft weighing more than 7500 pounds (3400 kg) maximum capacity with at least one flight attendant to carry an enhanced EMK with specified contents. This is in addition to a basic first aid kit, which contains bandages, compresses, antiseptic swabs, arm and leg splints, tape and scissors, and ammonia inhalants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/2,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,44</a>].

A large proportion of episodes of sudden cardiac arrest in out-of-hospital public settings are caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF). VF can only be treated effectively with defibrillation, and time is critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

In one report of inflight AED use, the device was used in 40 of 169 cases to treat cardiac arrest with the remainder for cardiac monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-external-defibrillators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated external defibrillators&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Large prospective observational studies have shown that defibrillation with an AED substantially improves the chances of survival to discharge compared with CPR alone. If a cardiac arrest occurs during flight, at least 20 minutes will pass until defibrillation is possible, unless AEDs are available aboard the aircraft. An observational study that examined the use of AEDs in one airline over two years found that AEDs successfully shocked 13 of 14 patients in VF, of whom 40 percent survived to hospital discharge. Another study documented defibrillation in 9 of 10 patients whose initial rhythm was VF or unstable ventricular tachycardia, of whom five survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Another research group extrapolated arrest and resuscitation rates to worldwide air travel and estimated that of the 452 passengers who would sustain VF arrests inflight, 93 would live (21 percent) if an AED were available and used appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Passengers traveling with a POC should be advised that the demand for oxygen is higher inflight due to the lower oxygen pressure within the cabin. Therefore, a higher flow rate is needed for the POC.

However, regardless of the quality of the device, stethoscopes are generally of limited use for auscultating the heart during flight due to the background noise of the engines. A health care practitioner can attempt to measure the blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer but may be forced to approximate the blood pressure using palpation, although the accuracy of this method is limited.</p><p>Some international aircraft have electronic blood pressure cuffs, pulse oximeters, and glucometers in their emergency medical kits (EMKs), and some carry advanced automated external defibrillators (AEDs) with a screen that can be used to determine the cardiac rhythm. However, this is an &quot;off label&quot; use of the AED. In addition, the decision to use disposable electrodes for this purpose should be weighed carefully as these electrodes may be needed in the case of a true cardiac arrest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-external-defibrillators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated external defibrillators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A few airlines carry more sophisticated monitoring devices capable of transmitting medical data from the aircraft to ground-based support physicians.

In contrast to cases of SCA that occur in airports, where ventricular fibrillation is the presenting arrhythmia for the majority of cases (87 percent in one small sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]), approximately 25 percent of inflight cases present with a shockable arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The most likely explanation is slower recognition because the passenger's collapse is unwitnessed during flight (occurs while the passenger is seated or in the lavatory), delaying recognition and intervention. </p><p>The best approach to managing a SCA inflight is to follow the protocols of basic life support (BLS). Most aircraft lack the equipment, medications, and medical support to provide complete advanced life support, although such measures should be performed as indicated when possible.

If symptomatic, the infected individual must be cared for, while the risks posed to other passengers and the community at large must be managed. New and reemerging infectious diseases can be spread internationally via air transport. As the speed of travel is faster than the incubation period for many infectious diseases, pre-flight recognition of such infections is often extremely difficult. It is not unusual for travelers to try to return to their home country, and to disguise their condition, if an infectious disease is discovered while they are abroad.

This may involve moving surrounding passengers to other seats and using standard precautions, such as gloves and masks. Commercial airlines carry a Universal Precaution Kit (UPK) that contains the equipment used for basic &quot;universal&quot; precautions, including gowns, goggles, masks, and sanitizers.

They impose an obligation on physicians to render aid; if aid is not provided, the physician can be punished by a fine or imprisonment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/69,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Legal guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for avoiding legal complications include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain passenger consent whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use an interpreter if necessary and available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask whether ground-based medical support is available to help you, particularly if the situation falls beyond your medical specialty or skill set.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommend diversion to the closest appropriate airport for any serious condition (remember that the captain is not obligated to follow your recommendation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Document the following in writing: history, examination, impression, treatment, and communication with crew and ground medical support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be cautious with unfamiliar interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/25,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not accept or request financial compensation for any medical assistance provided.

An intoxicated or impaired medical provider is at risk of being categorized as engaging in &quot;gross negligence and willful misconduct.&quot; As such, not only might you harm the patient, but you would not be covered under the AMAA Good Samaritan Law.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good Samaritan laws apply to in-flight medical emergencies. They do not apply to non-emergency medical advice that you may provide.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of inflight medical emergencies and non-emergency events is increasing in proportion with the general increase in air travel worldwide, although the precise incidence is unknown. Cardiac, neurologic, and respiratory complaints comprise the more serious emergencies, as defined by aircraft diversion or use of ground-based medical support (GBMS) assistance. Of these, cardiac emergencies are most common. Most medical events during flight are not emergencies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aircraft cabin is pressurized typically to the equivalent of 4000 to 8000 feet (1400 to 2500 m) above sea level. In individuals with cardiopulmonary disease, the ability to compensate for this relatively hypoxic environment may be insufficient. For them, a relatively small drop in oxygen saturation may occur on the steep part of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, severely compromising their cardiopulmonary reserves, and precipitating a medical emergency such as cardiac ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cabin environment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished cabin air pressure during flight can lead to the expansion of gas up to 30 percent compared with sea level. A medical emergency can ensue if the expanding gas is constrained within a confined space such as the pleural cavity (pneumothorax), the middle ear (tympanic membrane rupture), or another body cavity after surgery. Gas expansion can also create problems with inflated medical devices, such as tracheostomy cuffs, gastric feeding tubes, bladder catheters, and insulin pumps. The low humidity of cabin air can exacerbate pulmonary problems such as asthma and may predispose some passengers to dehydration. Turbulence can cause head trauma and other injuries. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cabin environment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each airline has its own medical emergency protocol. Under all circumstances, the captain remains the ultimate decision maker for any commercial aircraft. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Airline protocols for managing medical emergencies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major commercial aircraft carry three types of kits: a First Aid Kit (FAK), a Universal Precaution Kit (UPK), and the Emergency Medical Kit (EMK). The EMK contains specified equipment (eg, sphygmomanometer, stethoscope) and medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, nitrates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, bronchodilators, dextrose) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53375 \">table 2</a>). Most international airlines carry automated external defibrillators (AED), and oxygen is available. GBMS from physicians with expertise in managing inflight medical emergencies is readily available on most flights. The sick passenger or other passengers aboard may have useful medications and medical equipment, although medications from the EMK are preferred. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Resources on board an aircraft'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac complaints comprise about 20 percent of inflight medical emergencies, and in most studies are the most common cause of aircraft diversion and passenger death. Chest pain and angina are most common. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a>, nitrates, and oxygen are available for treatment. In addition to defibrillation, AEDs can be used to assess a patient's cardiac rhythm. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Common inflight medical emergencies and complaints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope, seizure, and dizziness are the most common neurologic emergencies. Treatment options are limited, and care is generally supportive. Intravenous (IV) normal saline and dextrose are available. Some airlines include an injectable benzodiazepine in their EMK. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Common inflight medical emergencies and complaints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory events, mainly asthma and COPD exacerbations, comprise about 5 to 15 percent of diversions and represent the second greatest number of deaths. Available treatments include: oxygen, bronchodilators either in the EMK or from other passengers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, injectable glucocorticoids in some EMKs, and oral and endotracheal airways with bag mask ventilation devices. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Common inflight medical emergencies and complaints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain and nausea are common aboard aircraft, but they are rarely medical emergencies. Other emergencies, such as allergic and hypoglycemic reactions can occur. Basic equipment and medications are available for management. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Common inflight medical emergencies and complaints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor trauma and behavioral problems occurs with some frequency aboard commercial air flights. These are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Head injury and other trauma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral problems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During flight, contact with passengers who may pose a risk of transmitting a serious infection should be restricted to the greatest extent possible as soon as the risk is identified. Passengers with fever (temperature <span class=\"nowrap\">38&deg;C/100&deg;F</span> or greater) associated with other concerning clinical findings represent reportable cases in most countries. (See <a href=\"#H4056953295\" class=\"local\">'Infectious disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians who come to the assistance of passengers aboard aircraft are protected from liability in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain by Good Samaritan legislation. According to the laws of France, Germany, and other European nations, physicians are obligated to provide aid when it is requested by the crew. Guidelines to help avoid legal pitfalls are included above. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Liability and legal protection for Good Samaritans'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2662574634\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Matthew Prout, MD, Jeffrey Pine, MD, and Paul Alves, MD, all of whom contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sirven JI, Claypool DW, Sahs KL, et al.
