Closed reduction and casting for distal forearm fractures in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-reduction-and-casting-of-distal-forearm-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closed reduction and casting of distal forearm fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3982546542\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splinting plays a major role in the management of musculoskeletal injuries, including treatment of overuse and soft tissue injuries (eg, tendonitis and sprains), as well as for traumatic injuries like extremity fractures and joint dislocations. Immobilization of the extremity through splinting may serve to decrease pain and bleeding, and prevent further soft tissue, vascular, or neurologic compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Splinting may also provide definitive treatment for some injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Compared with casts, splints permit swelling and may prevent neurovascular compromise. Timely splinting as soon as possible after the injury is recommended in most cases. Close attention to detail and familiarization with proper splinting technique can increase patient comfort and decrease the likelihood of further injury.</p><p>However, preliminary evidence suggests that many splints are applied incorrectly with the potential for causing unnecessary injury. As an example, in a prospective, observational study that evaluated 275 splints applied for pediatric fractures in emergency departments or urgent care centers, 93 percent were deemed to have been applied incorrectly, with 77 percent of the splints having the application of the elastic bandage directly to the skin, 59 percent noted to have improper positioning, and 52 percent with an inappropriate splint length, most commonly too long and not permitting free range of motion at the metacarpal joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Skin or soft tissue complications occurred in 40 percent of patients; excessive swelling was most frequent (28 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splints have traditionally been made of plaster of Paris, but in recent years many different types of splinting materials have become available. These include pre-formed plaster, fiberglass, pre-padded fiberglass, malleable aluminium, air splints, vacuum splints, and pre-formed &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; splints for nearly every body part.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576000\"><span class=\"h2\">Preformed splints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice between pre-formed splints and custom splints is largely one of convenience and compliance. </p><p>Commercial pre-formed splints are typically made of Velcro and hard plastic. They are very convenient and come in a variety of sizes to fit most patients. However, since these splints are not custom-molded, they do not provide the same level of immobilization as custom built splints. Additionally, patients can easily remove commercial splints, potentially causing delayed healing, fracture displacement, or re-injury. Hence, custom splinting with plaster, fiberglass, or similar materials may be preferred when precise and continuous immobilization is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576007\"><span class=\"h2\">Manufactured splints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The equipment necessary for the application of a manufactured splint includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cotton bandage (eg, Webril) for padding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaster slabs or rolls or pre-padded fiberglass splint material (eg, OCL and Orthoglass) of various widths (2, 3, 4, and 6 inches [5, 7.5, 10, and 15 cm])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Room temperature water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elastic bandage (eg, Ace bandage)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesive tape</p><p/><p>Most splints are made from plaster or fiberglass. Plaster splints are made from gauze that is impregnated with plaster of Paris, a powdered form of gypsum. When water is added, the gypsum recrystallizes and hardens in a heat-releasing reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. To minimize the risk of burns, use water that is no warmer than room temperature. Plaster splints take between 2 and 8 minutes to set, but they do not reach their maximum strength for approximately 24 hours. Plaster splints are easier to mold and are less expensive than fiberglass splints. However, they are more difficult to apply and become soggy when wet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Fiberglass and other synthetic splints (eg, Orthoglass, OCL, and Velcro splints) usually are pre-padded and easier to apply. In addition, synthetic splints set more quickly and are lighter and longer-wearing, and are water-resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/3-5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,12</a>]. However, they are more expensive and do not mold as well as plaster splints.</p><p>More sophisticated prefabricated splints, consisting of plastic shells lined with air cells, foam, or gel components, are widely available. These splints are often used for soft tissue injuries or bony injuries that require prolonged periods of immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Air splints (also called air casts) provide less support than plaster or fiberglass splints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78043\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78043 \">picture 1</a>). They can be used to treat ankle sprains and low-risk fractures of the distal fibular physis (ie, Salter-Harris Type I fractures of the distal fibula). Air splints prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">eversion/inversion</span> movement while permitting free <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension</span>. Furthermore, the amount of air in the splint can be increased as swelling resolves in order to maintain support during healing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advise field personnel to splint injuries suspected to be fractures before the patient is transported for medical evaluation. Commercial splinting devices are available and easy to use. If commercial devices are unavailable field personnel can manufacture splints from other available, malleable, semi-rigid material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The following techniques apply to splinting applied by medical personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/1-6,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6,12,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide pain control, as needed, prior to splinting. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ibuprofen</a> provides reasonable pain control for many injuries. Patients with significant pain require opioids (eg, intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess the full extent of the injury and obtain adequate exposure for splint application. Obtain emergent orthopedic surgery evaluation for open, angulated, or displaced fractures; dislocations that cannot be reduced; or neurovascular compromise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expose the extremity completely before the splint is applied. Clean, repair, and dress skin lesions before applying the splint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take into account the patient's ability to remove his or her clothing with the splint in place before applying the splint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure adequate and comfortable immobilization:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Make sure that splints are of appropriate size, weight, and shape. In children, make the plaster or fiberglass slab wide enough to cover approximately one-half of the circumference of the extremity in children; do not allow the edges to overlap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In adults, use 2 inch splinting material for finger splints; 3 and 4 inch widths for upper extremity splints; and 5 to 6 inch widths for lower extremity splinting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prevention of skin breakdown by the use of proper padding is vitally important. Pad the heels, elbows, and all bony prominences adequately; place padding between the digits to prevent maceration; place extra padding over the fracture site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immobilize the joints above and below a fracture unless this is not possible (such as for distal fractures below the elbow or knee).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For a dislocated joint, immobilize the bones above and below a dislocated joint unless this is not possible (such as for distal fractures below the elbow or knee).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To prevent stiffness and loss of function, splint the involved joints in their positions of function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51226\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51226 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the hand, splint in the position of safety, which differs from the position of function, by extending the wrist 20 degrees, flex the metacarpophalangeal joints 90 degrees, and fully extend the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60552\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60552 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Never splint fractures circumferentially, particularly if the patient has impaired sensation, significant swelling, or circulatory insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/3-5,7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,7,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evaluate neurovascular status before and after application of the splint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provide slings for added support or crutches to prevent weightbearing or use of the extremity. These activities may increase pain or swelling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cause the splint to break [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most children can learn to use crutches by the time they are six to seven years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide aftercare instructions and ensure adequate follow-up:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Instruct the patient to return to the physician for evaluation of any numbness, tingling, or increased pain in the area underneath or distal to the splint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To minimize swelling, ask the patient to keep the extremity elevated, iced, and rested until reevaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/3-7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7,14</a>]. Ice is effective through the layers of Webril and Ace wrap in an area that is not covered with <span class=\"nowrap\">plaster/fiberglass</span>. To ice the splinted extremity, place a bag of ice (or frozen vegetables) on the outside of the splint for 20 minutes. A longer duration may numb the extremity, and a shorter one may not markedly affect swelling. Place a layer of cloth or towel under the ice if the bag is too cold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Check splints 24 to 48 hours after application to ensure adequate fit and neurovascular integrity, evaluating for the five Ps (<strong>p</strong>allor, <strong>p</strong>ain, <strong>p</strong>aresthesia, <strong>p</strong>ulselessness, and <strong>p</strong>aralysis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Make sure that there is another evaluation, usually performed by an orthopedist, 7 to 10 days after injury. By this time, swelling usually has resolved and a cast can be applied if one is indicated. A cast provides longer lasting support and immobilization for the treatment of fractures. Initiate physical therapy (if indicated) after splinting, so as to prevent &quot;freezing&quot; or contracture of the joints.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS OF SPLINTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications rarely occur when splints are applied correctly and maintained properly by the patient. </p><p>Complications include sores, abrasions, and infections from loose or ill-fitting splints; neurovascular compromise from tight-fitting splints; contact dermatitis; pressure sores; and thermal burns (from heat released during setting of plaster) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/1,2,12,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,12,13,16</a>]. Most of these complications can be avoided through careful application of the splint and monitoring of the patient's neurovascular status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SPLINT APPLICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of splint varies depending upon the site of the injury. The most basic splint is composed of a layer of stockinette, with or without padding, and several layers of plaster (or pre-padded fiberglass) that are molded to provide comfort, support, and immobilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59847\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59847 \">picture 2</a>). Wrap additional padding for bulk and a final layer of cotton or elastic bandage around the plaster or fiberglass to hold everything in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/1,3-7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-7,13</a>]. Do not wrap the final layer too tightly. Secure the bandage with tape rather than pins to prevent injuries from pins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Customized plaster splints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Customized plaster splints may be manufactured to remain in place or to be removable.</p><p>The application of plaster splints designed to remain in place requires the following steps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the optional stockinette is to be used, stretch and smooth it over the extremity; extend the stockinette beyond the proximal and distal edges of the area to be splinted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrap cotton bandage (eg, Webril) around the extremity in a distal to proximal fashion; overlap each turn to cover the previous one by 50 percent. Be careful to avoid wrinkles because they can create pressure points. Extend the padding 2 to 3 cm beyond the area to be splinted. If stockinette has been used, extend it beyond the proximal and distal edges of the cotton bandage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure the plaster strips and cut to length. Cut the strips slightly longer than necessary so they can be folded back on themselves to create a smooth edge and to permit contraction of the plaster as it crystallizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Use approximately 8 to 10 layers for an upper extremity splint and 12 to 14 layers for a lower extremity splint. The risk of thermal injury is directly related to the number of plaster layers and the adequacy of padding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immerse the plaster in water at room-temperature and then place it on an open towel to remove excess water and smooth the plaster.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply the plaster to the extremity, molding it to the extremity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before the plaster hardens, fold back the proximal and distal ends over themselves to form a smooth edge; if stockinette was used, fold it over the edge of the plaster.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply an (optional) layer of cast padding over the splint to prevent the plaster from sticking to the elastic bandage of the final layer or apply the elastic bandage (Ace wrap) directly to the splint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrap an elastic bandage around the extremity, distal to proximal, to secure the plaster to the extremity.

In the case of sports-induced hand injuries, the athlete may be able to complete the athletic season with appropriate casting and splinting measures to ensure protection of the injured player and the other competitors without causing loss of game time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Sling and swathe splint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use the sling and swathe splint primarily for shoulder and humeral injuries. The sling supports the weight of the arm and the swathe holds the arm against the chest to minimize shoulder motion. Commercial models are available, but a simple sling with a 6 inch elastic bandage will do.

Use it for fractures of the second to fifth metacarpals and distal forearm and wrist fractures as an alternative to the distal or reverse sugar tong splints. The reverse sugar tong splint offers more dorsal and ventral support and is used more often in younger children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Dorsal and/or volar splint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use the dorsal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volar short arm splint for carpal tunnel syndrome, soft tissue injuries of the hand, and fractures or injuries of the wrist.

Immobilization of the extremity through splinting decreases pain and bleeding and prevents further soft tissue, vascular, or neurologic compromise. Protective splinting of upper extremity injuries may enable athletes to return to sport while in season, deferring definitive treatment until after the season. Splinting may provide definitive treatment for some injuries. (See <a href=\"#H3982546542\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to splint application, the clinician should assess for neurovascular compromise and other findings that indicate the need for prompt referral to an orthopedic surgeon (eg, displaced fracture, open fracture). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Basic techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splints should typically maintain joints in the position of function, or for finger splints, the position of safety (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51226\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51226 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60552\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60552 \">figure 1</a>). For most fractures, the splint should immobilize the joint above and the joint below the fractured bone. For most dislocations, the splint should immobilize the bone above and the bone below the reduced joint. Proper padding, correct sizing of splint materials, and reassessment of neurovascular status are important to prevent complications from splinting. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Basic techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tables provide potential indications for specific upper and lower extremity splints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55110 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53065\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53065 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Upper extremity splints'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Lower extremity splints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaster splints are made from gauze that is impregnated with plaster of Paris, a powdered form of gypsum. When water is added, the gypsum recrystallizes and hardens in a heat-releasing reaction. To minimize the risk of burns, use water that is no warmer than room temperature. Plaster splints take between 2 and 8 minutes to set, but they do not reach their maximum strength for approximately 24 hours. Plaster splints are easier to mold and are less expensive than fiberglass splints. However, they are more difficult to apply and become soggy when wet. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Customized plaster splints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fiberglass and other synthetic splints (eg, Orthoglass, OCL, and Velcro splints) usually are already padded and easier to apply. In addition, synthetic splints set more quickly and are lighter, longer-wearing, and water-resistant. However, they are more expensive and do not mold as well as plaster splints.
