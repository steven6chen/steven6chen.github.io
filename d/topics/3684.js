Each of these categories can be divided into subtypes that have somewhat different causes, clinical pictures, clinical courses, outcomes, and treatment strategies. As an example, intracranial hemorrhage can be caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), also called parenchymal hemorrhage, which involves bleeding directly into brain tissue, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which involves bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the categories of stroke and their clinical diagnosis. An overview of the evaluation of stroke and the clinical manifestations of transient cerebral ischemia are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, classification, and epidemiology of stroke&quot;</a>.) The subtypes are reviewed here briefly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracerebral hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is usually derived from arterioles or small arteries. The bleeding is directly into the brain, forming a localized hematoma that spreads along white matter pathways. Accumulation of blood occurs over minutes or hours and the neurologic symptoms usually increase gradually over minutes or a few hours. In contrast to brain embolism and SAH, the neurologic symptoms do not begin abruptly and are not maximal at onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61491 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Subarachnoid hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture of an aneurysm releases blood directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) under arterial pressure. The blood spreads quickly within the CSF, rapidly increasing intracranial pressure. Death or deep coma ensues if the bleeding continues. The bleeding usually lasts only a few seconds but rebleeding is very common. With causes of SAH other than aneurysm rupture, the bleeding is less abrupt and may continue over a longer period of time.</p><p>Symptoms of SAH begin abruptly in contrast to the more gradual onset of ICH. The sudden increase in pressure causes a cessation of activity (eg, loss of memory or focus or knees buckling). Headache is an invariable symptom and is typically instantly severe and widespread. There are usually no important focal neurologic signs unless bleeding occurs into the brain and CSF at the same time (meningocerebral hemorrhage).</p><p>Onset headache is more common in SAH than in ICH, whereas the combination of onset headache and vomiting is infrequent in ischemic stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60831 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three main subtypes of brain ischemia are thrombosis, embolism, and hypoperfusion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis generally refers to local in situ obstruction of an artery. The obstruction may be due to disease of the arterial wall, such as arteriosclerosis, dissection, or fibromuscular dysplasia; there may or may not be superimposed thrombosis. Thrombotic strokes can be divided into either large or small vessel disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55099 \">table 1</a>). These two subtypes of thrombosis are worth distinguishing since the causes, outcomes, and treatments are different. Atherosclerosis is by far the most common cause of in situ local disease within the large extracranial and intracranial arteries that supply the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with thrombosis, the neurologic symptoms often fluctuate, remit, or progress in a stuttering fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64107 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolism refers to particles of debris originating elsewhere that block arterial access to a particular brain region. Embolic strokes may arise from a source in the heart, aorta, or large vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55099 \">table 1</a>). The embolus suddenly blocks the recipient site so that the onset of symptoms is abrupt and usually maximal at the start (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73261\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73261 \">figure 4</a>). Unlike thrombosis, multiple sites within different vascular territories may be affected when the source is the heart (eg, left atrial appendage or left ventricular thrombus) or aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic hypoperfusion is a more general circulatory problem, manifesting itself in the brain and perhaps other organs. Reduced cerebral blood flow is more global in patients with systemic hypoperfusion and does not affect isolated regions. Symptoms of brain dysfunction typically are diffuse and <strong>nonfocal</strong> in contrast to the other two categories of ischemia. The neurologic signs are typically bilateral, although they may be asymmetric when there is preexisting asymmetrical craniocerebral vascular occlusive disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTINGUISHING STROKE SUBTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many features of the history and physical examination suggest certain stroke subtypes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69907\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69907 \">table 2</a>). This presumptive clinical diagnosis requires confirmation by brain and vascular imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important historical item for differentiating stroke subtypes is the pace and course of the symptoms and signs and their clearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Each subtype has a characteristic course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracerebral hemorrhage does not improve during the early period; it progresses gradually during minutes or a few hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61491 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolic strokes most often occur suddenly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73261\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73261 \">figure 4</a>). The deficits indicate focal loss of brain function that is usually maximal at onset. Rapid recovery also favors embolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis-related symptoms often fluctuate, varying between normal and abnormal or progressing in a stepwise or stuttering fashion with some periods of improvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64107 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penetrating artery occlusions usually cause symptoms that develop during a short period of time, hours or at most a few days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52246 \">figure 5</a>), compared with large artery-related brain ischemia, which can evolve over a longer period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aneurysmal SAH develops in an instant. Focal brain dysfunction is less common.</p><p/><p>Patients often do not give a specific history regarding the course of neurologic symptoms. I often ask if the patient could walk, talk, use the phone, use the hand, etc, as the events developed after the first symptoms occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Neurologic worsening after acute ischemic stroke is not uncommon. In a large prospective study, neurologic deterioration during the acute phase (48 to 72 hours from onset) of cerebral ischemia occurred in 256 (13 percent) of 1964 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Deterioration was related mainly to progressive infarction, increased intracranial pressure, recurrent cerebral ischemia, and secondary parenchymal hemorrhage. Independent predictors of neurologic deterioration included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brainstem infarction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment occlusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Territorial infarction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ecology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ecology refers to known demographic and historical features that provide probabilities of the patient having one or more of the stroke subtypes. The presence of these risk factors increase the odds that a stroke is due to a particular mechanism, but the clinician cannot make a firm diagnosis simply on the basis of probability.</p><p>As examples: some conditions such as hypertension predispose to more than one subtype (thrombosis, ICH); the presence of a prior myocardial infarction increases the likelihood of cardiac origin embolism, but also increases the likelihood of carotid and vertebral artery neck occlusive disease (thrombosis); and an older patient with severe atherosclerosis may also harbor an unexpected cerebral aneurysm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Age, gender, and race</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age, gender, and race are important demographic variables known to the clinician before taking the history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most thrombotic and embolic strokes related to atherosclerosis occur in older patients. Individuals under age 40 rarely have severe atherosclerosis unless they also have important risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, or a strong family history. In contrast, hemorrhages (both ICH and SAH) are common in adolescents and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cardiac-origin embolism is also common in young people who are known to have heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertensive ICH is more common among blacks and individuals of Asian descent than among whites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premenopausal women have a lower frequency of atherosclerosis than men of similar age unless they have major stroke risk factors.

Of these, atrial fibrillation is the most prominent, causing nearly half of all cardioembolic strokes.

Epidemiologic studies show that there is a gradually increasing incidence of both coronary disease and stroke as the blood pressure rises above <span class=\"nowrap\">110/75</span> mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66793\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66793 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. Both prior blood pressure and current blood pressure are important risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, these observations do not prove a causal relationship, since increasing blood pressure could be a marker for other risk factors such as increasing body weight, which is associated with dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and the metabolic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The best evidence for a causal role of increasing blood pressure in cardiovascular complications is an improvement in outcome with antihypertensive therapy. An overview of 14 hypertension treatment trials concluded that a long-term (mean five years) 5 to 6 mmHg decrease in the usual diastolic blood pressure was associated with a 35 to 40 percent reduction in stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Severe uncontrolled hypertension is a strong risk factor for ICH. A young person who enters the hospital with the acute onset of a focal neurologic deficit and a blood pressure greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">220/120</span> mmHg has a high likelihood of having an ICH.

For blood pressures <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;180/&ge;110</span> mmHg, the difference in relative risk was even more pronounced between hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke subtypes (28.83 versus 9.56).</p><p>Chronic hypertension is a risk factor for both thrombotic extracranial and intracranial large artery disease and penetrating artery disease.

Large hemispheric infarcts are typically followed by edema that can progress to coma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Silent brain infarcts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Silent brain infarcts are infarcts identified only by neuroimaging. There is no accompanying clinical history of stroke or TIA. However, this relationship is somewhat clouded because a more detailed history may elicit symptoms to suggest that a lesion is not truly silent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, these lesions seem to be associated with cognitive deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Therefore, it is more appropriate to refer to these clinically unrecognized lesions as <strong>covert</strong> brain infarcts.</p><p>Patients with TIA and minor stroke appear to have a high risk of covert infarcts as well as clinically symptomatic infarcts. This point is illustrated by a study of 143 hospital patients with TIA or minor stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. On follow-up at 30 days, the risk of new ischemic lesions on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging or FLAIR sequences was about 10 percent, and nearly half of these new lesions were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Covert brain infarction may be much more common than symptomatic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a population-based cross-sectional survey of 267 elderly community residents in Germany, the prevalence of silent stroke was 12.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]; the presence of silent stroke was associated with diminished cognitive performance in the domain of procedural speed. Patients with severe atherosclerotic disease may have silent infarcts at younger ages than those without such disease burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In the Cardiovascular Health Study, 1433 participants with no brain infarcts on a baseline head MRI scan had a repeat head MRI at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. One or more infarcts were detected in 18 percent of subjects, and these MRI defined infarcts were typically:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single infarcts (76 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small (3 to 20 mm in 87 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcortical (80 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Without acute symptoms recognized as a TIA or stroke (89 percent)</p><p/><p>Furthermore, these covert infarcts were associated with subtle cognitive change. Subjects with MRI defined infarcts had a significantly greater decline on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit Symbol Substitution test than those without infarcts at follow-up. The severity of white matter changes on initial MRI was the strongest predictor of new infarcts.</p><p>Covert infarcts may have important prognostic implications for stroke risk and cognitive decline. In the Rotterdam Scan Study, patients with silent brain infarcts were at significantly increased risk for subsequent stroke (adjusted hazard ratio 3.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Patients with more than one silent infarct were at higher risk than those with one silent infarct, and patients with more white matter lesions were also at increased risk for subsequent stroke. In another report from the Rotterdam Scan Study, the presence of silent brain infarcts significantly increased the risk of dementia (hazard ratio 2.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The presence of silent brain infarcts on the baseline MRI was associated with decreased performance on neuropsychological tests and a steeper decline in global cognitive function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">General physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important clues in the general physical examination include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absent pulses (inferior extremity, radial, or carotid) favors a diagnosis of atherosclerosis with thrombosis, although the sudden onset of a cold, blue limb favors embolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The internal carotid arteries in the neck cannot be reliably palpated but, in some patients, occlusion of the common carotid artery in the neck can be diagnosed by the absence of a carotid pulse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a neck bruit suggests the presence of occlusive extracranial disease, especially if the bruit is long, focal, and high pitched.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpating the facial pulses is helpful in diagnosing common carotid and internal carotid artery occlusions and temporal arteritis. The facial pulses on the side of the occlusion are often lost with common carotid artery occlusions. In contrast, some patients with internal carotid artery occlusion will have increased facial pulses on the side of the occlusion because collateral channels develop between the external carotid artery facial branches and the carotid arteries intracranially.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac findings, especially atrial fibrillation, murmurs and cardiac enlargement, favor cardiac-origin embolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful examination of the optic fundus may reveal a cholesterol crystal, white platelet-fibrin, or red clot emboli. Subhyaloid hemorrhages in the eye suggest a suddenly developing brain or subarachnoid hemorrhage. When the carotid artery is occluded, the iris may appear speckled and the ipsilateral pupil can become dilated and poorly reactive. The retina in that circumstance may also show evidence of chronic ischemia (venous stasis retinopathy).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's account of his or her neurologic symptoms and the neurologic signs found on examination tell more about the location of the process in the brain than the particular stroke subtype. Nevertheless, the presence of some constellations of symptoms and signs occasionally suggests a specific process. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness of the face, arm, and leg on one side of the body unaccompanied by sensory, visual, or cognitive abnormalities (pure motor stroke) favors the presence of a thrombotic stroke involving penetrating arteries or a small ICH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large focal neurologic deficits that begin abruptly or progress quickly are characteristic of embolism or ICH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities of language suggest anterior circulation disease, as does the presence of motor and sensory signs on the same side of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69630\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69630 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertigo, staggering, diplopia, deafness, crossed symptoms (one side of the face and other side of the body), bilateral motor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensory signs, and hemianopsia suggest involvement of the posterior circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sudden onset of impaired consciousness in the absence of focal neurologic signs is characteristic of SAH.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best studied biomarker for differentiating subtypes of brain ischemia is the D-dimer level. Serum D-dimer levels have been generally useful in separating stroke subtypes. Among patients with acute stroke, D-dimer levels are highest in those with cardioembolic strokes and cerebral venous thrombosis and are lowest in those with brain ischemia due to penetrating artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. In patients with large artery thromboembolism, D-dimer levels are lower than in patients with cardiogenic embolism but higher than in those with penetrating artery disease. However D-dimer levels vary with time since stroke onset and these levels are not specific for differentiating stroke subtypes for individual patients. They must be interpreted in the context of the clinical and other laboratory findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1436641047\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
