It is estimated that 10,000 women and 200,000 infants die as a result of malaria infection during pregnancy; severe maternal anemia, prematurity, and low birth weight contribute to more than half of these deaths.</p><p>Human malaria is caused by five species of Plasmodia: <em>P. falciparum</em>, <em>P. vivax</em>, <em>P. ovale</em>, <em>P. malariae</em> and <em>P. knowlesi</em>.

Holo-endemic malaria refers to areas where there are very high rates of infection in the community (&gt;60 percent of children less than 5 years of age are infected) and the exposure to the parasite is stable. Therefore, women have more frequent lifetime malaria episodes, thus greater immunity, so tend to have milder complications.</p><p>In contrast, mesoendemic malaria refers to areas where transmission is lower (&lt;20 percent of children less than 5 years of age are infected) and the exposure to the parasite is more unstable. With less exposure to the parasite, the development of natural immunity may be slower. Therefore pregnant women are more likely to develop severe complications such as pulmonary edema and hypoglycemia.</p><p>Malaria in pregnancy has generally been studied in holo-endemic areas, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. In these areas, the median prevalence of maternal malaria (defined as peripheral or placental infection identified by microscopy) is 28 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In mesoendemic areas, such as malaria endemic countries within the Americas, the prevalence of malaria is lower in both pregnant and nonpregnant women, although the rate appears to be rising. The median prevalence of malaria in pregnant women in low-transmission areas outside of Africa ranges from 1.8 to 17.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>In 2014, 32 cases of malaria in pregnant women were reported to the CDC; eight cases were severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18921208\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnant versus nonpregnant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of peripheral parasitemia is higher in pregnant than in age-matched nonpregnant women living in the same geographic area both in holo-endemic and mesoendemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. As an example, malaria surveillance in 430 pregnant and 250 nonpregnant women in Kinshasa found the prevalence of active malaria was 22 and 6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similarly, in Gambia, the prevalence of parasitemia was 32 percent in pregnant women, but only 26 percent in nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The increase in parasitemia in pregnant women may be driven, in part, by an increased susceptibility to mosquito bites. In a study from Gambia, twice as many Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from under the bednets of pregnant women than from under the bednets of nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Exhaled carbon dioxide and body heat are both increased during pregnancy and may attract mosquitoes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gravidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In endemic areas, the prevalence of malaria (<em>P. falciparum</em> or <em>P. vivax</em>) generally decreases with increasing gravidity, but remains higher in pregnant women of any gravidity compared to nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In Gambia, parasitemia was more common in primigravidas (64 percent) than in women having a <span class=\"nowrap\">second/third</span> pregnancy (29 percent) or who have had four or more pregnancies (21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Others have reported a two-fold increase in infection prevalence among primigravidas compared to other groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In contrast, low gravidity was not a risk factor for malarial infection in a study from Kinshasa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>One possible explanation for this discordance is that in areas of low or episodic malaria endemicity (and therefore low immunity), all pregnant women are similarly susceptible to malaria infection, whereas in areas of high endemicity (and therefore high immunity), women are most susceptible during their first pregnancy, because they have not yet acquired sufficient pregnancy-specific immunity (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Placental malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the unique features of malaria in pregnancy is the ability of <em>P. falciparum</em>-parasitized erythrocytes to sequester within the intervillous space of the placenta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51415\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51415 \">picture 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below). Notably, placental sequestration is not a feature of <em>P. vivax</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The median prevalence of placental malaria in areas of stable transmission is 26 percent, but may be even higher when more sensitive methods for diagnosis of placental infection, such as histology or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are utilized rather than microscopy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similar to peripheral parasitemia, in holo-endemic regions the prevalence of placental malaria is higher in primigravidas (16 to 63 percent) than in multigravidas (12 to 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Overall, the average prevalence of placental malaria in primigravidas is 30 to 40 percent, twice the rate found in multigravidas.</p><p>Placental infection may be detected even in the absence of peripheral parasitemia in mothers. In an area of stable malaria transmission in Tanzania, no parasites were observed in the maternal bloodstream of 46.3 percent of the women with histologic evidence of placental malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Placental infection with <em>P. falciparum</em> appears to influence neonatal immunity, which may alter susceptibility to malaria during infancy, and may impair response to pediatric vaccines and resistance to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. The influence of in utero priming on neonatal immunity requires further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune responses occur following infection with malaria. Pregnancy selects for parasite clones that have the ability to adhere to the placenta. Partial immunity to these clones develops with successive pregnancies. Individuals living in endemic areas may develop partial immunity to disease following repeated infections and have a lower prevalence of parasitemia compared with nonimmune individuals. These individuals are referred to as &quot;semi-immune&quot; or having &quot;non-sterilizing immunity.&quot; Partial immunity does <strong>not</strong> prevent infection: following a bite by an infected mosquito, these individuals will still develop parasitemia, but the severity of symptoms is typically limited. Partial protection wanes quickly after leaving an endemic area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-malaria#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of malaria&quot;, section on 'Immunity'</a>.)</p><p>Improvements in malaria control in some areas have led to declines in malaria transmission and, in turn, immunity. A reduction in immunity to malaria during pregnancy increases the risk of adverse outcomes. As an example, a study from Mozambique reported decreased malaria transmission was associated with an 80 percent decrease in placental or peripheral malaria over the past decade, with a parallel reduction in levels of antimalarial IgG antibodies against both pregnancy-specific parasite lines (placental, or chondroitin sulfate A-binding) and more general parasite lines (rosetting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Compared with women infected prior to the overall decline in malaria prevalence and reduced immunity, pregnant women infected with malaria in recent years had increased placental parasite density and a larger reduction in both maternal hemoglobin and newborn birth weights. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy-associated <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria is characterized by sequestration and multiplication of a distinct population of malarial parasites in the placenta. These parasites express a specific class of variant surface antigens (VSAs) that mediate adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) on the syncytiotrophoblast lining the intervillous space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This process appears to involve upregulated transcription of var2csa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], which is expressed on the surface of CSA-adherent infected erythrocytes. This suggests that the var2csa gene encodes a parasite adhesion molecule that initiates the pathology associated with Pregnancy Associated Malaria (PAM).</p><p>Once these parasites adhere to the surface of trophoblastic villi, they induce accumulation of inflammatory leukocytes. Histopathology of placentas with active malaria infection shows adhesion of infected erythrocytes to syncytiotrophoblast, syncytial degradation, increased syncytial knotting and, in rare cases, localized destruction of the villi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This process may be exacerbated by the development of neovasculature at an immunologically privileged site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/6,11,15,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,15,30</a>].</p><p>In holo-endemic areas, the frequency of both placental infection and poor pregnancy outcome decrease with successive pregnancies; nonimmune pregnant women, especially nulliparas, are at higher risk for adverse maternal-perinatal outcomes compared to multiparous controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/28,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31-33</a>].</p><p>The unique VSA types expressed on pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) parasites can be serologically classified as sex specific (ie, men from malaria-endemic areas do not develop VSA antibodies) and gravidity dependent (ie, women acquire anti-VSA immunoglobulin G as a function of gravidity). Thus, the observed protection afforded multigravidas may result from maternal antibodies (eg, anti-VSA) that prevent cytoadhesion of the parasite to the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. This theory is supported by the observation that primigravid women without histological evidence of PAM have uniformly low VSA-PAM-specific plasma IgG concentrations at delivery, which are not significantly different from those in unexposed pregnant women despite lifelong <em>P. falciparum</em> exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Primigravid women with acute or chronic PAM have low-to-medium VSA-PAM IgG, likely indicating slow development of a primary response to VSA-PAM, while a high proportion of multigravid women have moderate-to-high VSA-PAM IgG values, suggesting fast and &quot;boostable&quot; memory responses that protect multigravidas from PAM and its complications (low birth weight, maternal anemia).</p><p>Pregnancy-induced immune suppression may also account for the more severe disease experienced by primigravid nonimmune women. Primigravidas express higher cortisol levels compared with multiparous women, which leads to greater depression of cell-mediated immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Other indirect support for the role of depressed cell-mediated immunity comes from the observation that specific malarial antibodies are not decreased during pregnancy, but when lymphocytes from pregnant women are challenged with malarial antigens, the lymphocyte proliferative responses are depressed compared to lymphocytes from nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation varies according to the underlying endemicity of the region. In areas of stable malaria transmission (holo-endemic regions) where partial immunity is common, most malarial infections in pregnant women are asymptomatic, but the mother remains at risk for anemia and the fetus is at risk for low birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/30,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,39</a>] (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Low birth weight'</a> below). However, for women residing in mesoendemic areas, or for women returning to a holo-endemic area after a prolonged absence, malaria is more likely to result in febrile illness, severe symptomatic disease, preterm birth, and death of mother or fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In areas of low or unstable malaria transmission where pregnant women have acquired little immunity, symptomatic malarial disease is the rule and serious complications may occur.</p><p>Parasitemia peaks in the second trimester in both primigravidas and multigravidas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/6,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,14</a>], and the increased risk for pregnancy-associated malaria persists for 60 days postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. There is a semiquantitative relationship between the degree of parasitemia and severity of disease. <em>P. falciparum</em> is associated with especially high levels of parasitemia since it invades red cells of all ages; occasionally, more than 50 percent of red cells are infected.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of malaria are nonspecific and variable. Virtually all nonimmune individuals will experience fever, which may or may not be periodic. Other frequent symptoms include: chills, sweats, headache, myalgias, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, and cough. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Compared to nonpregnant women, pregnant women experience more severe disease, more hypoglycemia, and more respiratory complications (pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Hypoglycemia occurs in 58 percent of gravid women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] versus approximately 8 percent of nonpregnant adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In holo-endemic regions, splenomegaly is noted in 10 to 23 percent of pregnant women and more often in pregnant women than nonpregnant controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Anemia is a common complication of malaria in pregnancy; approximately 60 percent of pregnant women presenting with malarial infection are anemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>] and anemia may be one of the few signs of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, anemia in resource poor countries can be due to one or more other etiologies, including nutritional deficiency, intestinal parasites (especially hookworm infections), and thalassemia trait. In one review, 5 to 10 percent of pregnant African women developed severe anemia (hemoglobin less than 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and one-quarter of these cases were attributed to malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some experts believe that malaria is a sufficiently common and serious cause of anemia in pregnant women in endemic areas that it is prudent to treat for malaria unless other causes of the anemia can be ascertained and respond to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Iron deficiency appears to protect against malaria. In a systematic review, iron deficiency based on serum ferritin and C-reactive protein was associated with lower odds for malaria parasitemia by blood smear (odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% CI 0.24-0.51; five studies) and a nonstatistical reduction in placental malaria (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.11-1.10; two studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Although iron supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of malaria (relative risk<sub> </sub>0.89, 95% CI 0.66-1.20; five studies), baseline iron status was not assessed in any of the studies, so a subgroup analysis among iron-replete and iron deficient women was not possible. &#160;</p><p>Findings from randomized trials suggest that the benefits of routine iron supplementation outweigh possible risks. One trial randomly assigned 470 rural Kenyan pregnant women in a malaria endemic area with hemoglobin concentration &ge;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> to supervised daily iron supplementation (60 mg of elemental iron) or placebo from the second trimester to one month postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Sixty percent of women were iron deficient at baseline. Iron supplementation increased maternal hemoglobin concentration and neonatal birth weight and ferritin concentration, without adversely impacting the overall risk of maternal Plasmodium infection measured at the time of delivery. A second trial conducted in Tanzania enrolled 1500 iron-replete non-anemic women and randomly assigned them to either 60 mg of elemental iron or placebo before 27 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The risk of placental malaria was not increased with iron supplementation. Maternal benefits included a 40 percent reduction in anemia at delivery, a 52 percent reduction in iron deficiency, and a 66 percent reduction in iron deficiency anemia. However, in contrast to the previous trial, iron supplementation had no significant benefit on birth weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Postpartum infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increased risk for both acquiring an infection and developing more severe disease persists for at least 60 to 70 days postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/40,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,51</a>]. Puerperal infection can also be caused by a new infection, rather than by parasites trapped in the placenta and released into the maternal blood at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The reason for the high susceptibility to infection postpartum may be related to postpartum changes in the maternal immune system, maternal behavioral changes, or other undefined factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">HIV COINFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>From the standpoint of malarial disease, a seropositive HIV status increases the morbidity and mortality associated with the malaria infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/52-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-58</a>]. Mothers with HIV may be at higher risk for malaria acquisition, placental malaria, higher parasite densities, and more severe clinical disease. After delivery, women with HIV and malaria are at increased risk for anemia compared to HIV seronegative women with or without malaria. Dual infection with malaria and HIV also leads to an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. These issues and chemoprophylaxis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-and-malaria#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV and malaria&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>.) </p><p>Studies are conflicting as to whether placental malaria increases perinatal HIV transmission. Given this possibility, we emphasize that HIV-infected pregnant women should receive optimal malaria prevention measures during pregnancy (bednets, chemoprophylaxis, prompt diagnosis, and treatment of infections) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/59-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of malaria should be considered in any febrile woman who has resided in a malarious region, or traveled to a malarious region even if briefly or only in transit. Standard methods that detect peripheral parasitemia can be used in pregnant women, and include Giemsa-stained thick <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thin peripheral blood smears or rapid diagnostics. It is important to point out that women may have placental parasites that are not circulating in the peripheral blood, hence, the blood film would be negative. No reliable peripheral biomarker for placental malaria has been identified; the diagnosis is made by histological examination after delivery.

While diagnosis of submicroscopic infection may be of critical importance in eradication efforts, the clinical impact on birth outcomes appears minimal in most studies so PCR is not indicated at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>].

In areas where malaria is endemic, women have usually acquired sufficient immunity to prevent febrile illness, and they are less likely to experience preterm birth and the severe maternal complications of malaria. Nonetheless, asymptomatic mothers remain at risk for anemia, and their fetuses remain at risk for impaired growth (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Low birth weight'</a> below)</p><p>In a review of 117 studies published between 1985 and 2000 from endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa, the population attributable risks for adverse birth outcomes associated with malaria were marked: anemia (3 to 15 percent), LBW (8 to 14 percent), growth restriction (13 to 70 percent), and infant mortality (3 to 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In another review, it was estimated that in endemic areas approximately 19 percent of LBW infants result from maternal malaria infection, and 6 percent of infant deaths have been attributed to malaria-related LBW.

After adjustment for maternal age, previous miscarriages, smoking, and non-malaria febrile illness, the odds of miscarriage in women with <em>P. falciparum</em> or <em>P. vivax</em> malaria were about threefold higher than in women without malaria. The frequency of miscarriage in women without malaria, those with treated malaria, and all women with malaria (treated and untreated) was 19, 27, and 35 percent, respectively.

In particular, infected women have an increased concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the intervillous circulation, and the concentration of TNF-alpha correlates with the density of <em>P. falciparum</em>-infected erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/87,88,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88,91</a>]. Production of TNF-alpha plays a role in the pathogenesis of preterm birth and LBW.

Distinguishing between the two is challenging in resource-poor settings where ultrasound dating of pregnancy is usually not available and maternal recall of the last menstrual period is poor. In some settings, malaria has been estimated to be responsible for up to 70 percent of fetal growth restriction and up to 25 percent of LBW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

A significant decrease (150 g) in the average birth weight of infants of primigravidas with placental malaria has been reported, but this decrease was not significant (52 g) in offspring of multigravidas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is related to the observation that primigravidas are more likely to have placental malaria and heavier parasite loads and are less likely to have partial immunity. Support for this theory was illustrated in a study that showed affected multigravidas had higher plasma levels of anti-VAR2CSA IgG, gave birth to markedly heavier babies, and had a significantly lower risk of delivering LBW children than affected primigravid women in whom anti-VAR2CSA IgG levels were low and placental sequestration was increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The level of adhesion of placental parasites to chondroitin sulfate receptors also appears to be an important risk factor for LBW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p>The assumption of causality is confounded by the frequent concomitant presence of anemia in primigravidas with placental malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/6,11,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,39</a>], which is independently associated with LBW. Indeed, when controlling for this confounding variable, the relationship between malaria and LBW becomes insignificant. However, since malaria is often the cause of the anemia, an association remains clinically compelling. A cohort study from Malawi including 2462 pregnant women found that an increasing number of <em>P. falciparum</em> infections during pregnancy increased the risks of both LBW and maternal anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

One of the unique features of malaria in pregnancy is the ability of <em>P. falciparum</em>- parasitized erythrocytes to sequester within the intervillous space of the placenta. Placental infection and poor pregnancy outcome decrease in frequency with successive pregnancies for women who reside in endemic areas: nonimmune pregnant women, especially nulliparas, are at higher risk of adverse maternal-perinatal outcome than multiparous women. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence, microbiology, and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy-associated malaria is characterized by sequestration and multiplication of a distinct population of malarial parasites in the placenta. These parasites express a specific class of variant surface antigens (VSAs) that mediate adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) on the syncytiotrophoblast lining the intervillous space. Once these parasites adhere to the surface of trophoblastic villi, they induce accumulation of inflammatory leukocytes. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation varies according to the underlying endemicity of the region. Parasitemia peaks in the second trimester in both primigravidas and multigravidas, and the increased risk for pregnancy-associated malaria persists for 60 days postpartum. Anemia and hypoglycemia are common maternal clinical manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of malaria should be considered in any febrile pregnant woman who has traveled to or resided in a malarious region, even if briefly or only in transit.
