Some have symptoms or signs that are directly referable to the kidney (such as hematuria) or to associated extrarenal manifestations (edema, hypertension, signs of uremia).

Making this determination accurately requires the availability of older data for comparison. Knowing the disease duration helps to narrow the differential diagnosis of cause and to provide prognostic information to guide management.</p><p>The distinction between acute kidney injury (AKI), subacute kidney injury, and CKD is arbitrary, but the following definitions have been established by consensus panels:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute</strong> &ndash; AKI is defined by a rise in the serum creatinine concentration or an abnormal urine output that has developed within hours to days. The criteria for AKI include an increase in serum creatinine by &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (27 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> relative to a known baseline value within 48 hours, or an increase to &ge;1.5 times the baseline value within seven days, or a decrease in urine volume to &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over six hours (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO]-AKI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83168 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">AKI is most commonly diagnosed in hospitalized patients.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H27258481\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Definition of CKD'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subacute </strong>&ndash; KDIGO guidelines proposed the term, acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), to encompasses any decrement in renal function occurring in less than three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-newly-identified-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Disorders that evolve over more than 48 hours but generally in under three months are informally referred to as subacute kidney injury. There is considerable overlap in acute and subacute presentations.</p><p/><p>We emphasize that terminology is less important than a clear understanding of the natural history of such diseases. The distinctions between subacute kidney injury and CKD and between subacute kidney injury and AKI can be arbitrary. As an example, a patient who presents with an elevated creatinine over 6 to 12 months or who has an acute deterioration of previously stable CKD is better evaluated as subacute kidney injury rather than CKD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The assessment of disease duration is best performed by comparing the current serum creatinine concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinalysis with previous results. As an example, a patient with a current serum creatinine concentration of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (354 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and a value of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (53 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> one month previously has acute or rapidly progressive disease. In contrast, the same patient with a prior serum creatinine concentration of 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (309 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> two years ago almost certainly has slowly progressive CKD.</p><p>When a previous urinalysis, serum creatinine concentration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic study are unavailable, certain findings from the history and physical examination may suggest the duration of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-newly-identified-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recent onset of symptoms or signs, such as sudden onset of anasarca and discolored urine, suggests an acute process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked oliguria (urine output &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> or anuria in a patient not on maintenance dialysis indicates an acute process since prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">oliguria/anuria</span> does not occur in slowly progressive CKD (even if advanced).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A progressive increase in the serum creatinine concentration on a daily basis after the initial evaluation indicates an acute process while a stable value suggests CKD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging showing small kidneys provides definitive evidence of chronicity. However, the presence of normal-sized kidneys does <strong>not</strong> exclude chronicity, since some causes of CKD such as diabetic nephropathy are associated with preserved kidney size. Renal parenchyma echogenicity (normally less echogenicity than of healthy liver parenchyma), if markedly increased, suggests nonspecific diffuse renal disease. Increased echogenicity combined with relatively small kidneys further supports diagnosis of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-newly-identified-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

As an example, anemia due to erythropoietin deficiency is a common (though not absolute) finding in CKD, but many acute diseases cause both hemolysis or bleeding and AKI or subacute injury. Although hyperphosphatemia commonly affects CKD patients, it may also be seen in AKI or subacute kidney injury, so it does not distinguish acute from chronic disease. The lack of presence of anemia or hyperphosphatemia does not exclude the presence of CKD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19999942\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR CAUSES AND CLASSIFICATION OF KIDNEY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional approach to kidney disease has been to categorize the clinical etiology as prerenal (decreased renal perfusion pressure), intrinsic renal (pathology of the vessels, glomeruli, or tubules-interstitium), or postrenal (obstructive). CKD may result from disease processes in any of these categories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20000064\"><span class=\"h2\">Prerenal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic prerenal disease occurs in patients with ongoing heart failure or cirrhosis with persistently decreased renal perfusion, which increases the propensity for intrinsic kidney injury, such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

However, anuria may be present among patients with acute superimposed on chronic kidney disease, such as is observed in a patient with chronic obstruction who develops acute urinary retention. Anuria occurs as a result of <span class=\"nowrap\">severe/prolonged</span> shock, bilateral urinary tract obstruction, pregnancy-related cortical necrosis, or bilateral renal arterial obstruction (eg, dissecting aortic aneurysm).

Patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that does not change over sequential measurements, minimal or no proteinuria, and no cellular elements on urine microscopy undergo a limited evaluation, and a renal biopsy is rarely performed. In such patients, the cause of CKD is usually not identified with certainty. By contrast, patients with significant proteinuria and glomerular hematuria or sterile pyuria often undergo renal biopsy to determine cause, even if the estimated GFR (eGFR) remains unchanged. Abnormalities in renal imaging may warrant urologic evaluation and urodynamic studies.

In one retrospective study, testing had a higher yield for paraprotein-related kidney disease when CKD was more advanced on presentation (ie, eGFR &lt;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or when hypercalcemia (calcium &gt;10.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> was present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-newly-identified-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Among patients with small, echogenic kidneys, the biopsy is most likely to demonstrate chronic changes and very unlikely to yield information that could be used to inform therapy.
