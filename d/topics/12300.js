Almost 3 percent of women born in the United States (US) will be diagnosed with uterine cancer during their lifetime, based on 2012 to 2014 data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This represents an increase in the incidence of uterine cancer in the US over the years 2006 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], which is likely due to women living longer and the increasing rates of obesity in the US. </p><p>Fortunately, most women with endometrial cancer will survive their initial diagnosis, making this the largest group of survivors who had a gynecologic malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For example, in the US there were an estimated 710,228 survivors with a history of uterine cancer in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], which is estimated to climb to over 750,000 survivors by 2024 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Unfortunately, there is a lack of clear evidence for what constitutes best practices in caring for patients with a history of endometrial cancer. Recommendations for posttreatment surveillance after primary therapy of endometrial cancer will be reviewed here. </p><p>For purposes of this discussion, we will address survivorship as it pertains to patients who have completed initial treatment for endometrial cancer and who are without evidence of disease.</p><p>The treatment of patients with endometrial cancer is discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endometrial carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to adjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202081407\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary treatment for endometrial cancer is surgical.

However, some patients may have received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (with or without paclitaxel). Depending on the institution and provider preferences, some patients may have also received RT for high-risk disease, although there is no consensus on the use of RT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-treatment-of-high-risk-endometrial-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant treatment of high-risk endometrial cancers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202081543\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP POST-TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posttreatment surveillance is aimed at the early detection of recurrent disease. For women with endometrial carcinoma, surveillance consists mainly of monitoring for symptoms and physical examinations. Routine use of serum CA 125 and imaging varies across institutions; however, the benefit of surveillance to detect asymptomatic disease is controversial. In our practice we do not use serum CA 125 or imaging studies unless clinically indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>There is no high-quality evidence that any specific posttreatment surveillance strategy is associated with improved outcomes. In the absence of data, we agree with the consensus-based guidelines from the United States National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the Society for Gynecologic Oncologists (SGO), which include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of symptoms and physical examination including speculum and bimanual pelvic exam every three to six months for two years, then every six months or annually. The frequency of examinations depends upon the risk of persistent or recurrent disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic counseling for patients with a family history suggestive of Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H72545955\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p>We do not perform vaginal cytology in endometrial cancer survivors. Data suggest vaginal smears are ineffective in the detection of recurrences compared with physical examination alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. For example, in a retrospective study of women with endometrial carcinoma (n = 433), all of whom had undergone hysterectomy, 13 percent (n = 55) had at least one abnormal result, representing three percent of all pap tests performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Abnormal vaginal cytology had a sensitivity of 40 percent and a specificity of 88 percent for detecting a vaginal recurrence. </p><p>When planning the posttreatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of CT scans, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies. Routine use of chest radiography in an asymptomatic survivor is also not supported by evidence. However, imaging studies such as chest radiography, CT, magnetic resonance imaging should be performed for patients who are symptomatic or have abnormal findings on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A 2013 meta-analysis of 11 studies (10 of which were retrospective) supports the use of positron emission tomography (PET) as another modality for the evaluation of a suspected recurrence, particularly when performed with a CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this analysis, PET had a sensitivity and specificity of 95 and 93 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202082248\"><span class=\"h1\">PATTERN OF RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of endometrial carcinoma recurrences occur within three years after treatment (68 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Sites of recurrence are fairly evenly distributed between <span class=\"nowrap\">vaginal/pelvic</span> and distant (abdominal or lung) metastases. The risk of local, but not distant, recurrence is lower in patients who have received radiation therapy. The most common sites of recurrent disease are the vaginal vault, pelvis, abdomen, and lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Approximately 70 percent of endometrial carcinoma recurrences are associated with symptoms, based upon a systematic review of 16 observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is important to note that no survival difference was found between women with asymptomatic versus symptomatic recurrences. Signs or symptoms suggestive of recurrence include: vaginal bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain, persistent cough, or unexplained weight loss. </p><p>Asymptomatic recurrences were detected by the following modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination (5 to 33 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal ultrasound (4 to 13 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Abdominal/pelvic</span> computed tomography (CT) (5 to 21 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiography (0 to 14 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CA 125 in selected patients (15 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal vault cytology (0 to 4 percent)</p><p/><p>Any visible lesion identified on pelvic exam should be biopsied because isolated vaginal recurrences are most often curable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This was illustrated in the Post-Operative Radiation Therapy for Endometrial Cancer (PORTEC) trial in which 39 of 174 patients experienced an isolated vaginal relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Despite these barriers, the majority of women would prefer to discuss issues of sexual dysfunction but may be unwilling to initiate the discussion. Although the best time to discuss sexual health is likely prior to treatment, the time of diagnosis and discussion of cancer treatment can be stressful and introducing a discussion about treatment related sexual issues is difficult. Nevertheless, incorporating a sexual history into the routine review of systems may help to normalize sexual health as an appropriate area to discuss between patients and their clinicians. After treatment, questions about sexual health should be a routine part of surveillance. If a problem is identified, open-ended questions should be asked in order to avoid any misconceptions about the patient&rsquo;s sexual preferences. Resources should be made available for those patients who wish to pursue treatment for sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>Non-endocrine and endocrine therapies are available to address sexual health concerns. These include polycarbophilic moisturizers (eg, Replens), vaginal pH-balanced gels (eg, RepHresh), and local estrogen therapies, which can be administered as gels or as a vaginal tablet. Beyond these remedies, referral to a local resource in sexual function after cancer, or an oncology sexual health clinic, if available, may be helpful. A more comprehensive discussion on the treatment of sexual dysfunction is beyond the scope of this topic, but several comprehensive reviews are available.

For example, in Gynecologic Oncology Group trial 137, over 1200 endometrial cancer survivors (95 percent with stage I disease and 90 percent with endometrioid type adenocarcinomas) were randomly assigned to treatment with oral estrogen or a placebo preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

However, the data are limited due to multiple factors including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The small number of absolute events in both the ERT and control groups (14 versus 12 recurrences, respectively; 5 versus 4 deaths due to endometrial cancer) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poor compliance in the group assigned to ERT (41 percent stayed on treatment throughout the course of the study) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poor accrual, which resulted in early study termination </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the wide confidence interval and the small absolute increase in risk associated with ERT (0.4 percent), we consider ERT a reasonable approach to the treatment of menopausal symptoms in this population. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with <strong>intermediate-risk or high-risk disease</strong>, we prefer non-hormonal interventions for menopausal symptoms.

Lymphedema most often manifests as lower extremity edema, but might also present as lower extremity heaviness, discomfort, or pain. While lymphedema is exacerbated by the addition of radiation, there is a significant rate of lymphedema present after surgery alone. Unfortunately, the incidence of lymphedema may be under-reported. </p><p>Most of the data about risk factors for and prevention of lymphedema are found in women treated for breast cancer.

Studies specifically performed in women with a gynecologic cancer are largely retrospective, and are limited by lack of uniformity in how lymphedema was diagnosed. Findings from the limited data include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of symptomatic lymphedema is reportedly between 5 and 10 percent of all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of lymphedema appears to be higher in those patients in whom a complete pelvic and or paraaortic lymphadenectomy was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>]. This is supported by a 2010 meta-analysis that reported that lymphadenectomy significantly increased the risk of lymphedema compared with no lymphadenectomy (relative risk 8.39, 95% CI, 4.06-17.33) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Improvement in QOL following treatment to decrease limb volume was found, as was increased confidence and activities.

Radiation effects can be classified as acute, occurring during or shortly after completion of treatment, or chronic, usually defined as beginning 3 to 12 months following completion of treatment and lasting a lifetime. Severe problems are fortunately rare, occurring in 4 to 10 percent of patients over a 5 to 10 year period following treatment completion, and include transfusion dependent rectal bleeding, fistula formation, bowel obstruction, and secondary malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Chronic GI symptoms are far more common, and include diarrhea, abdominal and rectal pain, bloating, flatulence, and fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p>There are limited data specific to the effect of pelvic radiation on overall quality of life for endometrial cancer patients. Many studies combine patients with cervical and endometrial cancer, a combination that may not be logical given the very different patient populations and radiation techniques utilized. One study from Britain confirmed a rate of 47 percent of women with cervical and endometrial cancer with symptoms of chronic radiation enteritis. Despite their symptoms, however, many women stated that their overall QOL was good, even though 42 percent had to rush to the toilet and 32 percent suffered fecal incontinence, suggesting a tendency to understate these symptoms. Most women had to carefully watch their diet, wear pads to keep clean, and frequently had to change their underclothes. About a third of women felt depressed, anxious, or experienced fatigue due to bowel problems. Limited data on effects on QOL suggest that women treated with RT have a lower QOL compared with matched healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>]. It has also been demonstrated that oncologists frequently underestimate the radiation-related long-term morbidities in cancer survivors compared with the patients&rsquo; actual experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. This may be secondary to patient factors, as the patient may not report symptoms for a variety of reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p>External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) results in increases in diarrhea scores and bowel symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/40,81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,81,82</a>]. The PORTEC study, which randomized women with endometrial cancer to receive either whole pelvic external beam radiotherapy or vaginal brachytherapy, considered quality of life with respect to gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients treated with EBRT reported a 21 percent increase in mean diarrhea scores. After EBRT, 15.4 percent and 7.3 percent of patients reported quite a bit or very much diarrhea. While these scores decreased over time, they still remained at significantly higher levels than patients who received vaginal brachytherapy with additional follow-up. In addition, patients treated with EBRT reported an 8 percent increase in fecal leakage 6 months after radiation therapy. Patients treated with EBRT reported a significantly higher need to remain close to a toilet, which resulted in a higher level of limitation of daily activities because of a bowel problem. As a result, social functioning after EBRT was significantly lower than after VBT.</p><p>While patients may have significant acute gastrointestinal problems during and immediately after radiation treatment, these issues do not seem to impact overall QOL and also seem to improve over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, compared with patients treated with surgery alone, those treated with adjuvant RT report continued chronic persistent bowel problems months to years after completing RT that do not improve with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/78,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,83</a>]. Interestingly, even though patients believed they were significantly impacted by the RT, they felt overall better having successfully completed the treatment protocol, perhaps due to the perceived benefit of reducing recurrence risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Patients having external beam radiation therapy report higher gastrointestinal symptom burden than women who receive only brachytherapy. In one study 16 percent of women who received EBRT had quite a bit or very much diarrhea compared with 5 percent of women who received brachytherapy only. GI and diarrhea symptoms were highest among women who received EBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>The best solution to the problem of GI toxicity following radiation may be avoiding radiation treatment, especially in light of randomized studies that show the lack of a survival benefit for many patients who have traditionally received whole pelvic RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

When RT is required, new radiation planning techniques can be utilized to minimize bowel toxicity. These include the use of intensity modulated RT, which spares the GI tract and results in decrease in GI toxicity with equivalent treatment effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>].

Most women will not admit to fecal leakage or chronic diarrhea due to embarrassment as well as fear of judgment from their physician. There is a need for clinicians who are adequately trained to help women manage chronic GI problems, which ideally consists of a multidisciplinary model, including nutritionists and gastroenterologists. Techniques to prevent excessive bowel toxicity during treatment, such as new radiation techniques or bowel protection modalities as well as early intervention to prevent late radiation toxicities can be helpful prior to the development of symptoms. </p><p>For patients who present with gastrointestinal toxicities related to prior treatment, the management is similar to other patients and is discussed separately.

In our practice, an oncologist follows patients for three to five years, after which they may transition back to a general gynecologist or primary care physician.

The most common sites of recurrent disease are the vaginal vault, pelvis, abdomen, and lungs. (See <a href=\"#H202082248\" class=\"local\">'Pattern of recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chemotherapy agents used to treat endometrial cancer include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>. Although most women do well with treatment, all three of these agents are associated with lingering toxicities that may persist after treatment has ended. These include neuropathy, risk of cardiotoxicity, fatigue, and postchemotherapy cognitive impairment. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pembrolizumab</a> is also approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for microsatellite-instable solid tumors and is associated with certain immune-related toxicities. (See <a href=\"#H540580814\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy-related toxicities'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity is perhaps the most important risk factor for the development of endometrial cancer. In addition, obesity may be associated with poorer outcomes after treatment. Therefore, we encourage endometrial cancer survivors to adopt lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity, regular exercise routines, and overall be less sedentary. (See <a href=\"#H7205992\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual dysfunction in endometrial cancer survivors is complex and multifactorial. Sexual dysfunction may be related to the surgical procedure itself or may be related to adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Sexual symptoms are important to address in these patients because treatments are available if symptoms are present. (See <a href=\"#H7205998\" class=\"local\">'Sexual dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to women with endometrial cancer who have menopausal symptoms takes into account the risk-status of their disease (see <a href=\"#H202082795\" class=\"local\">'Menopausal symptoms'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with <strong>low-risk disease, </strong>we suggest estrogen-replacement therapy rather than a non-hormonal treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with <strong>intermediate-risk or high-risk disease</strong>, we suggest a non-estrogenic treatment rather than estrogen replacement therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, estrogen may be indicated if symptoms are not controlled. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphedema is a significant and under-reported problem for patients with endometrial cancer, particularly those who have undergone retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy as part of the staging procedure for their disease. While lymphedema is exacerbated by the addition of radiation, there is a significant rate of lymphedema present after surgery alone. Sentinel node assessment may decrease the rate of postoperative lymphedema. (See <a href=\"#H7206004\" class=\"local\">'Lymphedema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health providers need to be more proactive in identifying and treating women with chronic bowel symptoms related to radiation therapy, as they are often reluctant to mention symptoms due to embarrassment or reluctance to complain. Most women will not admit to fecal leakage or chronic diarrhea due to embarrassment as well as fear of judgment from their physician. (See <a href=\"#H7206010\" class=\"local\">'Radiation-related gastrointestinal toxicity'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.
