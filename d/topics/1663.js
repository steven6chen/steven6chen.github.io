The name &quot;prolymphocyte&quot; is actually a misnomer, as the tumor cells in this disease are mature activated B cells. By definition, these prolymphocytes comprise greater than 55 percent of the cells in the blood and bone marrow.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of B-PLL are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>B-PLL is an extremely rare disease, comprising far less than 1 percent of B cell leukemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since the diagnosis was changed to exclude cases of mantle cell lymphoma, atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/PLL</span> (defined as between 15 and 55 percent prolymphocytes), B-PLL has become increasingly rare.</p><p>B-PLL mainly affects the elderly with a mean age at presentation of between 65 and 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Men and women appear to be equally affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The vast majority of patients are Caucasian.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients typically present with a rapidly rising white blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span> and massive splenomegaly; anemia and thrombocytopenia are present in approximately 65 and 35 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Systemic B symptoms (ie, fevers, night sweats, weight loss) are common. If present, peripheral lymphadenopathy is not prominent.

Peripheral blood prolymphocytes are medium-sized cells (approximately twice the size of a small lymphocyte), with moderately condensed chromatin and a single, prominent vesicular nucleolus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85966\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85966 \">picture 1</a>).

This is in contrast to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) which generally has dim expression of surface Ig and CD20. ZAP-70 and CD38 are expressed in about 50 percent of cases, while CD5 and CD23 are expressed in about one-third of cases.</p><p>CD38 and ZAP-70 do not have prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Helping to distinguish B-PLL from other lymphoproliferative disorders is the absence of expression of CD11c, CD103, CD10, CD25, and cyclin D1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic lesions underlying B-PLL are largely unknown. Abnormalities of MYC (rearrangements and increased copy number) are seen in approximately 50 percent of cases but are not necessarily associated with a more aggressive clinical behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Deletions of 17p (the chromosomal arm that carries the <em>TP53</em> gene) and <em>TP53</em> mutations are found in more than half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Deletions of 13q14, the site of the retinoblastoma gene, occur in about 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Prior to the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, translocations involving 14q32 were reported in two-thirds of patients with B-PLL, the most common being the t(11;14)(q13;q32) involving the cyclin D1 gene. However, patients with this translocation are now considered to have a leukemic variant of mantle cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As such, it is important to exclude this translocation, either by cytogenetic testing or by immunohistochemical staining for cyclin D1, in cases of suspected B-PLL.

Although not used in routine practice, the gene expression profile of B-PLL is different from that of CLL and displays over-expression of c-MYC and AKT, and downregulation of <em>TP53</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of B-PLL is usually made based on the results of immunophenotypic and genetic analysis of the peripheral blood. Results of bone marrow biopsy and aspirate can confirm these findings, but are often available after the peripheral blood analysis. When the white blood cell count is elevated and an evaluation of the peripheral blood and bone marrow is consistent with B-PLL, lymph node biopsy rarely adds additional information and is not necessary. Splenectomy can be diagnostic in patients with an unclear presentation and a massively enlarged spleen.</p><p>By definition, prolymphocytes must exceed 55 percent of lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood. These cells can be confirmed by flow cytometry demonstrating a characteristic immunophenotype with light chain restriction, bright surface immunoglobulin, and the expression of B cell antigens (eg, CD20, CD22, FMC7, CD79a). CD5 and CD23 expression is usually weak or absent. CD11c, CD103, CD10, and CD25 are not expressed. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Immunophenotype'</a> above.)</p><p>Tumors demonstrating t(11;14)(q13;q32) must be excluded by either conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or by immunohistochemical stains for cyclin D1.

Unlike B-PLL, T-PLL expresses one or more T cell antigens (CD2, CD3, CD7, CD53). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic lymphocytic leukemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both B-PLL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can present with lymphocytosis, splenomegaly, and circulating prolymphocytes in the blood, but in CLL prolymphocytes comprise less than 55 percent of the cells, whereas in most cases of B-PLL greater than 90 percent of the cells are pro-lymphocytes. Compared with typical CLL cells, prolymphocytes are larger cells with somewhat immature-appearing nuclear chromatin, a prominent nucleolus, and a moderate amount of cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85966\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85966 \">picture 1</a>). While prolymphocytes are seen in variable numbers in CLL, they typically comprise over 90 percent of the neoplastic cells in B-PLL and usually comprise fewer than 10 percent of the circulating cells in CLL. In addition, in two-thirds of cases of B-PLL the prolymphocytes are CD5 negative, whereas as a rule the prolymphocytes of CLL are CD5 positive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with peripheral blood prolymphocyte counts between 10 and 55 percent have been designated as having chronic lymphocytic <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/prolymphocytic</span> leukemia in the past, but this entity has been eliminated in the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>]. Rarely, cases of CLL can undergo prolymphocytoid transformation. In such cases, the peripheral blood will contain a mixture of small mature CLL cells and prolymphocytes. The prolymphocytes in such cases usually have an immunophenotype similar to that seen with typical CLL, although sometimes with higher levels of surface Ig. In contrast, circulating cells in de novo B-PLL are monomorphic prolymphocytes with an immunophenotype characteristic of B-PLL as described above. In addition, histologic findings on bone marrow biopsy in cases of CLL with prolymphocytoid transformation are consistent with those found in CLL (eg, proliferation centers).

As in a subset of B-PLLs, MCL cells co-express CD5 and CD20. However, the neoplastic cells of MCL express cyclin D1, which is dysregulated by a (11;14) translocation involving the cyclin D1 gene. SOX11 expression is usually present in the rare cases of MCL that do not express cyclin D1. In contrast, the malignant cells in PLL are negative for cyclin D1 and do not demonstrate t(11;14).

However, the circulating malignant cells of LPL often have a plasmacytoid appearance and are usually few in number, whereas B-PLL is usually associated with WBCs of over 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. Moreover, B-PLL is never associated with a significant level of paraproteinemia, whereas this is typical of patients with LPL.

Such cases may also have extreme leukocytosis and expression of the interleukin-2 receptor beta chain, but not the alpha chain (CD25). Unlike B-PLL, most cases of HCL-variant express some combination of CD11c, CD103, CD123, cyclin D1, and annexin A1, none of which are typically expressed on B-PLL cells.

When compared with splenic MZL, B-PLL is more likely to present with clinically aggressive disease, B symptoms, and extreme leukocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;100,000/microL)</span>. While the circulating lymphocytes in B-PLL usually have a regular, smooth cytoplasmic outline, splenic MZL cells usually have short polar villi, although this may be masked by poor slide preparation. Both B-PLL and splenic MZL express CD20 and bright surface Ig. Neither typically expresses CD5. Expression of CD22 is usually strong in B-PLL and variable in MZL. Both MZL and B-PLL involve both the splenic white pulp and red pulp, but in MZL marginal zones are usually prominent due to expansion by cells with abundant pale cytoplasm, and plasmacytic differentiation may also be observed, features that are absent in B-PLL. Bone marrow morphology in MZL may take the form of reactive-appearing follicles surrounded by marginal zone B cells, features that are not seen in B-PLL. In difficult cases, pathologic evaluation of the bone marrow, spleen, and hilar lymph nodes may be used in concert to determine the most likely diagnosis.

Most patients, however, do require treatment, and the most appropriate choice is unclear due to lack of clinical data.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients typically present with a rapidly rising white blood count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span> and massive splenomegaly with or without B symptoms (ie, fevers, night sweats, weight loss). If present, peripheral lymphadenopathy is not prominent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is usually made by bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with flow cytometry and genetic studies. By definition, prolymphocytes must exceed 55 percent of lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood. These cells express pan-B cell markers and high levels of surface immunoglobulin, and are CD5 negative in two-thirds of cases and almost always negative for CD10. Cases of mantle cell lymphoma masquerading as B-PLL must be excluded, particularly in suspected B-PLL cases that express CD5. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of B-PLL includes other chronic lymphoid neoplasms with a leukemic presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54944 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B-PLL is commonly treated with combination regimens used for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Individual chemotherapy regimens have not been directly compared, and a choice among regimens is made largely based upon the side effect profile and the clinician's experience with the regimen. (See <a href=\"#H6225733\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival is usually three to five years despite therapy. Prognostic markers have been difficult to determine, but anemia, thrombocytopenia, advanced age, and the presence of <em>TP53</em> mutations appear to predict a poor outcome. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Yamamoto JF, Goodman MT.
