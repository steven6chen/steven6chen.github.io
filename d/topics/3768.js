A multicenter randomized controlled trial evaluated the use of serial PCT testing to guide antibiotic therapy in 1710 term and late preterm neonates with suspected early-onset sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-sepsis-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Infants were assigned to one of two treatment protocols in which duration of antibiotic therapy was guided by risk classification based on clinical examination findings, blood culture results, WBC, and CRP, with or without serial PCT measurements. Duration of antibiotic therapy was reduced in the PCT group compared with the control group (55.1 versus 65.0 hours, respectively).The rate of reinfection was low in both groups (0.7 percent for the PCT group and 0.6 percent for the control group) and there was only one death (in the control group). However, the study protocol's suggested duration of antibiotic therapy for infants with negative cultures was fairly liberal (eg, up to 72 hours for infants categorized as &quot;low risk&quot;; five to seven days for those in the &quot;medium risk&quot; category); these are longer than what some experts would advocate. In addition, the suggested duration of antibiotic therapy was overruled by the treating clinician in 45 percent of infants in the PCT group and 41 percent of those in the control group. The findings reinforce the concept that when serial PCT levels are obtained, they should be used in conjunction with other clinical indicators of sepsis and should not be the sole basis of decision-making. Additional studies are required to more confidently establish the role of PCT as an adjunctive measure for decisions regarding length of antibiotic treatment in neonatal sepsis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytokines, chemokines, and other biomarkers</strong> &ndash; Both proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) are increased in infected infants compared with those without infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-sepsis-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>].
