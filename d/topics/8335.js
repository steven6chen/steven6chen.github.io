There are 2 main types of dry powder inhalers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single-dose inhalers &ndash; These come with capsules of medicine. You need to put a capsule into the inhaler each time you use it. Examples of single-dose inhalers include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indacaterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">indacaterol</a> (brand name: Arcapta Neohaler), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tiotropium</a> (brand name: Spiriva Handihaler), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">glycopyrrolate</a> (brand name: Seebri Neohaler).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple-dose inhalers &ndash; These come with all of the doses already in the inhaler. Examples of multiple-dose inhalers include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">mometasone</a> (brand name: Asmanex Twisthaler), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-and-formoterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">budesonide-formoterol</a> (brand name: Symbicort), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-and-vilanterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fluticasone-vilanterol</a> (brand name: Breo Ellipta).</p><p/><p>The directions for the 2 types of dry powder inhalers are slightly different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16518142\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I use my dry powder inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each dry powder inhaler comes with its own directions. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use your inhaler.</p><p>In general, these are the steps for using a dry powder inhaler:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open the inhaler or take off the cover</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Load a dose of medicine:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For single-dose inhalers, you load a dose by taking a pill out of its packaging and putting the pill into the inhaler. Then you need to push 1 or more buttons on the inhaler to poke holes in the pill.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For multiple-dose inhalers, you load a dose by sliding a lever or twisting the bottom (or another part) of the inhaler.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold your inhaler in the correct position &ndash; Some inhalers need to be held upright, but others need to be horizontal. Multiple-dose inhalers usually need to be horizontal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe out normally &ndash; but <strong>not</strong> into the inhaler</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put your mouth on the mouthpiece</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe in quickly and steadily, and as deeply as possible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove your mouth from the mouthpiece and hold your breath for 5 to 10 seconds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let your breath out&mdash;but <strong>not</strong> into the inhaler</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are supposed to take 2 puffs of your inhaler, load another dose and breathe it in</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close your inhaler or replace the cover or cap</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rinse your mouth out with water, gargle, and spit out the water</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For single-dose inhalers, open the inhaler, take out the used pill, and throw it away. You can do this right away, or the next time you take a dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Store your inhaler in a cool, dry place</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16518149\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to clean my inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Do <strong>not</strong> wash a dry powder inhaler with water or put it under water. If the mouthpiece gets dirty, you can wipe it with a dry cloth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16518156\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know when my inhaler is empty?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many dry powder inhalers come with a built-in dose counter. A counter keeps track of how many doses are left in your inhaler.</p><p>When the counter reads 0 (zero), it's time to throw out the inhaler because it has no more medicine in it. Make sure to have another inhaler on hand before the counter reads 0.</p><p>If your inhaler doesn't have a built-in counter, you need to keep track of the number of doses left in your inhaler. Based on how often you use your inhaler, you can figure out when you will need a refill and write this date down.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16518163\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-soft-mist-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your soft mist inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-corticosteroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Inhaled corticosteroid medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
