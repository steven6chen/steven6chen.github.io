However, not all patients with metastatic RCC behave similarly; some data suggest that there may be a subgroup whose tumors will display an indolent growth pattern that may warrant careful surveillance rather than active surgical or medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, the basis for cytoreductive nephrectomy comes from two randomized controlled trials conducted in the era of immunotherapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) randomly assigned 246 patients presenting with RCC to treatment with nephrectomy followed by interferon alfa (IFNa; 5 million <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> three times weekly) versus immediate treatment with IFNa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Compared with IFNa alone, nephrectomy before treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (median 11 versus 8 months, respectively).

In multivariable analysis, cytoreductive nephrectomy was associated with improved overall survival (median 19.8 versus 9.4 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.68).

However, there are only limited data to inform the role of nephrectomy in these patients, and in the absence of the results of prospective clinical trials, initial cytoreductive nephrectomy is reasonable in appropriately selected patients with metastatic RCC (eg, projected survival &gt;12 months, fewer than four poor prognostic factors). </p><p>Retrospective data lend support for the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy in carefully selected patients with metastatic RCC. For example, one study included almost 1700 patients from the IMDC, all of whom were treated with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR, formerly known as a mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Compared with patients who did not undergo a cytoreductive nephrectomy (n = 676), those who underwent this surgery (n = 982) had significantly longer overall survival (median 20.6 versus 9.6 months, respectively). While there was evidence of patient selection bias for those undergoing surgery (eg, they were significantly less likely to have a non-clear-cell pathology, bone metastases, and liver metastases), after adjustment for poor prognostic risk factors, surgery was still associated with a significant benefit in overall survival (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.52-0.69) as well as progression-free survival (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.85). Further analyses suggested that patients likely to <strong>not</strong> benefit from surgery included patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With more than four risk factors present </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expected to survive &lt;12 months</p><p/><p>A large study using a sample from the National Cancer Database identified patients with metastatic RCC treated with targeted agents between 2006 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Of the 15,390 patients treated with targeted agents, 5374 (35 percent) underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy. Patients who were younger, were privately insured, were treated at an academic center, and had lower tumor stage and cN0 disease were more likely to undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy. The overall survival was significantly longer in patients managed with cytoreductive nephrectomy compared with those without cytoreductive nephrectomy (median 17.1 versus 7.7 months).</p><p>While these data are provocative, they are not completely sufficient to inform the benefit of nephrectomy in these patients.

The postoperative in-hospital mortality associated with pancreatic resection was 2.8 percent. The presence of extrapancreatic RCC metastases was associated with worse disease-free survival, and symptomatic metastases were associated with worse overall survival. Surprisingly, the size of the largest tumor resected, number of pancreatic metastases, type of pancreatic resection, and interval from diagnosis of RCC to pancreatic metastasis were not predictive of survival. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348386900\"><span class=\"h3\">Local recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the majority of patients who develop a local soft tissue recurrence die of metastatic disease, the limited data suggest that resection of the recurrence may prolong survival in carefully selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].

Outside of a research protocol setting, systemic therapy should be reserved for patients with measurable disease. ECOG in the United States is currently conducting a randomized trial (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01575548&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOSCk+ujp/tzNz7MFC0hGvZ8g+8A2DNoD1Ib521/I/THuS4J0ahTSdF6pVG21oLwNMQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=9536\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT01575548</a>) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pazopanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pazopanib</a> versus placebo in patients following complete resection of stage IV disease.

This was illustrated in a series of 31 selected patients with RCC who had a partial or complete response to systemic IL-2 and then underwent resection of relapsing or residual disease; the two-year progression-free survival was 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Subsequent evaluation has confirmed that most of these patients remain disease free, with follow-up beyond 10 years in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
