The appearance of cyanosis depends upon the total amount of reduced hemoglobin rather than the ratio of reduced to oxygenated hemoglobin. Cyanosis is a common clinical finding in newborn infants. Neonatal cyanosis, particularly central cyanosis, can be associated with significant and potentially life-threatening diseases due to cardiac, metabolic, neurologic, infectious, and parenchymal and non-parenchymal pulmonary disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50161 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The etiology, evaluation, and initial management of the newborn with cyanosis will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95089272\"><span class=\"h1\">CENTRAL VERSUS PERIPHERAL CYANOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95089554\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral cyanosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with peripheral cyanosis have normal systemic arterial oxygen saturation and increased tissue oxygen extraction that leads to a widened systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference of 60 percent (from the normal 40 percent) resulting in an increased concentration of reduced hemoglobin on the venous side of the capillary bed. Peripheral cyanosis typically affects the distal extremities and sometimes the circumoral or periorbital areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cyanosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The extremities may be cool or clammy. Peripheral cyanosis may be associated with peripheral vasoconstriction or many causes associated with central cyanosis. In neonates with peripheral cyanosis, the mucus membranes remain pink, which differentiates it from central cyanosis</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95089610\"><span class=\"h3\">Acrocyanosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acrocyanosis is often seen in healthy newborns and refers to the peripheral cyanosis around the mouth and the extremities (hands and feet) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108319 \">picture 1</a>). It is caused by benign vasomotor changes that result in peripheral vasoconstriction and increased tissue oxygen extraction and is a benign condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cyanosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Acrocyanosis is differentiated from other causes of peripheral cyanosis with significant pathology (eg, septic shock) as it occurs immediately after birth in healthy infants. It is a common finding and may persist for 24 to 48 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95089279\"><span class=\"h2\">Central cyanosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central cyanosis is caused by reduced arterial oxygen saturation. Newborn infants normally have central cyanosis until up to 5 to 10 minutes after birth, as the oxygen saturation rises to 85 to 95 percent by 10 minutes of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cyanosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Persistent central cyanosis is always abnormal and should be evaluated and treated promptly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3951107006\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal central cyanosis is most commonly due to hypoxia due to one or more of the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alveolar hypoventilation &ndash; Although the primary effect of alveolar hypoventilation is hypercarbia (eg, recurrent apnea), decreased ventilation of the lung can cause hypoxemia resulting in reduced oxygen saturation and cyanosis. Causes of hypoventilation include central nervous system depression (eg, perinatal asphyxia), airway obstruction (choanal atresia), or neuromuscular disorders (eg, spinal muscular atrophy type 1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilation-perfusion mismatch &ndash; Normally, areas of decreased ventilation are matched with decreased blood flow. Alterations of this relationship can cause hypoxemia (eg, neonatal pneumonia, pneumothorax) resulting in reduced oxygen saturation and cyanosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right-to-left shunt &ndash; In right-to-left shunting, systemic venous blood bypasses ventilated alveoli and returns to the left side of the heart without being oxygenated, resulting in reduced oxygen saturation and cyanosis. The site of shunting can be intracardiac (eg, cyanotic congenital heart disease [CCHD]), through the ductus arteriosus (eg, persistent pulmonary hypertension), or intrapulmonary (eg, perfusion of non-ventilated areas of the lung). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-causes-of-cyanosis-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac causes of cyanosis in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffusion impairment &ndash; Oxygen molecules must diffuse from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillaries to oxygenate hemoglobin. Interference with alveolar-arterial diffusion (eg, pulmonary edema) results in reduced oxygen saturation.</p><p/><p>In addition, reduced arterial oxygen saturation can be caused by hemoglobinopathies that inadequately transport oxygen or polycythemia.</p><p>The etiology of persistent central cyanosis varies from a wide range of disorders that include cardiac, metabolic, neurologic, infectious, hematologic, and parenchymal and non-parenchymal pulmonary disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50161 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4142819233\" class=\"local\">'Causes of central cyanosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87792679\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS THAT AFFECT CYANOSIS DETECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following factors can affect the detection of cyanosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin concentration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal hemoglobin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin pigmentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiological conditions that affect oxygen dissociation curve</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95089307\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobin concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total hemoglobin concentration affects the level of oxygen saturation at which cyanosis can be detected because the appearance of cyanosis is dependent on the absolute concentration of reduced hemoglobin, not the ratio of reduced hemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin. Cyanosis is visually perceptible when reduced hemoglobin exceeds 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> which generally corresponds to an oxygen saturation level below 85 percent in a neonate with a hemoglobin concentration of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70325\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70325 \">figure 1</a>). However, cyanosis is detected at higher levels of oxygen saturation in polycythemic patients, whereas significant oxygen desaturation can be present in an anemic patient without clinically detectable cyanosis. As examples, cyanosis (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> of reduced hemoglobin) is detected when the oxygen saturation is 86 percent in a patient with hemoglobin of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and 67 percent in a patient with a hemoglobin concentration of 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95089314\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal hemoglobin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal hemoglobin, the predominant form of hemoglobin in newborn erythrocytes, binds oxygen more avidly than adult hemoglobin, which aids in fetal uptake of oxygen from the placenta but results in less oxygen delivery to the tissues. The oxygen dissociation curve for fetal versus adult hemoglobin is shifted to the left, so that for a given level of arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>), the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) is higher in newborns than older infants or adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59739\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59739 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cyanosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. So for a given level of SaO<sub>2</sub>, there is a lower PaO<sub>2</sub> value in newborns compared with older patients. As examples, when SaO<sub>2</sub> is 50 percent, PaO<sub>2</sub> is 20 mmHg in newborns and 27 mmHg in older patients; at SaO<sub>2</sub> of 80 percent, PaO<sub>2</sub> is 35 mmHg in newborns and 45 mmHg in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cyanosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>As a result, cyanosis is detected at a lower PaO<sub>2</sub> in newborns who have predominantly fetal hemoglobin compared with older patients. This observation should prompt the measurement of PaO<sub>2</sub> (eg, arterial blood gas) when evaluating a cyanotic newborn as the PaO<sub>2</sub> provides more complete data than SaO<sub>2</sub>. (See <a href=\"#H12812864\" class=\"local\">'Arterial blood gas'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95089764\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin pigmentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyanosis is often less apparent in patients with darker skin pigmentation. For this reason, examination should include the nail beds, tongue, and mucous membranes, which are less affected by pigmentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95089321\"><span class=\"h2\">Other physiologic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other physiologic factors common in sick newborns affect the oxygen dissociation curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59739\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59739 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that increase the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen include alkalosis, hyperventilation (low PCO<sub>2</sub>), cold temperature, and low levels of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cyanosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In these conditions, the oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the left, which decreases the concentration of reduced hemoglobin at a given PaO<sub>2</sub> and lowers the PaO<sub>2</sub> at which cyanosis first appears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, acidosis, fever, or increased concentration of adult hemoglobin shifts the curve to the right, thereby lowering oxygen affinity. As a result, at a given PaO<sub>2</sub>, these conditions increase oxygen delivery to the tissues resulting in a greater concentration of reduced hemoglobin, and promote the appearance of cyanosis at a higher PaO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3156939214\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF PERIPHERAL CYANOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral cyanosis is due to increased oxygen extraction that generally results from sluggish movement of blood through the capillary circulation.

In particular, signs of respiratory distress (tachypnea, inter- and subcostal retractions, nasal flaring, and audible grunting) are suggestive of pulmonary disease, whereas abnormal cardiac findings (eg abnormal heart rate and sounds, and pathologic murmurs) indicate a cardiac etiology.
