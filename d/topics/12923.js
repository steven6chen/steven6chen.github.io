It is broadly divided in two main types: small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) and large plaque parapsoriasis (LPP). In both types, lesions are typically asymptomatic or accompanied by mild pruritus and are predominantly located on the trunk. While SPP is generally considered a chronic benign condition, LPP is regarded as a premalignant dermatosis with a substantial risk of progression to mycosis fungoides, the most common type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma.

Both SPP and LPP occur most commonly in middle-aged or older individuals; approximately two-thirds of patients are male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapsoriasis-small-plaque-and-large-plaque-parapsoriasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11633020\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology and pathogenesis of small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) and large plaque parapsoriasis (LPP) are unknown. Both are thought to be cutaneous T cell lymphoproliferative disorders. However, whether they are precursors of mycosis fungoides (MF) or early MF from the outset (the so&#8208;called premycotic stage) is still controversial. The superficial dermal infiltrate is composed primarily of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Dominant T cell clonality has been demonstrated in many cases of LPP and in a few cases of SPP, although the presence of a dominant T cell clone does not appear to increase the malignant potential of these dermatoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapsoriasis-small-plaque-and-large-plaque-parapsoriasis/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>].</p><p>The hypothesis of a viral etiology for parapsoriasis has not been confirmed. Evidence of infection with lymphotropic viruses (eg, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesviruses [HHV] 6 and HHV8) has not been found consistently in patients with parapsoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parapsoriasis-small-plaque-and-large-plaque-parapsoriasis/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3765084808\"><span class=\"h1\">SMALL PLAQUE PARAPSORIASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) is a chronic, asymptomatic dermatosis characterized by the presence of small, persistent scaly plaques predominantly located on the trunk.

Phototherapy is generally administered two to three times per week for several months until clearance of lesions is achieved. The frequency of treatments is gradually tapered to once per week or less and then discontinued.

(See <a href=\"#H11633013\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88963253\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SPP presents with round or oval erythematous patches &lt;5 cm or elongated &quot;digitate&quot; lesions on the trunk and proximal extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87291%7EDERM%2F87292%7EDERM%2F87290\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87291 graphicRef87292 graphicRef87290 \">picture 1A-B, 2A</a>). The clinical diagnosis is supported by the histologic finding of a nonspecific dermatitis with spongiosis and a sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. (See <a href=\"#H11633027\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H56547880\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with SPP, treatment is not necessary. However, for patients who are symptomatic with pruritus or have cosmetic concerns, we suggest topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We generally use moderate to high-potency corticosteroids (groups two to four (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) once or twice a day for 8 to 12 weeks. We suggest phototherapy with broadband or narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) if topical corticosteroids are ineffective (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11633048\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LPP typically presents with erythematous lesions &gt;5 cm, irregularly shaped, frequently atrophic or poikilodermatous, and typically localized in areas not exposed to the sun (eg, lower trunk, buttocks, and thighs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87288%7EDERM%2F87289%7EDERM%2F68028%7ECALC%2F86681\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87288 graphicRef87289 graphicRef68028 graphicRef86681 \">picture 9A-D</a>). The diagnosis is based upon the clinical presentation and the histologic finding of a dense dermal infiltrate of small lymphocytes, some of which have cerebriform nuclei, and focal single-cell epidermotropism. Differentiating LPP from early mycosis fungoides may be difficult. (See <a href=\"#H3081007628\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1617258247\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2390916931\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with LPP require treatment to control pruritus and suppress the skin lesions.

Phototherapy is also appropriate when there is a lack of response to initial treatment with topical corticosteroids or disease progression despite treatment with topical corticosteroids. Phototherapy is generally administered two to three times per week for several months, until clearance of lesions is achieved.
