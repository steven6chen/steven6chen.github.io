Other issues related to RBBB and LBBB are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-bundle-branch-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right bundle branch block&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-bundle-branch-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left bundle branch block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) is more difficult when the baseline ECG shows a bundle branch block pattern that may precede or be a complication of the infarct or when the patient has a ventricular paced rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. The frequency of bundle branch block was assessed in a review of almost 300,000 infarctions from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2 investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Right bundle branch block was present in approximately 6 percent and left bundle branch block in 7 percent of infarctions. Patients with bundle branch block were significantly less likely than those without bundle branch block to receive appropriate therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or beta blockers, had more comorbid disease, and had a significant increase in in-hospital mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RIGHT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK WITH MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of right bundle branch block (RBBB) must be considered in both Q wave (ST elevation) and non-Q wave (non-ST elevation) infarctions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Q wave MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right bundle branch block does not usually interfere with the diagnosis of a Q wave myocardial infarction (MI). MI most often involves the left ventricle and therefore affects the initial phase of ventricular depolarization, sometimes producing abnormal Q waves. In contrast, right bundle branch block (RBBB) primarily affects the terminal phase of ventricular depolarization, producing a wide R' wave in the right chest leads and a wide S wave in the left chest leads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65619%7ECARD%2F64393\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65619 graphicRef64393 \">waveform 1A-B</a>). These changes are due to delayed depolarization of the right ventricle, while depolarization of the left ventricle is not affected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-bundle-branch-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right bundle branch block&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The net effect is that the electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns are combined when complete RBBB and a Q wave infarct occur together, and the criteria for the diagnosis of a Q wave MI are the same as in patients with normal conduction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to the bundle branch block, the QRS complex will be abnormally wide (0.12 sec or more), lead V1 will show a terminal positive deflection, and lead V6 will show a terminal negative deflection (wide S wave).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the infarction is anterior, there will be a loss of R wave progression with abnormal Q waves in the anterior leads and characteristic ST-T changes; if the infarction is inferior, Q waves will appear in leads II, III, and aVF.</p><p/><p>There are, however, problems that can occur with interpretation of the ECG in patients with RBBB and acute MI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large clinical trials in which serial ECGs are performed have shown both false-positive and false-negative diagnoses of MI in the presence of RBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After revascularization, for example, Q wave durations in patients who develop RBBB can shorten significantly, primarily in the inferior leads, suggesting that the initial orientation of wavefronts can change and that false-negative results may be obtained in patients with inferior infarctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There has been a case report of a woman with an acute anterior MI in whom the initial ECG revealed a small R wave in leads V1 and V4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These R waves were replaced by Q waves after the development of RBBB associated with PR-interval prolongation, suggesting extension of the infarction. However, the Q waves disappeared with resolution of the RBBB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The coexistence of left anterior fascicular block with or without RBBB can be associated with Q waves suggestive of an anterior MI; in this setting, the altered initial vector is attributed to the left anterior fascicular block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These Q waves can often be distinguished from pathologic Q waves in an acute MI by their short duration (0.02 sec versus 0.04 to 0.05 sec with an infarction) and their presence in only leads V2 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> V3.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A new posterior wall infarct in the presence of RBBB might be expected to increase the anterior forces in the right precordial leads but this has not been systematically studied.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-Q wave MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There may be some diagnostic difficulties in interpreting the ECG in patients with RBBB who have a non-Q wave MI. RBBB is typically associated with secondary ST-T changes due to abnormal right ventricular repolarization. Thus, leads with an R' wave (leads V1, V2, and sometimes V3) will show T wave inversions. In contrast, ST depressions or T wave inversions in leads with a terminal S wave (leads V5 and V6) cannot be attributed to the RBBB alone. Such ST-T changes may be due to ischemia, or to other factors such as drug effects (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>) or electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia. Note that the Brugada pattern may simulate RBBB with acute or evolving ST elevation MI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brugada-syndrome-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H2769795303\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'ECG findings'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK WITH MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is present in approximately 7 percent of acute infarctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The diagnosis of myocardial (MI) in the presence of LBBB is considerably more complicated and confusing than that of right bundle branch block (RBBB). The reason is that LBBB alters both the early and the mid to late phases of ventricular depolarization, and also produces secondary ST-T changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52836%7ECARD%2F61594\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52836 graphicRef61594 \">waveform 2A-B</a>). </p><p>Two issues need to be addressed: the impact of LBBB on the diagnosis of acute MI and the effect on diagnosis of a prior MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. There are issues that vary with the site of the infarct and there are changes that are independent of the site of the infarct, such as the ST-T changes that can occur. Because of these difficulties, careful attention to the strength of the clinical history and confirmation of the diagnosis of an acute MI by cardiac enzyme elevations are essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sequence of repolarization is altered in LBBB, with the ST segment and T wave vectors being directed <strong>opposite</strong> to the QRS complex. These changes may mask the ST segment depression and T wave inversion induced by ischemia. On the other hand, the diagnosis of an acute MI or ischemia can occasionally be made in a patient with underlying LBBB if certain ST-T changes are seen, particularly if the ST-T vectors are in the same direction as the QRS complex as in the Sgarbossa criteria described below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of deep T wave inversions in leads with a predominantly negative QRS complex (eg, V1-V3) is highly suggestive of evolving ischemia or MI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST elevations in leads with a predominant R wave (as opposed to QS or rS waves) are also strongly suggestive of acute ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudonormalization of previously inverted T waves is suggestive but not diagnostic of ischemia.</p><p/><p>The importance of accurate diagnosis in patients with LBBB is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proportion of patients with LBBB and acute chest pain having an acute MI in different studies has been between 13 to 32 percent, with a lower incidence in community-based studies compared to clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. As a result, inaccurate diagnosis can lead to both undertreatment of patients with an MI and unnecessary overtreatment of patients without an MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. In one report, for example, thrombolysis was given to only 73 percent of eligible patients with LBBB and an acute MI and to 48 percent of patients with LBBB and chest pain but no biochemical evidence of infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. None of the latter patients satisfied the Sgarbossa criteria described below for an acute MI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to difficulties in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, approximately one-half of patients with LBBB and an acute MI do not have chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These patients are much less likely to receive appropriate medical therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, beta blockers) or reperfusion therapy than LBBB patients with chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Attempts to improve ECG diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have systematically evaluated the value of different ECG findings of acute MI in LBBB. A classical analysis by Wackers correlated ECG changes in LBBB with localization of the infarct by thallium scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most useful ECG criteria were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial ECG changes &ndash; 67 percent sensitivity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST segment elevation &ndash; 54 percent sensitivity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal Q waves &ndash; 31 percent sensitivity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial positivity in V1 with a Q wave in V6 &ndash; 20 percent sensitivity but 100 percent specificity for anteroseptal MI.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cabrera's sign &ndash; 27 percent sensitivity overall, 47 percent for anteroseptal MI.<br/><br/>Note: Cabrera's sign refers to prominent (about 0.05 sec) notching in the ascending limb of the S wave in leads V3 and V4; a similar finding is prominent notching of the ascending limb of the R wave in lead V5 or V6 (Chapman's sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These signs have a specificity that approaches 90 percent. However, there may be a high degree of interobserver variability in accurate identification and their sensitivity is quite low.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Sgarbossa criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large, historic trial of thrombolytic therapy for acute MI (GUSTO-1) provided an opportunity to revisit the issue of the electrocardiographic diagnosis of evolving acute MI in the presence of LBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among 26,003 North American patients who had a myocardial infarction confirmed by enzyme studies, 131 (0.5 percent) had LBBB. A scoring system, often called the Sgarbossa criteria, was developed from the coefficients assigned by a logistic model for each independent criterion, on a scale of 0 to 5.</p><p>The three ECG criteria with an independent value in the diagnosis of acute infarction and the score for each were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST segment elevation of 1 mm or more that is in the same direction (concordant) as the QRS complex in any lead &ndash; score 5.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST segment depression of 1 mm or more in any lead from V1 to V3 &ndash; score 3.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST segment elevation of 5 mm or more that is discordant with the QRS complex (ie, associated with a QS or rS complex) &ndash; score 2. However, prominent J point elevations may occur in V1-V2 solely due to left ventricular hypertrophy or in other settings. Therefore, a ratio (in absolute units) in any relevant lead of the amplitude of the ST elevation to the S wave amplitude exceeding 0.25 has been proposed as having greater accuracy than the original Sgarbossa criterion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Additional studies are needed to test this ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">ST/S</span> wave ratio sign in LBBB and with right ventricular pacemakers.</p><p/><p>A minimal score of 3 was required for a specificity of 90 percent. The first two criteria are similar to those described above since the ST segment is concordant rather than discordant with the QRS complex. However, the third finding requires further validation, since a high take-off of the ST segment in leads V1 to V3 has been described with uncomplicated LBBB, particularly if there is underlying left ventricular hypertrophy. In a substudy from the ASSENT 2 and 3 trials, the third criteria added little diagnostic or prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A subsequent study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] proposed normalizing the amplitude of J <span class=\"nowrap\">point/ST</span> elevation in right precordial leads (and in other leads, a negative QRS) by the depth of the S waves in those leads. However, this <span class=\"nowrap\">&ldquo;ST/S</span> wave&rdquo; ratio approach remains to be validated.</p><p>A number of the other criteria, including those of Wackers mentioned above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], were not found to be useful. A difference may be that the GUSTO criteria were applied within hours of the MI as part of the GUSTO-1 trial, while those of Wackers were often applied much longer after the acute event. Furthermore, only the Wackers study attempted to localize the infarct.</p><p>A Sgarbossa score of &ge;3 was highly specific (ie, few false positives) but much less sensitive (36 percent) in the validation sample in the original report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Similar findings were noted in a subsequent meta-analysis of 10 studies of 1614 patients in which a Sgarbossa score of &ge;3 had a sensitivity of 20 percent and a specificity of 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The sensitivity may increase if serial or previous ECGs are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In addition to their utility in diagnosis, the Sgarbossa criteria may also predict prognosis in patients with acute MI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conduction abnormalities after myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A similar problem is the diagnosis of an acute MI in the presence of a ventricular paced rhythm, which is usually associated with a left bundle branch block pattern. Thirty-two patients in the GUSTO-1 trial (0.1 percent of enrolled patients) had a ventricular paced rhythm. The only ECG criterion with a high specificity and statistical significance for the diagnosis of an acute MI was ST segment elevation &ge;5 mm in leads with a negative QRS complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Two other criteria with acceptable specificity were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST elevation &ge;1 mm in leads with concordant QRS polarity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST depression &ge;1 mm in leads V1, V2, or, V3</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in the sequence of depolarization in LBBB can also mask typical findings associated with prior transmural (Q wave) infarctions. Certain ECG patterns, however, may suggest prior infarction despite LBBB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Left ventricular free wall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infarction of the left ventricular free (or lateral) wall ordinarily results in abnormal Q waves in the midprecordial to lateral precordial leads (and selected limb leads). However, the initial septal depolarization forces with LBBB are directed from right to left. These leftward forces produce an initial R wave in the mid to lateral precordial leads, usually masking the loss of potential (Q waves) caused by the infarction. As a result, acute or chronic left ventricular free wall infarction by itself will not usually produce diagnostic Q waves in the presence of LBBB.</p><p>If, however, the loss of lateral force is sufficiently large, late rightward forces generated by other portions of the left ventricle may predominate, possibly resulting in S waves in I, aVL, and V6. Thus, an anterolateral MI should be suspected in the appropriate clinical setting if new S waves appear in leftward leads in a patient with pre-existing common LBBB. This is an old concept that makes electrophysiologic and vectorcardiographic sense; however, it requires further clinical validation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Anteroseptal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of LBBB has a variable effect on the ECG changes that can occur with anteroseptal MI. Perhaps most important, the leftward shift in the initial vector in LBBB causes the loss of normal septal q waves in the left-right leads, I, aVL, and V6. Furthermore, the leftward and posterior orientation of the initial vector often results in a QS pattern in the anterior leads, V1 and sometimes in V2. These changes can mask the presence of an anteroseptal MI.</p><p>There are, however, other changes that can occur that may suggest the presence of an anteroseptal or septal MI. The infarct may cause the leftwardly directed initial vector of LBBB to shift to the right, resulting in &quot;pseudonormalization&quot; of the initial vector and the reappearance of q waves in I, aVL and V6. If enough of the septum is infarcted, abnormal QR, QRS, or qrS types of complexes may appear in the mid- to lateral precordial leads in conjunction with the LBBB pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Free wall and septal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute or chronic infarction involving both the free wall and the septum may produce abnormal Q waves (usually as part of QRS or QrS types of complexes) in leads V4 to V6. These initial Q waves probably reflect posterior and superior forces from the spared basal portion of the septum. Small q waves (0.03 sec or less) may be seen in leads I and V5 to V6 with uncomplicated LBBB. Thus, wide Q waves (0.04 sec) in one or more of these leads are a more reliable sign of underlying infarction. As an example, wide Q waves (as part of QR complexes) in V6, particularly with an R wave in V1, appear to be a specific, although relatively insensitive, marker of anterior infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Inferior wall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a retrospective analysis, 35 patients with LBBB and an unequivocal inferior MI on thallium imaging were compared to 131 patients with LBBB without an inferior wall MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
