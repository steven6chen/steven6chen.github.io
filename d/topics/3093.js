Caustic ingestions are seen most often in young children between one and three years of age, and can cause severe acute injury and long-term complications, especially the development of esophageal strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>The evaluation and management of a child with suspected ingestion of a caustic substance is described here.

In 2015, 2.2 million toxic exposures in humans were reported in the United States, of which about half occurred in children five years or younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The most commonly ingested caustic substances were household cleaning products (particularly household bleach), which accounted for 11 percent of the toxic ingestions in young children and cosmetics or personal care products. Caustic ingestion is most common in young children between one and three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], with boys accounting for 50 to 62 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>Most ingestions by children are accidental and the amounts ingested tend to be small. The opposite is the case in adolescents and adults, in whom ingestion often is deliberate and related to attempted suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In such cases, the amount ingested may be large and the injury to the esophagus and stomach often severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cases of alkali ingestion as a result of child abuse have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4134275851\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF CAUSTIC SUBSTANCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substance is caustic if it is capable of burning or corroding organic tissue by chemical action, typically due to strong acid or alkaline properties.</p><p>Common caustic ingestions are of household cleaning products, including household bleach, or oven and drain cleaners, which are strong lyes that contain sodium and potassium hydroxides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/1,7,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,13,14</a>]. Other common cleaning products include laundry and dishwasher detergents, and cleaning agents with sodium phosphate, sodium carbonate, and ammonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/2,3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,15</a>]. Other caustic ingestions include cosmetic products such as hair relaxer, swimming pool products, and toilet bowl cleaners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Alkaline agents are more commonly ingested compared with acidic agents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1703586790\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3408247831\"><span class=\"h2\">Acid versus alkali</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alkalis and acids produce tissue injury by different mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alkali </strong>&ndash; Alkaline agents tend to cause esophageal injury if the pH is above 11.5-12.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], via liquefaction necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This type of injury leads to early disintegration of the mucosa, allowing deep penetration and even perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Penetration into the esophageal wall by alkaline agents varies with the concentration and the length of time the agent remains in contact with the mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Experimentally, a 10 percent solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) may require as long as one minute of contact to produce a deep burn, whereas a 30 percent sodium hydroxide can cause transmural esophageal necrosis within one second of contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In animal experiments, even weakly concentrated alkaline agents (eg, 1.8 percent sodium hydroxide) can produce superficial necrosis if left in contact with the mucosa for one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acids</strong> &ndash; Acids or corrosive agents tend to cause esophageal injury if the pH is less than 2, via coagulation necrosis. As compared with alkali agents, esophageal injury from acids tend to be attenuated and perforation is less common because the coagulum that forms on the mucosal surface may limit deeper penetration of the caustic substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The alkaline pH and squamous epithelium of the esophagus also help limit the severity of esophageal injury from acids. Despite these mitigating factors, 6 to 20 percent of acid ingestions result in esophageal burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/4,20,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20,22,23</a>]. Upper airway injuries also are common with ingestion of acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3628329722\" class=\"local\">'Airway injury'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2961375283\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the initial necrosis (whether caused by alkali or acid), additional destruction takes place over the first week caused by inflammation and vascular thrombosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68864\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68864 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. By 10 days there is formation of granulation tissue and weakening of the esophageal wall. During this early period, the esophagus is increasingly vulnerable to perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/7,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,26</a>]. By three weeks, fibrogenesis and stricture formation are well under way, and perforation is less likely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2490971480\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS OF SPECIFIC SUBSTANCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk and severity of injury is affected by the corrosive properties of the ingested substance (eg, the pH) (see <a href=\"#H3408247831\" class=\"local\">'Acid versus alkali'</a> above), but also by the amount, concentration, and physical form of the agent (eg, solid or liquid), and the duration of contact with the mucosa. The approximate pH of various cleaning products are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110162\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110162 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal burns account for most of the serious injuries and leads to the chronic complications associated with toxic ingestions, and have been reported in 18 to 46 percent of caustic ingestions in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/7,22,27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22,27-31</a>]. Injury to the lips, oropharynx, and upper airway also may occur.</p><p>The likelihood of esophageal injury depends in part on the substance ingested:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard liquid household detergents, phosphates, and bleaches have pHs ranging from 9 to 11, and rarely cause serious injuries unless taken in large amounts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/7,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, concentrated forms of laundry or dishwasher detergent, especially single-use packets (&quot;capsules,&quot; &quot;gel packs,&quot; or &quot;pods&quot;) are increasingly available and are much more likely to cause esophageal injury. These have caused multiple cases of esophageal injury and airway compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Other common complications with these products are contact dermatitis, and corneal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These products typically are small and colorful, looking somewhat like candy. In 2012, the AAPCC issued a <a href=\"http://www.aapcc.org/alerts/laundry-detergent-packets/&amp;token=TCZoDJKkgSsgDea9026wfEXAHWFxOR39TyhxWG0Qagqy0KikNA0EkKJQmXImawN06qnyCQvieuMT7ShsgidBng==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5862\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">safety warning</a> about this new type of product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In 2018, the AAPCC issued a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.aapcc.org/press/84/&amp;token=TCZoDJKkgSsgDea9026wfNrtjpQTs2HyRMtgogOrQMLw+K/dsCdbJX/LI8pLoP3e&amp;TOPIC_ID=5862\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">high alert</a>&quot; about a sharp increase in laundry pod ingestions among teenagers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These were intentional exposures, apparently in response to a &quot;challenge&quot; on social media. In addition to esophageal injury, these exposures also have been associated with respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and occasionally coma and death. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Household bleaches are relatively common ingestions, but rarely cause esophageal burns. These are typically composed of about 5 percent sodium hypochlorite and have a pH of approximately 11, which is below the pH threshold of 11.5 to 12.5 that tends to cause esophageal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/3,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,19</a>]. When burns do occur with these agents, they tend to be mild and do not require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/16,20,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20,40</a>]. Industrial strength bleaches or household bleaches from other countries may be much more corrosive because of a higher concentration of sodium hypochlorite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Button batteries lodged in the esophagus can rapidly cause injury to the esophagus and critical surrounding structures, in part due to leakage of alkaline material. This issue is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Button and cylindrical battery ingestion: Clinical features, diagnosis, and initial management&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cosmetic products such as hair relaxers are ingested commonly, but they appear to be rare causes of esophageal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In one review of 29 patients with hair relaxer ingestions who underwent upper endoscopy, 6 patients (20 percent) had esophageal mucosal injury and 5 patients (17 percent) had gastric mucosal injury, but these injuries were limited to grade 1 (superficial) injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Wart or callus removers containing salicylic acid have caused esophageal injury and scarring in case reports; the colloid suspension is viscous, which likely contributes to the injury by prolonging contact with the mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common acid household products include toilet bowl cleaners, battery fluids, and muriatic (hydrochloric) acid used in swimming pools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/2,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,46</a>]. Children living on farms may be at particularly high risk for incurring serious burns because industrial-strength agents are more commonly used in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solid caustic materials, which tend to adhere to the mucosa, can produce deep burns of the oral cavity and esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], but they are less likely to reach the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The immediate and severe pain produced by these products may limit the amount ingested and thus lessen the extent of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Powdered or granular detergents tend to injure the upper airway; esophageal injury is less common but has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/17,36,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,36,49</a>].

In addition, older reports may have underestimated the presence of gastric injury because of the use of rigid endoscopes that frequently were not advanced beyond the first visible esophageal burn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In a review in which flexible endoscopes were used to evaluate 156 children with caustic ingestion, 11 percent had both esophageal and gastric burns, and 9 percent had gastric burns only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Among patients with alkaline ingestions, gastric injury is most common in those who ingest relatively large volumes (200 to 300 mL); in one series of such patients, gastric injury was seen in more than 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Large ingestions have resulted in gastric perforation, hemorrhage, and death from erosion into a bronchial vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Gastric injury often is most severe with acids, such as sulfuric acid, which trigger antral spasm, leading to pooling of acid in the antrum, which may cause severe burns in the prepyloric area and result in pyloric obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a review of 98 children with ingestion of acid substances, 8 (8.2 percent) developed gastric outlet obstruction at a mean of 27 days after ingestion, necessitating gastrojejunostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In a smaller series of 20 patients with gastric outlet obstruction, two also had esophageal strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Duodenal erosions have been reported in occasional cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20530379\" class=\"local\">'Pyloric stenosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3628329722\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper airway injuries are more common with ingestion of acids, perhaps related to their bad taste, which tends to stimulate gagging, choking, and attempts to spit out the ingested material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Powdered or granular detergents also tend to injure the upper airway, resulting in stridor and epiglottitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of caustic ingestions vary widely. Early signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms may not correlate with the severity and extent of tissue injury, particularly in young children. </p><p>The following symptoms are common after a caustic ingestion: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal tract injury</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common symptom is dysphagia which can occur even with mild esophageal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This symptom may be caused by loss of esophageal motility during the acute phase of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], similar to what is seen in peptic esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Esophageal dysmotility and prolonged esophageal transit time may persist for several weeks following severe esophageal burns. Persistent dysphagia also may be caused by fibrosis of deeper muscle layers, with or without stricture formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Fibrosis alone produces a decrease in the amplitude of esophageal contractions and elevated basal pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of dysphagia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients may also present with drooling, retrosternal or abdominal pain, hematemesis. Deep esophageal burns can be complicated by esophageal perforation, which can cause mediastinitis and the development of a tracheoesophageal fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper airway injury</strong> &ndash; Symptoms suggesting upper airway injury include stridor, hoarseness, nasal flaring, and retractions. Such symptoms suggest injury to the epiglottis, which can be severe, especially in children younger than two years of age, and may require emergency intubation or tracheotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/17,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,55</a>]. Although symptoms of upper airway injury usually begin rapidly after contact with caustic agents, there may be a one- to two-hour delay with ingestion of powdered agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Occasionally, the clinical presentation may mimic anaphylaxis, leading to misdiagnosis if the history of caustic ingestion is not revealed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p/><p>The presence or absence of any of the clinical features described above does not reliably predict ingestion or the presence or severity of esophageal or gastric burns. In a single series of 378 caustic ingestions in children, 12 percent had no symptoms but had severe esophageal burns, whereas 82 percent who were symptomatic at presentation had minimal or no esophageal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The presence or absence of oral lesions also is a poor predictor of esophageal injury. In a review of multiple case series totaling 489 children, 45 percent without oral burns had esophageal burns, and 54 percent with oral burns had accompanying esophageal burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic evaluation and management of a patient with a known or suspected caustic ingestion depends on whether the patient is symptomatic, tempered by the type of agent ingested. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145504311\"><span class=\"h2\">History and examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should seek to establish the timing of the exposure, including whether it was directly observed by a caretaker, and an estimation of the amount of the substance ingested.

The patient should be closely evaluated for respiratory compromise, including the presence or absence of stridor, hoarseness, nasal flaring, retractions, and wheezing. Drooling, food refusal or complaints of dysphagia suggest oropharyngeal or esophageal injury. The lips and oropharynx should be inspected for burns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93916 \">picture 1</a>). However, the presence or absence of oral burns is a poor predictor of esophageal injury, as noted above. </p><p>Signs that suggest the possibility of esophageal perforation include persistent severe retrosternal or back pain, especially if fever is present suggesting mediastinitis. Localized severe abdominal tenderness, rebound, and rigidity suggest the possibility of gastric perforation with peritonitis.</p><p>Other considerations that should be explored by the history and examination include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of toxic effects in addition to the potential caustic injury, which depends on the nature of the substance ingested.

The goal is to evaluate for other possible causes of the respiratory symptoms (including foreign body or pneumonia), as well as for possible complications of the caustic ingestion, such as esophageal or gastric perforation. Signs of perforation include pneumomediastinum mediastinal widening, subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, hydropneumothorax, or subdiaphragmatic air. A chest radiograph generally is not necessary in asymptomatic patients. </p><p>Radiologic contrast studies (upper gastrointestinal series) generally are not valuable in the initial stages of the evaluation because they are unreliable in detecting acute injury or in predicting stricture formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/8,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,57</a>]. Contrast studies may be appropriate in the initial stages in selected patients in whom there is a clinical suspicion of esophageal perforation based on findings from plain radiography or endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]; in this case, only water-soluble contrast should be used, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a>. </p><p>Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is sometimes needed to evaluate patients for the possibility of esophageal perforation with erosion into vascular structures, including an aortoesophageal fistula. A few cases of life-threatening or fatal hemorrhage have been reported, most of which were caused by button battery ingestion and presented with a sentinel bleed (hematemesis or melena) up to two weeks after removal of the battery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

The induction of vomiting is <strong>contraindicated</strong> because vomiting may lead to additional esophageal injury if gastric contents come in contact with the esophageal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

In the presence of acute airway swelling and obstruction, diluting agents clearly are contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition, the amount of milk or other fluids that would be necessary to significantly dilute a caustic agent is too large to make such therapy practical. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of activated charcoal generally is not recommended for children who have ingested acidic or alkaline corrosives (eg, sodium or potassium hydroxide, or hydrochloric or sulfuric acid). This is because charcoal will obstruct the view of the endoscopist and because these small, highly ionized chemicals are poorly absorbed by charcoal.

The observation period is particularly important for children who may have ingested a powdered caustic agent, for which the effects may be delayed by several hours after the ingestion. If the patient remains asymptomatic with normal swallowing <strong>and</strong> if the suspected substance is known to be of low causticity (eg, household bleach), or if it is unclear from the history whether the patient ingested a caustic substance, then the patient is at low risk for complications and endoscopy usually is unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/22,27,40,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27,40,62,63</a>]. By contrast, endoscopy is appropriate for patients who are suspected to have ingested a more caustic substance (eg, drain cleaner) or substance of questionable causticity, even if they are asymptomatic. This is because the presence or absence of symptoms in young children is not a reliable predictor of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207480933\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with symptoms should be admitted to the hospital and closely monitored. Those with significant airway compromise (stridor or retractions) may require intensive care, endotracheal intubation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tracheostomy. All patients with symptoms also should be evaluated with upper endoscopy, to evaluate the extent of the injury, unless endoscopy is contraindicated because of respiratory compromise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70113\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70113 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145504519\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper endoscopy should be performed in all patients who are symptomatic, who have oral burns, or are known to have ingested a substance with a high risk of esophageal injury. The endoscopy ideally should be performed within 24 hours of the ingestion to evaluate the extent of injury, predict prognosis, and guide management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/29,31,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,64,65</a>]. While there is little data to determine the ideal timing of endoscopy, very early endoscopy (eg, less than six hours after the ingestion) may not show the full extent of the injury, and endoscopy after four days increases the risk of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/7,19,29,31,62,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19,29,31,62,64</a>]. Endoscopy is contraindicated in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, have severe respiratory distress or evidence of perforation on imaging (see <a href=\"#H603782310\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above), or exhibit severe oropharyngeal or glottic edema and necrosis. </p><p>If the endoscopy demonstrates significant esophageal burns (grade 2A or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77228 \">table 2</a>)), we suggest follow-up evaluation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> contrast studies two to three weeks post ingestion, even if the patient is asymptomatic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70113\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70113 \">algorithm 1</a>). Alternatively, it is reasonable to manage asymptomatic patients with close clinical follow-up and perform a contrast study only if they develop symptoms suggestive of a stricture (see <a href=\"#H20530365\" class=\"local\">'Stricture formation'</a> below). Collaboration with otolaryngology to evaluate the airway may be needed, depending on the symptoms. </p><p>Flexible video endoscopes are typically used for this evaluation. Unless the esophageal burns are very severe (raising concerns about perforation), it is important to pass the endoscope beyond the first burn and into the stomach, to fully evaluate the extent of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93918%7EGAST%2F62223\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93918 graphicRef62223 \">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/7,10,29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,29,31</a>]. The endoscopist should specifically observe the vocal cords to evaluate for airway injury. Flexible endoscopy may be performed under conscious (intravenous) sedation in many patients, but general anesthesia should be used for those with severe burns or with upper airway signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Rigid endoscopes are still used in some centers, but because they are associated with higher risks of perforation as compared with flexible endoscopes, they usually are not advanced beyond the first significant esophageal burn, which limits their diagnostic utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145505620\"><span class=\"h3\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A grading system for esophageal injury helps to predict clinical outcomes and guide management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77228 \">table 2</a>).

A NGT should not be inserted blindly because perforation or additional injury can occur while passing the tube. </p><p>The NGT can provide a route for nutritional support during the healing phase and help maintain a lumen during stricture formation. It also can serve as a guide for esophageal dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. There is no need to put the NGT to suction, unless a patient has nausea, vomiting or concern for obstruction or peritonitis. (See <a href=\"#H145504311\" class=\"local\">'History and examination'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrostomy tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with severe extensive esophageal burns, consideration should be given to placement of a gastrostomy during or shortly after the initial endoscopic evaluation. A gastrostomy can be used for feeding and also for retrograde dilation of strictures. If retrograde dilation is anticipated, a string can be placed from the nose to the gastrostomy, which is used to guide the dilators. Unlike an NGT, which can be pulled out inadvertently and may be impossible to replace, a string is less likely to be pulled out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145505684\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is common practice to give antibiotics prophylactically to selected patients with caustic esophageal injury, but there are no clear standards or studies to guide patient selection. In our practice, we administer antibiotics for patients with suspicion of perforation on chest radiograph or endoscopy, and for those with grade 3 burns (endoscopic evidence of necrosis). We use a third-generation cephalosporin. </p><p>We do not recommend treatment with glucocorticoids for patients with caustic esophageal injuries, but there is ongoing study in this area. Although early studies in animals suggested that glucocorticoids prevented esophageal scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/18,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,67,68</a>], studies in humans have shown no benefit and possible harm. As an example, in a randomized trial in children, administration of glucocorticoids had no effect on strictures, which developed in 20 to 38 percent of documented esophageal burns, regardless of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This is particularly true for patients with third-degree burns, in whom stricture formation appears to be inevitable regardless of therapy. In addition, perforation is also common in such patients, the presentation of which can be masked by glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similar conclusions were reached by systematic reviews of patients with grade 2 or 3 burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Contrasting results were found in a randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> for three days) versus placebo in 83 children with grade 2B esophageal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Subjects in both groups were also treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ceftriaxone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ranitidine</a>. Rates of stricture development were lower in the glucocorticoid-treated group (14.3 versus 45 percent, as assessed by radiography, and 10.8 versus 30 percent as assessed by endoscopy). These findings suggest a possible benefit of a brief course of high-dose corticosteroids in the subset of patients with deep focal or circumferential ulcers (grade 2B). However, because these findings contrast with the results of several previous trials, additional research is needed to clarify the role of glucocorticoids in patients with caustic esophageal injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caustic esophageal injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Esophageal strictures'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common complication of caustic ingestion is stricture formation, which can cause esophageal obstruction, presenting with dysphagia. Patients with severe gastric injury may develop pyloric stenosis. Caustic ingestion also confers an increased risk for developing esophageal carcinoma, as described below. Eosinophilic esophagitis developing after caustic ingestion has been described in a case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20530365\"><span class=\"h2\">Stricture formation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H117960814\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stricture formation is the primary complication of caustic injury, occurring in 3 to 57 percent of ingestions with documented esophageal burns, and in virtually all patients with severe circumferential burns (grade 2B or 3 in the scheme outlined above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/4,5,7,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,29</a>]. More superficial or non-circumferential burns (grade 1 or 2A) are less likely to result in strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], although one report found that half of the children with non-circumferential transmucosal burns (grade 2A) went on to develop esophageal stricture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. A few older reports described patients with apparently normal endoscopic findings who went on to develop strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but it seems likely that a burn was present but was missed because the endoscopy was performed with a rigid endoscope. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3717146560\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with significant esophageal burns (grade 2A or higher) should be evaluated with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagogram to assess for stricture formation. The study should be performed two to three weeks after the ingestion, or sooner if the patient develops dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), which suggests esophageal obstruction. Alternative imaging such as water-soluble contrast agents should be used if a perforation is suspected. </p><p>Most patients who develop a stricture will have obstructive symptoms within two months. In patients with the most severe burns, there may be complete obstruction within three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. At six weeks, the esophagram shows a long constriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74287\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74287 \">image 1</a>). Patients with severe strictures commonly have recurrent symptoms after two years, despite repeated dilation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479668030\"><span class=\"h3\">Dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a stricture is confirmed radiologically, esophageal dilation usually is required to maintain or reestablish normal swallowing. Balloon dilators under endoscopic control are our preferred approach; bougies also may be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53496\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53496 \">picture 3</a>). The endoscopic appearance of a stricture prior to dilation demonstrates an abrupt tapering in the mucosa. This can be mild, with mucosal edema and erythema, or more pronounced, with friability, erosive changes, whitish plaques, and fibrinous material. In more severe cases there may be blistering or frank necroinflammatory changes. </p><p>For patients who develop strictures, the optimal time for beginning dilation has not been established. Most clinicians wait three to six weeks after the initial injury before beginning dilation because there is some evidence that performing earlier dilation will increase the risk of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>]. However, two retrospective series in children suggest that strictures were less likely to be recurrent if they were treated with early dilation (7 to 28 days after the injury) versus later dilation (beginning 4 weeks or more after the injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. </p><p>A variety of dilators can be used, including balloon dilators, silicone or tungsten bougies, Maloney antegrade dilators, or Tucker dilators (used for retrograde dilation); some dilators can be passed over a string or guide wire. Because caustic strictures appear to perforate easily, retrograde dilation has been considered the safest method, although this method requires a gastrostomy and a string for guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The risk of perforation probably depends on many factors, including the cause of the stricture (perforation appears to be more common in caustic strictures as compared with those due to esophageal atresia), interval of time since injury, length and diameter of the stricture, total number of previous dilations, and operative technique (operator experience and selection of maximal dilation) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-endoscopic-esophageal-stricture-dilation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of endoscopic esophageal stricture dilation&quot;, section on 'Esophageal perforation'</a>). The techniques used for children are similar to those for adults, except that the maximal dilation of the esophagus is smaller for a child. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of benign esophageal strictures&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Balloon dilators under endoscopic control are commonly used in children and are our preferred approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>]. In theory, perforation should be less likely with balloon dilation because only radially directed force is exerted, as compared with use of a bougie, in which there is also a longitudinal shearing force. The reported rates of esophageal perforation for balloon dilation range from 1.6 to 13 percent per procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/78,80,83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,80,83-86</a>], as compared with 5.6 percent for bougienage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Balloons come in a variety of sizes and lengths. The size of the balloon dilator is selected using an estimate of the esophageal lumen diameter. One group selects a balloon catheter with a diameter equal to the interpeduncular distance of the child's thoracic spine, as measured on a pre-procedure radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Dilation balloons are available as small as 2 mm (these are designed for biliary dilation), and these can be used for the tightest strictures. For strictures narrower than 2 to 3 mm, dilation balloons with a wire guide may prevent creating a &quot;false-track&quot; in which the balloon may pass through damaged tissue along the mucosal surfaces rather than through the esophageal lumen. </p><p>The use of fluoroscopy varies widely among institutions. This technique may be of greatest benefit for patients with small diameter lumen or near-complete occlusion; in patients where there is a high concern of perforation based on endoscopic findings; or in those with a prior history of perforation. Fluoroscopy can be used for any dilation technique, and is used to identify the &quot;waist&quot; of the stricture (the area of narrowing relative to the non-dilated areas proximal and distal to the stricture). Fluoroscopy also can demonstrate leaks or other procedure-related adverse events.</p><p>Although esophageal dilation may be beneficial initially, repeated dilations usually are needed. Only 33 to 48 percent of patients with caustic strictures have long-term success with repeated dilations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29</a>]. The remaining patients, who often have long strictures, have increasing difficulty in swallowing because of progressive obstruction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3800473459\"><span class=\"h3\">Other interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preliminary data suggests that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C, an inhibitor of fibroblast proliferation, helps to prevent recurrent stricture formation in patients with severe caustic esophageal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/87-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-91</a>]. Mitomycin C is applied topically to the strictured area of the esophagus at the end of a dilation session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. In a randomized trial in 40 patients with localized caustic esophageal strictures (&lt;3 cm in length), treatment with mitomycin C was associated with a reduced need for repeated dilation (3.85 versus 6.9 dilation sessions), and higher rates of complete resolution during the six-month follow-up period (80 versus 35 percent resolution), as compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Similar results were seen in an international retrospective case series in which topical mitomycin C was successful in eliminating or reducing the need for repeated dilations in 82 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Mitomycin C typically is used as a second- or third-line agent, for strictures deemed resistant to repeated dilation or steroid injections. </p><p>Esophageal stenting has been described in limited series for use in management of refractory caustic esophageal strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. Stents have also been used in children after surgery for congenital strictures and esophageal injury from batteries, with mixed success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/93,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,95</a>]. Most data is from studies of fully covered nitinol self-expanding plastic in adults, but other nonmetal stents continue to be developed. The use of expandable uncovered metal stents for benign esophageal strictures is not recommended because of a high incidence of complications and difficulty in removal. The use of biodegradable stents has been reported in adults with caustic ingestion, but has not been studied in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Although colon interposition can be successful, many patients have persistent difficulty swallowing. Complications of colon interposition surgery include anastomotic strictures that may require periodic dilation and gastrocolic ulceration caused by reflux of gastric contents into the neoesophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20530372\"><span class=\"h2\">Carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma develops in approximately 2 percent of individuals with severe caustic esophageal injury.

As a result, some authors now recommend resection of the esophagus at the time of bypass with colon interposition. </p><p>In one study of 63 patients with lye ingestion, the mean latency period for development of esophageal cancer was 41 years with a range of 13 to 71 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. For those who have had colonic interposition surgery, the time interval between ingestion and the detection of tumor has ranged from 16 to 42 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Based on these and other data, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recommends beginning endoscopic surveillance 15 to 20 years after the caustic ingestion. </p><p>Any patient with a history of caustic ingestion and the late onset or worsening of dysphagia should be evaluated promptly, and carcinoma should be suspected until proved otherwise. Since carcinomas tend to occur in strictured areas, they are often resectable.

Injury to the lips, oropharynx, and upper airway also may occur. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3408247831\" class=\"local\">'Acid versus alkali'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common causes of caustic esophageal burns are alkaline household cleaning products, such as oven and drain cleaners, strong lyes that contain sodium and potassium hydroxides, and concentrated laundry detergents and cleaning agents with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phosphate</a>, sodium carbonate, and ammonia. Esophageal burns are rare with household bleaches (sodium hypochlorite) because these typically have a pH of approximately 11, which is below the pH threshold of 11.5 to 12.5 that tends to cause esophageal injury. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some caustic ingestions are caused by acid household products including toilet bowl cleaners, battery fluids, and muriatic (hydrochloric) acid used in swimming pools. Esophageal injury from acids may be attenuated compared with alkalis, and perforation of the esophagus is less common. Nonetheless, 6 to 20 percent of acid ingestions result in esophageal burns. Acids or corrosive agents tend to cause esophageal injury if the pH is less than 2. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following the initial necrosis, additional destruction takes place over the first week (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68864\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68864 \">table 1</a>). The risk for esophageal perforation peaks at this stage. (See <a href=\"#H2961375283\" class=\"local\">'Delayed injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common symptom of caustic ingestion is dysphagia, which can occur even without severe esophageal injury. Patients may also present with drooling, retrosternal or abdominal pain, hematemesis, and features suggesting upper airway injury. The presence or absence of any of the clinical features described above does not reliably predict ingestion or the presence or severity of esophageal or gastric burns. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial steps in management of caustic ingestion is supportive care and close observation, with an emphasis on preventing vomiting, choking, and aspiration. The induction of vomiting is <strong>contraindicated</strong> because vomiting may lead to additional esophageal injury if gastric contents come in contact with the esophageal mucosa. Similarly, attempts to dilute or neutralize the caustic agent, administration of activated charcoal, or gastric lavage are <strong>not</strong> recommended. (See <a href=\"#H145504937\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>against</strong> using glucocorticoids in children with caustic esophageal injuries (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A preponderance of evidence suggests that these agents do not help protect against the development of esophageal strictures and may be harmful. Additional research is needed to determine whether glucocorticoids may be beneficial for selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H145505684\" class=\"local\">'Medication'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper endoscopy should be performed for most patients with a definite history of caustic ingestion, even if asymptomatic; endoscopy should always be performed in patients with symptoms or oral lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70113\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70113 \">algorithm 1</a>). The endoscopy ideally should be performed within 24 hours of the ingestion, to evaluate and stage the esophageal injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77228 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H145504519\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy is generally unnecessary in patients with a questionable history of ingestion, no evidence of oral lesions, no dysphagia, vomiting, or other symptoms, and who remain asymptomatic and continue to swallow normally during several hours of observation. Patients who have ingested household bleaches rarely have significant tissue injury and, therefore, rarely require endoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H145504937\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with significant esophageal burns (eg, grade 2A and higher) noted on endoscopy, or those with persistent dysphagia, should be evaluated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> contrast studies two to three weeks post ingestion to assess for stricture formation. (See <a href=\"#H20530365\" class=\"local\">'Stricture formation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stricture formation is the primary complication of caustic injury. Most patients who develop strictures present with obstructive symptoms within two months. The presence of a stricture is confirmed with radiographic contrast studies. If strictures develop, esophageal dilation is performed to maintain or reestablish normal swallowing. In our practice, we generally use balloon dilators, accessing the esophagus either through the anterograde (peroral) or retrograde (via a gastrostomy) route. (See <a href=\"#H20530365\" class=\"local\">'Stricture formation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2205393662\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge George D Ferry, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Nuutinen M, Uhari M, Karvali T, Kouvalainen K.
