The result is permanent abnormal dilatation and destruction of the major bronchi and bronchiole walls.

In a study of sputum properties, neutrophil elastase when complexed with syndecan-1 is protected from inactivation by alpha-1 antitrypsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In physicochemical studies, sputum from native American children from Alaska (indigenous populations and populations from developing countries have a high prevalence of bronchiectasis) was less elastic and viscous and had higher transportability than banked sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

This hypothesis was examined in a study that assessed nasal transepithelial potential difference in patients with diffuse bronchiectasis, a normal sweat chloride, and either a normal CFTR genotype, or one or two CFTR mutations (eg, a loss of function mutation on one chromosome and a mild mutation on the other), and compared the results with those in normal subjects and patients with known cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The nasal potential difference test reflects the function of sodium and chloride channels in the airway epithelium. An abnormal nasal electrophysiologic phenotype, intermediate between normal and cystic fibrosis values, was identified in patients with diffuse bronchiectasis and one CFTR mutation, suggesting that the presence of a single CFTR mutation may play a role in the development of diffuse bronchiectasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D deficiency &#9472; A potential role of vitamin D deficiency in the vicious cycle of recurrent exacerbations of bronchiectasis was examined in an observational study of 402 patients with bronchiectasis, who were followed for three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At baseline, 50 percent were vitamin D deficient (25 hydroxy-vitamin D levels &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> and another 43 percent were insufficient (25 hydroxy-vitamin D &lt;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. The vitamin D deficient patients (compared to the insufficient and sufficient patients) were more likely to have sputum colonization with bacteria including pseudomonas, more frequent exacerbations including those needing hospitalization, worse respiratory symptoms as assessed by standard questionnaires, and increased sputum markers of neutrophil inflammation. It is not known whether this association reflects an effect of vitamin D on innate immunity or reduced outdoor physical activity due to more severe disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) &#9472; Small airway changes have been described before the advanced and destructive manifestations of bronchiectasis become apparent in patients with CVID. As an example, inspiratory and expiratory high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans were performed on 54 children ages 6 to 18 with CVID in a stable state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The most common abnormality was expiratory air trapping (mosaic attenuation), which was seen in 71 to 80 percent and was the only abnormality in 9 to 15 percent. The presence of air trapping on expiratory but not inspiratory views suggests that airway inflammatory changes are the cause and raises the possibility that these changes are reversible.

They include airway obstruction (eg, foreign body aspiration), defective host defenses, cystic fibrosis (CF), Young's syndrome, rheumatic and systemic diseases, dyskinetic cilia, pulmonary infections, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and cigarette smoking. The frequency of the different etiologies varies with the geographic location and referral population, as shown in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a North American referral center population, a comprehensive evaluation of 112 patients with bronchiectasis confirmed on chest computed tomography identified a specific etiology in 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most common etiologies were rheumatic disease (rheumatoid arthritis, Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, Crohn disease), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, immunodeficiency, hematologic malignancy, aspiration, and nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from the European Bronchiectasis Network (EMBARC) comprising seven academic medical center databases in Europe identified an underlying cause of bronchiectasis in 60 percent of 1258 patients, including postinfection (20 percent), COPD (15 percent), rheumatic disorders (10 percent), and immunodeficiency (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Testing that followed British Thoracic Society guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] identified an etiology that would potentially lead to genetic testing (eg, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) or a change in management (eg, replacement therapy for immunodeficiency, specific treatment of ABPA, prevention of aspiration, treatment of focal obstruction, or aggressive bronchial hygiene in ciliary dysfunction) in 13 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An underlying etiology is often identified in children and adolescents. In a systematic review of 989 patients with non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis, ages 21 and younger, an etiology was identified in 623 (63 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

It is important to identify the presence of airway obstruction because surgical resection is often curative.</p><p>Bronchiectasis that results from foreign body aspiration generally occurs in the right lung and in the lower lobes or the posterior segments of the upper lobes. As an example, toddlers (ages one to three years) may aspirate seeds, popcorn, or unchewed food. An episode of choking, coughing, or unexplained wheezing or hemoptysis should raise the suspicion of a foreign body. A retrospective study found that among children with greater than one month of respiratory symptoms and middle lobe or lingula abnormalities on chest radiograph, an early and aggressive strategy of chest computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy with cultures led to interventions (eg, foreign body removal, infection treatment) that produced favorable outcomes, including reduced bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In adults, particulate aspiration is typically associated with an altered state of consciousness (due to stroke, seizures, intoxication, or emergent general anesthesia). The foreign body is often unchewed food, or part of a tooth or crown. A post-obstructive pneumonia may follow the aspiration event, often resulting in incomplete resolution and predisposition to subsequent lung abscess. Delayed or ineffective therapy and poor nutrition may contribute to prolonged pneumonitis with resultant focal bronchiectasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58341 \">figure 1</a>).

While the airways appear dilated on imaging studies, the deficient cartilage support results in airways collapse during forced exhalation. Chest computed tomography (CT) with expiratory views will show proximal airway collapse and narrowing. Tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia, and tracheobronchomalacia refer to diffuse or segmental weakness of the trachea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mainstem bronchi and are discussed separately.

As a general rule, tracheomegaly is likely present when the lower trachea is wider than the vertebral column at that level. More precisely, airway diameters exceeding the following are abnormal: trachea &gt;3 cm, a right mainstem bronchus &gt;2.5 cm, and a left mainstem bronchus &gt;2 cm.

At least five of the children (10 percent) had bronchiectasis at an average age of seven years. To help determine whether a low IgG subclass represents immunodeficiency, a challenge with common humoral bacterial antigens (eg, Haemophilus influenzae vaccine or pneumococcal vaccine), followed six weeks later by measurement of antibody titers, can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

The &quot;signet-ring&quot; sign, which is a classic feature of bronchiectasis, refers to the appearance in cross-section of a dilated, air-filled bronchus that is contiguous with the smaller nodular opacity of a pulmonary artery (the jewel on the ring) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of tapering in combination with dilatation may be more specific than bronchial dilatation alone because some healthy individuals and patients with asthma may have areas of bronchial dilatation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchial wall thickening observed in dilated airways may be the best correlate and predictor of functional decline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airways affected by bronchiectasis may contain mucopurulent plugs or debris accompanied by post-obstructive air trapping.

Although tree-in-bud may acutely reflect aspiration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacterial infection, persistence of findings is suspicious for bronchiectasis distinctly associated with NTM infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cysts off the bronchial wall are a feature of more destructive bronchiectasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60935\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60935 \">image 5</a>).

The induction of bronchiectasis requires an infectious insult plus impairment of drainage, airway obstruction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a defect in host defense. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are numerous etiologies that can induce or contribute to the pathophysiologic processes that result in bronchiectasis. They include airway obstruction (eg, foreign body aspiration), defective host defenses, cystic fibrosis, rheumatic and systemic diseases, dyskinetic cilia, pulmonary infections, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and cigarette smoking.
