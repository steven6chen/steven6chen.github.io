Its psychoactive properties are primarily due to one cannabinoid: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); THC concentration is commonly used as a measure of cannabis potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The legal status of cannabis use, for medical as well as recreational purposes, varies internationally as well as across the United States. The potency of cannabis has increased significantly around the world in recent decades, which may have contributed to increased rates of cannabis-related adverse effects. Cannabis use disorder develops in approximately 10 percent of regular cannabis users, and may be associated with cognitive impairment, poor school or work performance, and psychiatric comorbidity such as mood disorders and psychosis. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of cannabis use disorder in adults are reviewed here. The epidemiology and health consequences of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder are reviewed separately. The pathogenesis, pharmacology, and treatment of cannabis use disorder in adults are also reviewed separately.

Typical manifestations of cannabis use disorder include impairment in school or work function, giving up of previously enjoyed social and recreational activities, and use of cannabis in potentially hazardous situations, eg, while driving. </p><p>The differential diagnosis from nonproblematic cannabis use relies on a careful assessment of the presenting problems or impairments, not on the absolute intensity (quantity and frequency) of cannabis use. Key features suggesting the diagnosis of cannabis use disorder include patient denial of cannabis-related problems in the face of reports from reliable collateral sources (eg, family, school, employer) and patient denial of cannabis use in the face of objective evidence to the contrary (eg, urine drug testing).</p><p>Cannabis use disorder can produce episodic or chronic mood changes or thought disturbance that may resemble non-drug-related psychiatric disorders such as persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder, delusional disorder, or schizophrenia, paranoid type. Differential diagnosis depends on the temporal relationship with regular cannabis use.</p><p>Diagnosis of cannabis use disorder under DSM-5 diagnostic criteria is reviewed below.

Several studies suggest that self-reports of cannabis and other illegal substance use can be fairly accurate, as long as there are no adverse consequences (such as criminal charges) for acknowledging use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Systematic review has identified several cannabis-use screening instruments, comprised of one to three questions, with good (though varying) sensitivity and reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Based on simplicity of use and favorable test performance characteristics, we favor the use of the single question:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;In the past year, how often have you used cannabis (or marijuana)?&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a study of emergency department patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], this question (with a cut-off of at least two times) had a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.88, 0.99) and specificity of 0.86 (95% CI 0.82, 0.89) for detecting cannabis use disorder. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2533304066\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug testing for recent cannabis use has the advantage of objectivity and, when properly administered (eg, observed sample collection), essentially 100 percent sensitivity, barring technical problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patient self-report typically has lower sensitivity than urine drug screens, especially in settings where the individual expects a negative consequence from reporting cannabis use. As examples, a study of 506 Spanish university students (ages 17 to 35 years) found that self-report had 0.92 sensitivity and 0.90 specificity for identifying recent cannabis use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A study of 3493 adult French armed forces members found that self-report had 0.86 sensitivity (95% CI 0.083, 0.88) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.93, 0.95) specificity for identifying past-month cannabis use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast, a study of 83 ethnic minority, socially disadvantaged women followed over their third trimester of pregnancy found that self-report had 0.58 sensitivity and 0.97 specificity for identifying recent cannabis use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Because drug testing is more intrusive and expensive, it is typically reserved for screening high-risk populations, for example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients seen in specialty care for a mental disorder or another substance use disorder, because of high rates of cannabis use disorder in these patients compared with the general population.

Other clinically relevant pharmacologically active cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, are detected with less sensitivity or not at all. </p><p>Urine is typically used for testing, but saliva, blood, and hair are viable alternatives. The use of urine testing in populations sacrifices specificity for sensitivity (ie, it is biased towards false positive over false negative results); thus, a positive screening result should be confirmed by a more specific test. For drug screening, this means retesting the sample with a more specific assay, eg, liquid or gas chromatography, sometimes combined with mass spectrometry.</p><p>Drug tests identify cannabis use, not cannabis use disorder. Because of the complex pharmacokinetics of THC and other cannabinoids, an individual who last used cannabis weeks ago and is functioning normally may still test positive for cannabis use, especially chronic users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Cannabinoid levels, especially in urine, are poorly correlated with impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Cannabis can be detected in the urine for as long as 30 days since last use.

We favor the use of the single question: &ldquo;In the past year, how often have you used cannabis (or marijuana)?&rdquo; (See <a href=\"#H2794931988\" class=\"local\">'Patient self-report'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug testing for THC (typically in urine) identifies cannabis use, but not necessarily its recency, and does not identify cannabis use disorder. Because THC has extensive storage in adipose tissue, there is poor correlation between THC concentrations in body fluids and cannabis-related effects.
