The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease, but elevated thyroid hormone levels may occur due to thyroiditis, multinodular goiter, toxic thyroid nodule, or excess thyroid hormone supplementation.</p><p>Common systemic features of hyperthyroidism include palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss. A number of central and peripheral nervous system manifestations may also occur in patients with hyperthyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60148 \">table 1</a>). In many cases, the neurologic manifestations occur in conjunction with the systemic features of the disease, but these may be the presenting symptom in some patients.</p><p>This topic reviews the neurologic manifestations of hyperthyroidism. Other clinical features of hyperthyroidism are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION AND SEIZURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive impairment is common in hyperthyroidism and may present as one or more different syndromes. In one review of elderly patients with hyperthyroidism, dementia and confusion was found in 33 percent and 18 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Studies in younger individuals with newly-diagnosed or induced hyperthyroidism have found lower cognitive scores compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>There is also inconclusive evidence suggesting that mild hyperthyroidism may be a risk factor for dementia. Case control and population-based cohort studies have had conflicting results, with some finding a positive association between low thyrotropin (TSH) levels and others not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Low TSH in this setting may represent subclinical hyperthyroidism, but may instead be associated with hypothyroidism if it is the result of decreased thyrotropin-releasing hormone production, itself a consequence of neurodegeneration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Alzheimer disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with thyrotoxicosis may experience behavioral and personality changes, such as psychosis, agitation, and depression. Less overt manifestations that are more common in less severe thyrotoxicosis include anxiety, restlessness, irritability, and emotional lability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Insomnia is also common. Elderly patients may have a less activated presentation with depression and lethargy, so-called apathetic thyrotoxicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These behavioral manifestations are accompanied by cognitive impairments, particularly impaired concentration, confusion, poor orientation and immediate recall, amnesia, and constructional difficulties.</p><p>Seizures may accompany the encephalopathy of acute thyrotoxicosis and occasionally are the presenting clinical feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. They may be focal or generalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Tremor and hyperreflexia with other pyramidal tract signs are also common features of the neurologic examination in thyrotoxicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Tremor'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Motor neuron disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The presentation of cognitive dysfunction in hyperthyroidism is usually subacute; however, a more protracted course similar to a degenerative dementia has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In severe thyrotoxicosis, a condition frequently referred to as thyroid storm, the neurologic presentation is more fulminant, progressing if untreated through an agitated delirium to somnolence and ultimately to coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In many of these cases there is an underlying stressor, such as sepsis, trauma, or a recent surgical procedure. Seizures are more prominent in this setting and may include status epilepticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/12,13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,18</a>]. Other clinical features of thyroid storm, such as tachycardia, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms, are commonly present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60908 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no reports of abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) neuroimaging studies. However, in one patient, single photon emission CT (SPECT) demonstrated diffusely reduced cerebral uptake with an accentuation in the temporoparietal regions bilaterally, which improved following resolution of the hyperthyroid state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Nonspecific electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities have been reported in 43 percent of patients with hyperthyroid encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. EEG may demonstrate diffuse slowing, bitemporal sharp waves, polyspike and slow wave discharges, or may be normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. In addition, an unusually high voltage with prolonged photic response and triphasic waves have been described in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in hyperthyroidism is not known. Improvement of some clinical features (attention and concentration) with beta-blocker therapy suggests a role for a hyperthyroid-induced hyperactive adrenergic system, possibly disrupting the adrenergic pathways between the locus ceruleus and frontal lobe that subserve attention and vigilance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Others propose that hyperthyroidism may produce oxidative stress, producing neuronal injury and hastening a presentation of degenerative or vascular dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The etiology of seizures in thyrotoxicosis is also not known. Animal studies have demonstrated that exogenous administration of thyroxine lowers the seizure threshold. Elevated thyroxine levels have also been associated with precipitating seizures in two patients with previously well-controlled juvenile myoclonic epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of hyperthyroidism typically leads to improvement in cognitive and behavioral impairments. Agitation, inattention, and frontal lobe impairment may improve more rapidly than other cognitive functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, cognitive dysfunction may persist despite a return to a euthyroid state.</p><p>Seizures in thyrotoxicosis are ultimately treated by thyroid lowering; however, antiseizure drugs are often used as a temporizing measure until euthyroidism is achieved. Recurrence of both generalized tonic-clonic seizures and encephalopathy coinciding with recurrence of the hyperthyroid state has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. EEG may normalize with treatment, although persistence of EEG abnormalities despite a return to a euthyroid state has also been described in isolated cases, without clear prognostic implications regarding either seizure recurrence or persistence of the encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MOVEMENT DISORDERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tremor is common in patients with thyrotoxicosis. In one small series of patients with a new diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, tremor was observed in 76 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The tremor is typically high frequency and low amplitude, primarily seen with action, and can involve the face and head as well as the extremities. It is more usual for the tremor to be incidental to other manifestations of hyperthyroidism; however, at times a disabling tremor is the presenting complaint.</p><p>The characteristics of the tremor, which resemble an exaggerated physiologic tremor, and its responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, suggest that the pathogenesis is mediated by a heightened beta-adrenergic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tremor#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tremor&quot;, section on 'Physiologic tremor'</a>.) Others have suggested a role for increased metabolism of dopamine in the etiology of hyperthyroid tremor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chorea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorea is a rare complication of hyperthyroidism, occurring in less than 2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Chorea usually occurs in the context of other features of hyperthyroidism, but it may be a presenting symptom of a thyrotoxic state. In most cases, the onset of chorea is gradual, but a sudden onset of unilateral chorea has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Chorea may be unilateral, bilateral, or multifocal and involves the extremities predominantly and less often the trunk or facial muscles. It may be continuous or occur in paroxysms that are spontaneous or precipitated by sudden movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies are normal, with no significant structural abnormality or abnormal cerebral perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Occurring in nonautoimmune thyroid disease as well as Graves' disease, chorea is believed to represent a direct effect of thyrotoxicosis on the central nervous system. Hyperthyroidism may induce a reversible functional alteration in the dopamine turnover or receptor site response to dopamine in the corpus striatum. Studies have shown a reduction in the production and turnover of the level of homovanillic acid (HVA), a metabolite of dopamine, in the cerebrospinal fluid in hyperthyroid patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This would be an expected result of an increased sensitivity of dopamine receptors and a resulting decrease in dopamine turnover.</p><p>Chorea may improve or resolve with correction of thyroid hormone levels. In some patients, this occurs rapidly; in others, it may be delayed for several weeks or more after achieving a euthyroid state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Recurrence of chorea coincident with an increase in thyroid hormone levels has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/26,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,33</a>]. Persistence of the chorea, even for decades following treatment of hyperthyroidism, has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In addition to thyroid lowering, treatment of disabling or persistent chorea consists of dopamine antagonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>. Some patients may respond to beta-blockers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chorea#H29672870\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chorea&quot;, section on 'Management of chorea'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myoclonus occurs rarely in hyperthyroidism. Isolated cases of unusual myoclonus affecting the trunk muscles or the platysma have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Ballism accompanying chorea has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">STROKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is a rare complication of hyperthyroidism. In a prospective cohort study, 3176 patients aged 18 to 44 years with hyperthyroidism were followed for five years after the initial diagnosis; the cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was 1.0 percent compared to 0.6 percent in a control group (HR = 1.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>However, except for cardiogenic embolism in the setting of hyperthyroid-induced atrial fibrillation (AF), associations of hyperthyroidism with other stroke subtypes remain speculative. A systematic review and meta-analysis found no evidence to support an increased risk for stroke associated with subclinical hyperthyroidism (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.34) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiogenic embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral infarction related to hyperthyroidism most commonly occurs as a result of a cardiogenic embolism in patients with hyperthyroid-induced AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. AF occurs in 10 to 15 percent of individuals with hyperthyroidism and can be the presenting symptom. AF is more common in men than women, and its prevalence increases with age. Subclinical as well as overt hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for AF. However, thyrotoxicosis causes a small percentage (&lt;1 percent) of AF cases.

An association between CVT and hyperthyroidism has been suggested by reports of several patients who developed CVT simultaneously with a thyrotoxic state or Graves' disease and who had no other risk factors for CVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. The number of reported cases is reported to be higher than that expected by chance alone, given the low incidence of each condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of CVT in hyperthyroidism may be related to an induced hypercoagulable state, possibly from increased Factor VIII clotting activity, documented in at least two cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43</a>]. In another patient, elevated plasma fibrinogen and decreased protein C activity may have contributed to a thrombotic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Other possible contributors include altered hemodynamics or dehydration induced by thyrotoxicosis, and venous stasis due to compressive effects of a thyroid goiter on cervical veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/39,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,44</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of CVT are discussed separately.

Pathologic examination of the carotid arteries revealed a segmental mediolytic arteriopathy, an idiopathic noninflammatory vasculopathy that predisposes to dissection and aneurysm formation in cerebral and systemic blood vessels. A small case control study found that autoimmune thyroid disease (both autoimmune thyroiditis as well as Graves' disease) was associated with spontaneous carotid dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple intracranial stenoses, similar to that seen in moyamoya disease, has been described in several patients with Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/39,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,48</a>]. Predominantly female, these patients had symptoms at a young age (mean 31 years). Clinical manifestations included transient ischemic attack and intracerebral hemorrhage.

Ptosis and orbicularis oculi weakness suggest ocular MG, while proptosis, lid retraction, lid lag, periorbital edema, and restricted eye movement with forced ductions suggest Graves' ophthalmopathy.

Thyrotoxic PP is more prevalent in Asians than in non-Asians and in males than in females. Any cause of hyperthyroidism can be associated with thyrotoxic PP.</p><p>This disorder is discussed in detail separately.

However, it is uncommon for a patient with hyperthyroidism to present with muscle weakness as the chief complaint. Patients with hyperthyroidism tend to develop muscle involvement more frequently after the age of 40. The likelihood of developing weakness, but not its degree, is correlated with the duration of the hyperthyroid state.</p><p>The pathogenesis of myopathy in thyrotoxicosis is unknown. The rapid response to thyroid-lowering treatment, at least in some patients, and a partial improvement with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> suggests that the muscle dysfunction is at least partly physiologic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/23,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,68</a>]. Contributing features may include increased cellular metabolism and energy utilization, increased catabolism and protein degradation, and inefficient energy utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/69-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-72</a>]. A significant reduction in muscle carnitine was identified in patients with hyperthyroid myopathy compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], and it is possible that this reduction contributes to myopathy.</p><p>As with the underlying thyroid disorder, the clinical presentation of myopathy may be acute or chronic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute thyrotoxic myopathy may present with more severe proximal and distal weakness, and rarely quadriplegia with bulbar and respiratory muscle involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. Rhabdomyolysis has been described in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic thyrotoxic myopathy is more common. About two-thirds of patients with hyperthyroid myopathy report proximal weakness that usually begins several weeks to several months after the onset of hyperthyroidism. Hip flexors and quadriceps are predominantly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The remainder usually has distal as well as proximal muscle involvement, although one series reported predominantly distal extremity weakness in 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The myopathy may be associated with myalgias.</p><p/><p>In both presentations, muscle atrophy is usually absent. However, several cases with atrophy of shoulder muscles have been described. Isolated dysphagia has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/74,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,80</a>]. Deep tendon reflexes are usually normal or increased, an unusual finding in a myopathic disorder, with a shortened relaxation phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/23,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,79</a>]. Paresthesias, due to coexisting polyneuropathy may be present. Cramps are less common than with hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Bulbar and respiratory muscle dysfunction occurs rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/79,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,81</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Myasthenia gravis'</a> above.)</p><p>Laboratory studies are unremarkable apart from abnormal thyroid function tests. Serum creatine kinase is generally normal, except in thyrotoxic crisis, but elevated aldolase occurs in approximately 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/23,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,79</a>].</p><p>Electromyography (EMG) may be normal but sometimes demonstrates myopathic findings of increased polyphasic, low amplitude motor unit potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/67,79,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,79,82</a>].

Spontaneous activity is atypical. Abnormal EMG has been described in hyperthyroid individuals without clinical weakness. Muscle biopsy is rarely performed, but may be normal or may show nonspecific findings. Rarely, inflammation occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>Treatment of the hyperthyroid condition is usually sufficient to treat the myopathy.

This seems only marginally increased over the prevalence in the general population of 3 to 5 percent. However, the simultaneous onset of CTS symptoms and thyrotoxicosis, and their remittance with treatment of hyperthyroidism, suggests a possible relationship.
