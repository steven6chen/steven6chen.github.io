However, it is important to remember that chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, manifested by positive tests for antithyroid antibodies, is common in the general population (occurring in 10 to 20 percent of women and 1 to 2 percent of men) and hypothyroidism (subclinical or overt) is only slightly less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, both hypothyroidism and connective tissue diseases often cause muscle and joint aches, pains, and stiffness, and common treatments for connective tissue diseases and the illnesses themselves may affect thyroid function or thyroid function tests.</p><p>Given the high frequency of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and hypothyroidism in patients with no other problems, the literature describing the occurrence of thyroid disease in patients with a connective tissue disease should be viewed with considerable caution. Most of the studies were performed in specialty clinics, so the likelihood of selection bias is high. Diagnostic criteria for thyroid disease may also vary between studies. Furthermore, there is only limited evidence that the concurrence in the same patient of thyroid disease and connective tissue disease alters the clinical manifestations or natural history of either disorder. Examples are scleroderma, in which fibrosis of the thyroid gland can occur and cause hypothyroidism independently of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, and complete congenital heart block in children of hypothyroid, anti-Ro-positive mothers.</p><p>Another part of this relationship is that the drugs used to treat connective tissue diseases and the underlying illness can affect thyroid function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug interactions with thyroid hormones&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid function in nonthyroidal illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids inhibit thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion and slightly reduce serum thyroid hormone concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> and some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs lower serum total thyroid hormone concentrations by interfering with thyroid hormone binding to its carrier proteins; serum free thyroid hormone concentrations do not change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any major illness, including connective tissue diseases, can lower serum thyroid hormone and TSH concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID DISORDERS IN CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The associations of thyroid and connective tissue diseases and data concerning the presence of antinuclear antibodies in patients with thyroid disease are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymyalgia rheumatica/giant cell arteritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The data concerning the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are conflicting. Some reports have described an increased prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], while others have questioned the association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The largest prospective study evaluated 367 patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis: hypothyroidism was found in 4.9 percent, as compared with none of 84 normal subjects and 1.6 percent of elderly normal subjects from other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the frequency of hypothyroidism in the control groups in this study was unusually low. As an example, in a smaller study of 39 patients with giant cell arteritis, biochemical thyroid dysfunction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thyroid antibodies were found in 26 percent, as compared with 31 percent of the control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and in a retrospective study, none of 77 patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis had hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, polymyalgia <span class=\"nowrap\">rheumatica/giant</span> cell arteritis may be more common in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. One series found a prevalence of 2.8 percent in 250 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, rising to 9.3 percent in women over the age of 60 years; in comparison, there were no cases of polymyalgia <span class=\"nowrap\">rheumatica/giant</span> cell arteritis among 150 control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibromyalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A blunted response of serum TSH to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has been described in a small number of patients with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The importance of this finding is unclear. It could be due to an increase in cortisol secretion, due either to the fibromyalgia itself or to the depression that often accompanies it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another small study showed an increased prevalence of antithyroid antibodies in patients with fibromyalgia compared with controls and similar to the prevalence seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Sicca symptoms seemed more frequent in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic lupus erythematosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have antithyroid antibodies (most often measured as anti-thyroid peroxidase [anti-TPO] [microsomal] antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]), a slightly higher percentage than is found in normal subjects of the same age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The antibody titers may fluctuate, and clinical thyroid disease is associated with the persistent presence of these antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In terms of thyroid disease, the following observations have been noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of overt thyroid disease appears to be between 3 and 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/10,12-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-19</a>], with subclinical or overt hypothyroidism being more common than hyperthyroidism in most studies. As an example, in a study of 153 SLE patients screened for thyroid disease, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of hypothyroidism (19 percent), hyperthyroidism (9 percent), and thyroid antibodies (33 percent) in comparison with controls (2 percent, 1 percent, and 13 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one study, thyroid dysfunction was not associated with the duration of SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another study, older age, smoking, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody positivity were associated with autoimmune hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated low triiodothyronine (T3) has been observed in 4 to 8 percent of patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the study of 153 SLE patients, papillary thyroid cancer was found in five of the SLE patients compared with one of the 459 controls, with a relative risk (RR) of 14.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The presence of thyroid cancer did not appear to be related to the treatment of SLE, but thyroid autoimmunity may be a predisposing condition for thyroid cancer in this group of patients. An uncontrolled ultrasound study of 55 lupus patients found a prevalence of thyroid nodules in 27 percent. This finding was associated with prior <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> treatment. None were malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 3286 Caucasian people with Graves' disease (2791 cases) or Hashimoto's thyroiditis (495 cases), there was a significantly increased RR of SLE in both diseases, with the RR in women being over 10-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There was also an increased risk of SLE noted in the men with Graves' disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Part of the association between SLE and thyroid disease may be due to genetic factors. In a study of 378 multiplex SLE families, 35 also had autoimmune thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A genetic linkage effect in the region of D5S1462 on the chromosome 5q14.3-15 was demonstrated between these two related autoimmune conditions. In a study of families with more than one member affected by SLE, family members with SLE and secondary Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome had a higher prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease than SLE family members without secondary Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (30 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased risk of preterm delivery and other pregnancy complications has been noted in pregnant women with SLE and thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In a retrospective study of 63 pregnant women with SLE, 37.9 percent of the cohort had thyroid disease diagnosed before, during, or immediately after pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Preterm delivery occurred in 67 percent of the women who had thyroid disease, compared with 18 percent of the women with SLE who remained free of thyroid disease. Thyroid antibodies did not predict preterm delivery in this group of women, but in another study, the presence of connective tissue disease and thyroid autoantibodies was independently associated with increased risks of pregnancy complications (miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, preterm delivery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H2608516097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Preterm birth'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the prevalence of thyroid disease in patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome vary widely, ranging from 10 to 70 percent. Some of the variance may be accounted for by different criteria for thyroid disease (eg, abnormalities in thyroid structure, hormonal function, or presence of autoantibodies). Observations of a higher prevalence of thyroid disease in this population may also represent confounding factors as demographic features that favor Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome also increase the risk of thyroid disease (eg, female sex and advancing age). However, a study of 114 patients with primary Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome showed 14 percent to have hypothyroidism, while thyrotoxicosis had occurred in 1.8 percent of the same cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease&quot;</a>). Autoimmune disease, including autoimmune thyroid disease, has been shown to cluster in first-degree relatives of patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, symptoms of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome may occur with increased frequency in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. As an example, 32 percent of 19 patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis had keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prospective study of 91 patients with rheumatoid arthritis found that 30 percent had some evidence of clinical or subclinical thyroid disease, as compared with 11 percent of patients with osteoarthritis or fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In one study from Norway, the frequency of antithyroid antibodies was increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In contrast, a study from the United States showed a similar prevalence of antithyroid antibodies in 1290 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 1236 controls (15.6 versus 15.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a large, population-based study of 1998 cases and 2252 controls, T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) replacement was associated with a twofold risk of both anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)-positive and negative rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis, the risk associated with the combination of T4 substitution and the shared epitope alleles HLA-DRB1 was higher than that associated with either alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Psoriatic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antithyroid antibodies and subclinical hypothyroidism were found more frequently in women with psoriatic arthritis than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Men with psoriatic arthritis had an increased prevalence of antithyroid antibodies alone. Subclinical hypothyroidism occurred in 25 percent of women with psoriatic arthritis, compared with 8 percent of controls and 12 percent of women with rheumatoid arthritis, and appeared to be associated with polyarticular involvement and longer disease duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1041641596\"><span class=\"h2\">Ankylosing spondylitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study of 80 patients with ankylosing spondylitis found 10 percent had Hashimoto's thyroiditis, defined as positive thyroid autoantibodies plus at least one of the following features (diffuse goiter, abnormal thyroid function tests, parenchymal heterogeneity on ultrasound), compared with 1.3 percent of healthy controls. As only one ankylosing spondylitis patient had subclinical hypothyroidism, with the rest being euthyroid, the clinical significance is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed connective tissue disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data on the frequency of thyroid disease in mixed connective tissue disease.

A larger study of 159 patients found a similar prevalence of antithyroid antibodies, present in 21 percent of patients, all of whom required T4 treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Scleroderma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothyroidism occurs more frequently in women with scleroderma than in control populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. As mentioned above, fibrosis of the thyroid gland can directly cause hypothyroidism in patients with scleroderma and appears to be responsible for most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of 202 patients with scleroderma compared with population-based controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Clinical (4 versus 0.3 percent) and subclinical (17 versus 6 percent) hypothyroidism was more common in female scleroderma subjects than controls. Anti-TPO antibodies were not significantly different between hypothyroid and non-hypothyroid scleroderma subjects.</p><p>However, in a prospective study of 179 patients with scleroderma, baseline TSH was higher and anti-TPO antibodies were more likely to be present in scleroderma patients than controls, as was a small thyroid volume and hypoechoic pattern on ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. After a mean follow-up of 73 months, new thyroid dysfunction (defined as clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism) occurred in 23 of 179 patients compared with 7 of 179 in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Subclinical hypothyroidism (14 versus 3 new cases) and positive TPO antibodies (11 versus 3 new cases) were significantly more likely to develop in scleroderma patients than controls.</p><p>In a study of 138 patients with scleroderma, anti-TPO antibodies were increased in patients with limited scleroderma, whereas the levels of these antibodies in patients with diffuse scleroderma were similar to those in healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These findings support the hypothesis that hypothyroidism in limited scleroderma may reflect thyroid autoimmunity, while fibrosis may be the mechanism of hypothyroidism in diffuse scleroderma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antinuclear antibodies in patients with thyroid disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antinuclear antibodies have been detected in the serum of patients with both Graves' disease and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis in some, but not all, studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. In the most comprehensive study including 22 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism and 28 with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, 13 (26 percent) had antinuclear antibodies and 17 (34 percent) had anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies (the percentages were approximately the same in each patient group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-disorders-and-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].
