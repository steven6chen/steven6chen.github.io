Varied use of common terminology may cause some confusion when reading the literature. Some suggest that &quot;amaurosis fugax&quot; implies a vascular cause for the visual loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but the term continues to be used when describing visual loss from any origin and involving one or both eyes. The term &quot;transient monocular blindness&quot; is also often used but is not ideal, since most patients do not experience complete loss of vision with the episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &quot;Transient monocular visual loss&quot; (TMVL) and &quot;transient binocular visual loss&quot; (TBVL) are preferred to describe abrupt and temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes, since they carry no connotation regarding etiology.</p><p>Transient visual loss, either monocular or binocular, reflects a heterogeneous group of disorders, some relatively benign and others with grave neurologic or ophthalmologic implications. The task of the clinician is to use the history and examination to localize the problem to a region in the visual pathways, identify potential etiologies, and, when indicated, perform a focused battery of laboratory tests to confirm or exclude certain causes. Therapeutic interventions and prognostic implications are specific to the underlying cause.</p><p>This topic discusses transient visual loss. Other ocular and cerebral ischemic syndromes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central and branch retinal artery occlusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TRANSIENT VISUAL LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, patients with transient visual loss almost always present after the episode has resolved; hence, the neurologic and ophthalmologic examination is usually normal. Reliance is placed on the patient's description of the nature of the visual symptoms and associated features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64994 \">table 1</a>). Pertinent medical and family history may also provide valuable clues to the underlying diagnosis.</p><p>Few case series of patients with transient visual loss are reported. Details from the Framingham cohort provide some interesting insights into the challenges of evaluating this symptom. Between 1971 and 1989, participants were systematically questioned regarding specific symptoms of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke; 186 of 2110 subjects reported onset of a sudden visual deficit (not necessarily transient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Follow-up evaluation determined the underlying cause to be stroke or TIA (24 percent), ocular disease (17 percent), transient monocular blindness (10 percent), and migraine (14 percent). The cause remained unknown in 22 percent, and a miscellany of etiologies comprised the remaining 12 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Historical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important historical features include whether the visual loss affected one or both eyes, the duration of the episode, and a specific description of the symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Monocular versus binocular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important, but often difficult, to establish whether the visual loss was monocular or binocular. Transient monocular visual loss (TMVL) implies a disorder anterior to the optic chiasm (ie, the eye or the optic nerve); possibilities include ocular disease as well as ischemia due to ipsilateral carotid artery disease. Transient binocular visual loss (TBVL) suggests a more posterior process, involving the optic chiasm, tracts, or radiations, or the visual cortex.</p><p>Patients with homonymous visual field defects often report monocular visual loss and attribute it to the eye with the temporal field cut. The patient should be asked specifically whether each eye was alternately covered during the attack. Impairment of reading suggests that the visual loss was binocular rather than monocular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In practice, many patients are not able to state definitively whether the episode affected one or both eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When the history is unclear, the clinician should assume that either a monocular or binocular etiology is possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient visual obscurations due to papilledema typically last seconds. Thromboembolic events from carotid disease or elsewhere generally last 1 to 15 minutes and only rarely an hour or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Migraine aura typically lasts 10 to 30 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Description of visual symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient visual loss (TVL) from any cause can be described as mild blurring or fogging to complete blackness, and may involve a part of or all of the visual field. As an example, patients with ocular ischemia may lose the upper or lower half of vision, the temporal or nasal aspect of vision, small areas of vision centrally or paracentrally, and the entire visual field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. TMVL descending over the field of vision (like a curtain or shade) or, less commonly, ascending from below, is highly suggestive of retinal ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>].</p><p>Positive visual phenomena, such as photopsias or scintillations that march across the visual field, suggest migraine as the most likely diagnosis. Seizures affecting visual cortex often involve positive visual symptoms, but are typically maximal at onset and lack the evolution or build-up characteristic of migraine. While the visual symptoms produced by retinal ischemia are usually &quot;negative&quot; (eg, shaded, black, blurred), positive symptoms are also known to occur in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/6,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,12</a>]. Similarly, migraine can produce visual loss without scintillations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Patients who experience intermittent hyphema (hemorrhage within the anterior chamber) may remark that the visual field appears red (erythropsia) during the episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Precipitating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe carotid occlusive disease has been associated with dimming of vision in one eye after exposure to bright light (retinal claudication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/6,12,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,16-18</a>]. Alternating transient visual loss to bright light has also been described in two patients with giant cell arteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Other retinal diseases (eg, photoreceptor dystrophy, macular degeneration) are also associated with transient worsening of vision in bright light. The mechanism is believed to be related to an ischemia-induced delay in regenerating visual pigments in the photoreceptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Episodes of TMVL due to carotid stenosis may be induced by changes in posture or neck position that temporarily reduce blood flow through the artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Postprandial TMVL has been described in severe carotid narrowing, presumably as a vascular steal phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>].</p><p>TMVL occurring when the eye is moved into certain positions of gaze (gaze-evoked amaurosis) is suggestive of an orbital mass and is thought to be due to interruption of blood flow to the retina, choroid, or optic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Loss of vision after exercise or a hot shower (Uhthoff's symptom) is characteristic of demyelinating disease of the optic nerve. Exercise has also been reported to induce retinal vasospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The transient visual obscurations of papilledema are sometimes brought on by postural change, exercise, or muscular straining.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with TVL from vasospasm, migraine, or ischemia may have multiple episodes separated by minutes or years. In one study, a high number of recurrent episodes (&gt;10) of TMVL was more likely to be associated with complete rather than incomplete or absent occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, multiple, stereotypic episodes of TMVL recurring over many years in the absence of stroke or permanent visual loss would suggest a more benign etiology such as migraine or vasospasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TVL due to thromboembolic disease is painless in the vast majority of patients. The association of TVL with headache or periocular pain should alert the examiner to check for other causes such as migraine, angle closure glaucoma, and giant cell arteritis.</p><p>The association of TVL with transient contralateral hemiplegia is strongly suggestive of severe carotid occlusive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>]. Vertebrobasilar symptoms (vertigo, dysarthria, diplopia) should suggest posterior circulation ischemia. Visual loss in the latter setting is binocular, but patients may misreport a transient hemianopia as monocular vision loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older age, a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia all suggest atherosclerotic vascular disease. Known cardiac disease might indicate a cardioembolic event. A history of rash and previous miscarriage is a feature of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which may uncommonly cause TVL. A family history of stroke at a young age or unexplained thrombosis might prompt evaluation for an underlying hereditary hypercoagulable disorder. A history of typical migraine headaches in the patient or family member suggests migraine as a cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination should include testing of visual acuity and visual fields, and examination of the optic fundus. The techniques employed are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;, section on 'Vision (CN II)'</a>.)</p><p>Fundoscopic examination should include careful observation of the optic disc, retina, and blood vessels for clues as to the origin of the visual symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disc swelling in the setting of TMVL suggests an acute event involving the optic nerve, usually ischemia or inflammation. Because optic disc pallor does not develop until four to six weeks after an injury, its presence suggests a subacute or chronic process, rather than an acute event. Bilateral disc swelling with good visual acuity should prompt an evaluation for papilledema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-differential-diagnosis-of-papilledema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and differential diagnosis of papilledema&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retinal whitening often reflects ischemia of the inner retina, and may be seen after a branch or central retinal artery occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60171\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60171 \">picture 1</a>). Mid-peripheral hemorrhages, tortuous veins, and neovascularization reflect reduced retinal arterial flow and venous stasis as the result of severe carotid stenosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-and-branch-retinal-artery-occlusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central and branch retinal artery occlusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the arterioles should focus on caliber as well as the presence of embolic plaques. Investigators have attempted to identify the origin of retinal plaques by their appearance, but in practice the distinction is often difficult. A Hollenhorst plaque typically appears at vascular bifurcations, and has a highly refractile appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63740\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63740 \">picture 2</a>). It strongly suggests ipsilateral carotid artery disease, but these cholesterol emboli may also arise from a more proximal source, such as the aortic arch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Platelet-fibrin and calcific emboli are less commonly seen.</p><p/><p>A detailed eye examination usually requires an ophthalmology consult, which is indicated in many cases of TVL (see <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation of transient visual loss'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF TRANSIENT MONOCULAR VISUAL LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemia is the most common cause of transient monocular visual loss (TMVL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; this in itself can have diverse etiologies. Papilledema, optic neuropathy, and ocular disease are other causes of TMVL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemia</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1777682226\"><span class=\"h3\">Common features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis and pathophysiology for TMVL of ischemic origin are diverse, and include large artery occlusive disease (atherothrombosis, embolus, dissection), small artery occlusive disease (anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, vasculitis), venous disease, cardiac disease, hypercoagulable disorders, and systemic hypoperfusion. The final common pathway for these disorders is ischemia to the retina, the optic nerve, or both. TMVL secondary to retinal ischemia from carotid disease may be due to either embolism or hypoperfusion from fixed arterial stenosis, whereas optic nerve ischemia usually results from the latter mechanism.</p><p>Most patients with TMVL attributable to ischemia will report areas of blank or fuzzy vision (&quot;negative visual phenomena&quot;). Less common, but not unusual, are reports of positive visual phenomena. Symptoms generally begin abruptly and reach maximum severity within the first few minutes.</p><p>Funduscopic examination may be normal or may show evidence of vascular disease: cotton wool spots, retinal emboli, retinal hemorrhages, retinal whitening, or dilated retinal veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60171\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60171 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63740\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63740 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Retinal embolism is frequently asymptomatic. In a population-based study of approximately 2000 older adults (&ge;49 years) whose retinas were examined at five and ten years, there was a baseline prevalence of retinal emboli of 1.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The cumulative 10-year incidence was 3 percent. Over 10 years follow-up, all-cause and stroke-related mortality was somewhat higher in patients with documented retinal emboli (HR = 1.3; CI 1.0 to 1.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Carotid artery disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic visual loss related to occlusive disease in the cervical carotid artery may result from thromboembolism or hypoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. The former mechanism is believed to be more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/13,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,27</a>].</p><p>In contrast to transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) involving the cerebral hemispheres, retinal ischemia is more commonly associated with emboli originating from carotid stenosis rather than heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/5,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28-30</a>]. This may represent a streaming effect of laminar blood flow, whereby particulates of uniform size are consistently deposited into one lamina, and swept into the same distal vascular bed. Small emboli from carotid disease may be more likely to drift to the edge of the bloodstream and enter the ophthalmic artery. Also, these small particles may be more prone to obstruct the smaller retinal arterioles.</p><p>Severe stenosis (90 to 100 percent) of the ipsilateral carotid artery may also cause visual loss due to retinal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> choroidal hypoperfusion from flow limiting stenosis. This ischemic mechanism may be more likely to include positive visual phenomena and recurrent episodes than thromboembolism, and it is often induced by activities that reduce ocular perfusion pressure (such as postural change, postprandial vascular steal) or increase retinal oxygen demand (such as exposure to bright light) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/6,9,12,18,20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,12,18,20,27</a>]. In contrast, episodes of TMVL due to carotid artery thromboembolism usually occur spontaneously, and are more often isolated events, although they can recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Visual loss caused by either mechanism typically encompasses the entire visual field, but may affect only the upper, lower, nasal, or temporal portion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/2,8,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9,11</a>]. Small central or paracentral scotomas can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The classic description of a &quot;curtain&quot; or &quot;shade&quot; descending over vision, is relatively uncommon; in one large study, only 23.8 percent of patients with TMVL experienced altitudinal visual loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nonetheless, when this is described, it is highly suggestive of retinal embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Patients may also experience gradual graying of vision that progresses from the periphery to the center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/11,12,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,32</a>]. The visual loss may be associated with scintillations or the sensation of color [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Episodes generally last from seconds to minutes, rarely more than 15 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/2,6,8,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,8,9,11</a>].</p><p>When contralateral hemispheric symptoms (motor, sensory, aphasia) accompany visual loss, carotid disease is very likely; however, TMVL is more often an isolated symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p>In a prospective study of 337 patients with TMVL, clinical features most predictive of high-grade (&gt;70 percent) carotid stenosis included rapid onset of symptoms, altitudinal pattern of onset or resolution, and a duration of 1 to 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of carotid disease in the setting of TMVL is important because of the implications for stroke risk, approximately 2 to 3 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Most of these strokes are large-vessel infarcts within the territory of the ipsilateral carotid artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Compared with cerebral ischemia, TMVL carries a lower risk for stroke in the setting of high-grade carotid disease; but still identifies a high-risk population for which carotid endarterectomy may be beneficial, particularly in high-risk subgroups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>].

Occlusion or near occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries by granulomatous inflammation within the artery wall can cause an anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

The visual loss and hallucinations could start in a specific part of the visual field, could move or be stationary, or could involve the entire visual field. These symptoms were not specifically localizing; underlying lesions (present in all) were found in either the occipital or temporal lobes. Ictal blindness may be an isolated epileptic phenomenon, but is more usually accompanied by other manifestations, such as tonic eye deviation, altered consciousness, or motor impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

As with Todd's paralysis (postictal weakness following a motor seizure), the mechanism is presumed to be prolonged enhancement of inhibitory stimuli in response to prolonged excitation (similar in some ways to migraine).</p><p>Adult onset visual seizures may be associated with cortical lesions in the posterior visual pathways, which produce a corresponding visual field defect.

If only one hemisphere is ischemic, the patient will experience homonymous visual field loss contralateral to the lesion. Visual loss may be an isolated symptom or may be accompanied by symptoms of brainstem ischemia (dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, diplopia) or cerebral ischemia (hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, aphasia). Isolated visual symptoms are usually the result of occipital lobe ischemia secondary to posterior cerebral artery occlusion. Difficulty seeing to one side is the most common symptom; lateralized flashing lights (photopsias) are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].</p><p>As with anterior circulation ischemia, the mechanism of strokes in the posterior circulation may involve thrombosis, embolism, or hypoperfusion from fixed arterial stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carotid imaging</strong> &ndash; Carotid duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, or computed tomographic angiography should be ordered in all older patients (&gt;50 years) and in younger patients with vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) who have experienced TMVL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed in a patient of any age with TMVL who has a history suggestive of carotid artery dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Further evaluation and treatment of carotid disease in the setting of TMVL is discussed elsewhere.

This is also indicated in patients with TBVL due to posterior circulation ischemia. Testing may include Holter monitoring and echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The details of this evaluation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;, section on 'Cardiac evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) should also be included in the evaluation of these patients as cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with TMVL and central retinal artery occlusion is significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/17,30,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30,93</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brain MRI</strong> &ndash; Older patients with binocular visual symptoms (TBVL) that accompany symptoms suggestive of vertebrobasilar ischemia, should have a brain MRI. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) increases the yield of abnormalities in patients with TIA, and intracranial and cervical magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may turn up occlusive disease of the posterior circulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with retinal artery occlusion also frequently have ischemic changes on DWI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Selected patients with TMVL whose mechanism remains uncertain mechanism following above studies, may benefit from having a brain MRI with DWI, as the presence of ischemic lesions may indicate a more vigorous assessment for less common causes of ischemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients whose history or examination suggests optic neuropathy should have an MRI to look for other evidence of demyelinating disease. A history suggestive of compressive optic neuropathy (gaze evoked amaurosis) or seizure should also prompt a brain MRI with contrast enhancement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>EEG</strong> &ndash; Electroencephalography (EEG) is not a routine test for TVL, but should be undertaken in a patient with TBVL whose symptoms suggest possible seizure. EEG monitoring may increase the diagnostic yield, especially in patients with frequently recurring symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypercoagulable testing</strong> &ndash; When brain or ocular ischemia is the suspected cause of TVL, hypercoagulable testing should be performed in individuals who have suggestive histories (prior thrombosis, miscarriage, or family history), as well as in individuals with probable ischemia and otherwise negative workup. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-adult-patients-with-established-venous-thromboembolism-for-acquired-and-inherited-risk-factors#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating adult patients with established venous thromboembolism for acquired and inherited risk factors&quot;, section on 'Hypercoagulable tests'</a>.) A complete blood count should also be obtained to screen for conditions such as polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.</p><p/><p>In young patients without vascular risk factors, evaluation can be more selective. Patients in whom there is a strong presumptive diagnosis of migraine may have a somewhat limited workup or perhaps no testing at all. An example might be a young person with typical binocular visual symptoms that include positive phenomena and are followed by migraine headache. Other factors that support (but obviously do not confirm) a diagnosis of migraine include a family history of migraine and a past history of migraine headaches. The more the symptoms deviate from classic migraine, the more extensive the workup should be.</p><p>In the majority of young patients (&lt;50 years) with TMVL who are otherwise healthy, the diagnostic yield of extensive testing is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/4,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,95</a>]. The most reasonable presumed cause is vasospasm or migraine, although this remains speculative. Their future risk of stroke is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. However, TMVL due to carotid disease and cardiac disease does occur in young people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/3,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,93</a>]. The extent to which these patients should be subjected to diagnostic investigation is debated, and should be decided individually. A conservative approach recommends performing noninvasive studies that identify high-risk pathology. This might include MRI, carotid imaging, ECG, echocardiography, and selective clotting studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss/abstract/1,3,70,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,70,93</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Underlying causes of transient visual loss range from benign conditions to those with serious neurologic and ophthalmologic sequelae.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With transient symptoms, the diagnosis is guided by historical features. The most important of these is the distinction between monocular and binocular involvement; however, this is often unclear. Other helpful features include symptom duration, description of symptom onset, the presence of positive visual phenomena, precipitating factors, and associated symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64994 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Historical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia originating from carotid artery disease is a common cause of transient monocular visual loss (TMVL), and has serious implications for future stroke risk that can be reduced by carotid endarterectomy. Suggestive features include rapid onset in an altitudinal pattern (visual loss descending over the field of vision like a curtain or shade) and brief duration (&lt;10 minutes). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Carotid artery disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giant cell arteritis is not a common cause of TMVL but is a treatable cause of otherwise permanent visual loss. It is clinically indistinguishable from TMVL of carotid disease except for frequent accompanying headache. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Giant cell arteritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes of TMVL include ischemia from cardioembolic disease, some ocular conditions, and others. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Causes of transient monocular visual loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMVL in young patients may be due to retinal vasospasm or may be idiopathic, but other etiologies must be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Retinal vasospasm and retinal migraine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine typically produces binocular symptoms with positive phenomenology and a characteristic build-up, lasting 10 to 30 minutes, and associated with or followed by migraine headache. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Migraine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Binocular visual loss, usually isolated to one visual field, can also occur during vertebrobasilar ischemia or seizure. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Causes of transient binocular visual loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some diagnostic testing is required in most patients; an exception is a young patient with normal examination, typical migrainous features, and no vascular risk factors. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein should be performed in all individuals over age 50 years with transient monocular or binocular visual loss. We recommend ophthalmologic examination and carotid duplex ultrasound for all patients with TMVL. Other tests are ordered according to symptoms and clinical setting and may include cardiac workup, hypercoagulable testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78246 \">table 2</a>).
