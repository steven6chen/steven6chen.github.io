Scaphoid fractures account for 10 percent of all hand fractures and 60 to 70 percent of all carpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>A study of scaphoid fractures in the military showed an unadjusted incidence of 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">21/1000</span> person-years. In addition, males and whites had a higher relative risk, and 20 to 24 year olds had the highest incidence at 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">64/1000</span> person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. According to data from the United States National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, the estimated incidence in the population at large is 1.47 <span class=\"nowrap\">fractures/100,000</span> person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy and biomechanics of the wrist are discussed in detail separately; anatomy of particular relevance to scaphoid injury is reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-basic-biomechanics-of-the-wrist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The scaphoid is the largest bone of the proximal carpal row and is located on the radial aspect of the hand just distal to the radius itself (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70211\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70211 \">image 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56302\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56302 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69097 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51990\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51990 \">figure 4</a>). In lateral profile, the scaphoid is shaped like an hourglass. The scaphoid articulates with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and lunate. The radioscaphoid and scapholunate ligaments anchor the scaphoid proximally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63301 \">figure 5</a>). The radial collateral ligament attaches to its lateral surface.</p><p>The palmar carpal branch of the radial artery supplies the scaphoid via the bone's distal pole and then proceeds to the proximal pole. Thus, blood supply to the proximal pole is tenuous and can be interrupted by a fracture (particularly at the waist or proximal end), thereby increasing the risk of nonunion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50525\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50525 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>The most common classification of scaphoid fractures categorizes them by location: distal third (distal pole), central third (waist), and proximal third (proximal pole) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51297\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51297 \">figure 7</a>). Approximately 65 percent of scaphoid fractures occur at the waist, 15 percent at the proximal pole, 10 percent at the distal body, and 8 percent at the tuberosity (a protuberance at the distal palmar aspect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the scaphoid can occur either with direct axial compression or with hyperextension of the wrist, such as with a fall onto an outstretched hand. When the wrist is loaded in this manner and is dorsiflexed greater than 95 degrees, the indentation (waist) in the midbody of the scaphoid is forced against the dorsal lip of the distal radius, creating a mechanism for injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, the patient with a scaphoid fracture reports sustaining an injury involving an axial load placed on the wrist or a fall onto an outstretched hand. Pain is localized to the radial aspect of the wrist, often in the area just proximal to the thumb metacarpal. Swelling may or may not be noticeable but if present, is usually on the dorsoradial aspect of the wrist.</p><p>Range of motion may be only slightly reduced unless there is a concomitant fracture dislocation. Grip strength is typically reduced.</p><p>Focal tenderness is usually present in one of three places:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The volar prominence at the distal wrist crease for distal pole fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100554\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100554 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86694\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86694 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anatomic snuff box (see below) for waist fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82858 \">picture 3</a>), which are most common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Just distal to Lister's Tubercle (a longitudinal bony prominence of the distal radius located just to the ulnar side of the extensor carpi radialis tendon) for proximal pole fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86693\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86693 \">picture 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The anatomic snuffbox is located proximal to the base of the thumb between the extensor pollicis longus tendon medially and extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus tendons laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82858 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97472 \">figure 8</a>). A good method for evaluating the body of the scaphoid is to gently bring the patient's wrist into ulnar deviation and slight volar flexion, and then palpate the anatomic snuffbox (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82859\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82859 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p>Scaphoid fractures are often occult and a high index of suspicion should be maintained for any patient with wrist pain following trauma. Any tenderness in the snuffbox should be treated as a scaphoid fracture until proven otherwise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3514524\" class=\"local\">'Immobilization (casting) and general management'</a> below.)</p><p>A systematic review of 75 studies pertaining to the diagnosis of scaphoid fracture provides some insights into the most useful aspects of the history and physical examination, although the authors noted the low quality of most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The history was not found to be useful for diagnosis. In contrast, the absence of scaphoid tenderness and of pain with resisted supination of the forearm were both associated with a statistically significant reduction in the likelihood of a scaphoid fracture, with negative likelihood ratios of 0.15 and 0.09, respectively. Physical findings not associated with a statistically significant increase in the probability of fracture included snuffbox pain with axial thumb compression, ultrasound-generated vibratory pain, pain with radial or ulnar deviation, or pain with resisted supination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For suspected scaphoid fractures, standard plain radiographs include posteroanterior (PA), true lateral, oblique and scaphoid views of the wrist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70211%7ERHEUM%2F78664%7EEM%2F58484\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70211 graphicRef78664 graphicRef58484 \">image 1A-C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83486\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83486 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83488\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83488 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83487\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83487 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75655\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75655 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74559\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74559 \">image 6</a>). The scaphoid view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58484\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58484 \">image 1C</a>) is a PA picture taken with the wrist in full pronation and ulnar deviation. This view shows the scaphoid in its longitudinal axis without superimposed shadows from the distal radius.</p><p>Within two to six weeks of the injury, plain radiographs are limited in their capacity to detect scaphoid fractures. The false negative rate is approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Oblique fractures of the middle portion of the scaphoid body may be particularly difficult to detect on plain radiographs and if missed, can lead to poor outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In addition, observational studies suggest that plain radiographs do not reliably show fracture detail, such as displacement. As an example, a study in which two hand surgeons, two musculoskeletal radiologists, and two senior orthopedic residents assessed plain radiographs of scaphoid fractures created in cadavers reported a sensitivity of 78 percent for identifying fracture displacement of 1 mm at the scaphoid waist and an accuracy of 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A blinded observational study of 30 scaphoid fractures in which six experienced clinicians were asked to determine whether displacement was present reported a sensitivity of 75 percent and an accuracy of 68 percent for plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>If fracture alignment is unclear on plain radiographs, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100561\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100561 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F100562\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100562 \">image 8</a>), with images taken along the long axis, can correctly identify the degree of displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Knowledge of normal carpal anatomy is essential for determining the presence of a fracture or dislocation, especially when interpreting the lateral view. In lateral radiographs, the distal radius, lunate, and capitate should align along a longitudinal axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78664\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78664 \">image 1B</a>). In addition, the scapholunate angle should fall between 40 and 60 degrees. This angle is formed by a line bisecting the scaphoid in its longitudinal axis and another line bisecting the lunate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76002\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76002 \">image 9</a>). Larger or smaller angles indicate ligamentous instability or a fracture.</p><p>Plain radiographs should be evaluated for signs of ligament disruption, specifically of the scapholunate ligament. These signs include a widened space (&gt;3 mm) between the scaphoid and the lunate (the &quot;Terry Thomas&quot; sign). Widening can be accentuated by taking a PA view with the hand closed in a fist and the wrist in ulnar deviation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52517\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52517 \">image 10</a>). Undetected scapholunate ligament injuries can lead to disruption of the proximal carpal row and a condition known as scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) or scapholunate advanced collapse wrist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75552\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75552 \">image 11</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain#H5769574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Scapholunate instability'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF SUSPECTED ACUTE FRACTURE WITH NEGATIVE PLAIN RADIOGRAPHS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3514601\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to imaging and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When plain radiographs are normal but patient history and examination findings are suspicious for scaphoid fracture, evidence supports obtaining advanced imaging acutely&mdash;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) immediately, or radionuclide bone scan at least 72 hours after injury. We favor MRI due to its greater sensitivity and specificity, and its usefulness for detecting associated soft tissue injuries. However, CT or bone scan are good options, and may be preferred based on local availability and expertise, cost, and other factors.</p><p>The prevalence of occult scaphoid fracture in patients with trauma-related wrist pain but negative plain radiographs is approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The management of these patients often consists of immobilization in a thumb spica splint or cast for 7 to 14 days followed by reimaging with plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. This traditional approach is reasonable but results in delayed diagnosis, and approximately 80 percent of patients will be immobilized unnecessarily for a week or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/12,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17,18</a>]. </p><p>Early use of advanced imaging (ie, CT or MRI immediately after injury, or radionuclide bone scan at least 72 hours after injury) provides more rapid and accurate diagnosis, and can markedly reduce unnecessary immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/10,12,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,19,20</a>].</p><p>Several studies support acute MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/17,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21-25</a>], CT, or bone scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>] as more cost-effective strategies than empiric immobilization when initial plain radiographs are normal. While up-front imaging costs are higher using this approach, these are offset by lower costs for immobilization, follow-up visits, missed fractures and resulting nonunions, and loss of productivity. </p><p>There is no consensus on which imaging modality is the gold standard. The authors of a systematic review concluded that two such standards are reasonable: positive plain radiographs at six or more weeks post-injury, or agreement of at least two advanced imaging modalities (MRI, CT, or bone scan) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Using these criteria, their review of 11 studies of moderately high quality, involving 717 patients with 719 suspected scaphoid fractures, reported the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone scan has the statistically highest diagnostic accuracy due to its high sensitivity (99 percent; 95% CI 69-100), but it may not be the best test because its low specificity (86 percent; 95% CI 73-94) results on average in overtreatment of 112 of 1000 patients with negative plain radiographs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI and CT have statistically comparable diagnostic accuracy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI has a sensitivity of 88 percent (95% CI 64-97) and specificity of 100 percent (95% CI 38-100), and misses approximately 24 fractures in 1000 patients with negative plain radiographs, but results in no overtreatments. MRI also identifies soft tissue injuries in surrounding structures, and timing after injury does not affect its accuracy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F100562\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100562 \">image 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT has a sensitivity of 72 percent (95% CI 36-92) and specificity of 99 percent (95% CI 71-100) and would miss approximately 56 fractures in 1000 patients and overtreat only 8 patients. Timing after injury does not affect its accuracy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100561\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100561 \">image 7</a>).</p><p/><p>The preferred approach to diagnostic imaging following negative plain radiographs depends upon a number of factors including the need for a rapid diagnosis, cost, resource availability, patient preference, and local expertise. Financial assessment should consider not only the cost of the imaging study but also the costs entailed in lost work days and repeat office visits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383175642\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive (88 percent in one review) and highly specific (100 percent in the same review) for diagnosing scaphoid fractures, and may be used when standard radiographs are inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/10,12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,20</a>]. Overall, MRI is more accurate than bone scan and as accurate as CT for diagnosing a scaphoid fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. MRI also accurately identifies bony and soft tissue injuries in surrounding structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F100562\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100562 \">image 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3514601\" class=\"local\">'Approach to imaging and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>When a fracture is present, the MRI shows diminished signal in T1-weighted images and increased signal in T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Findings interpreted as &quot;edema&quot; can occur with fractures, microtrabecular fractures (bone bruise), or ligamentous injuries.</p><p>Several studies have reported that a protocol for evaluating suspected carpal fractures using MRI would be more cost effective than the traditional approach of immobilization followed by repeat plain radiographs and would provide an earlier definitive diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/17,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3514608\"><span class=\"h2\">Radionuclide bone scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the presence of a scaphoid fracture, a radionuclide bone scan (ie, bone scintigraphy) shows focal increased uptake after 72 hours. Thus, the study must be performed at least 72 hours after injury. A negative bone scan virtually excludes a scaphoid fracture, with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.12 according to one systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, bone scan can detect other bony injuries in cases of suspected scaphoid fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3514601\" class=\"local\">'Approach to imaging and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Nevertheless, bone scan has limitations. It is less specific for a scaphoid fracture than either MRI or CT, and may be positive due to other injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/7,12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,20</a>]. Bone scan also entails highest radiation dose of any of the techniques used to diagnose scaphoid fracture, and therefore may not be appropriate in children.</p><p>The authors of one systematic review of bone scintigraphy for suspected scaphoid fracture provide a diagnostic algorithm in which a bone scan is performed after three to seven days has elapsed since the initial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. According to multiple observational studies, scanning in this time frame detects all fractures and minimizes costs from additional follow-up (radiographs, office visit charges, and further diagnostic testing) and time lost from work. However, bone scintigraphy may result in unnecessary immobilization due to false positive results, and its cost is not inconsequential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3514460\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) can be used to diagnose scaphoid fractures and delineate details of the fracture pattern. As noted in the systematic review described above, CT is highly specific for detecting scaphoid fractures but less sensitive than MRI or bone scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If MRI is not available, CT can be used to rule in a scaphoid fracture but cannot definitively rule out such injury. Timing after injury does not affect its accuracy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100561\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100561 \">image 7</a>).

Abnormalities consistent with fracture include cortical disruption and displacement of the radial artery from the radial cortex of the scaphoid. Sonography is not as well studied as alternative imaging methods. A meta-analysis of six studies reported the sensitivity to be 80 percent (albeit with a relatively wide confidence interval: 95% CI 67-90) and specificity to be 87 percent (95% CI 81-91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75498019\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of scaphoid fracture is made by radiograph. However, radiographic signs of fracture may be delayed or subtle, and clinicians should assume the injury is present in patients with a consistent mechanism of injury and examination findings. A definitive diagnosis can then be made using more advanced techniques (eg, MRI) or repeat plain radiographs obtained 7 to 10 days following the injury.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>Given the risk of nonunion and the close monitoring required during treatment, it is reasonable to obtain surgical consultation for any scaphoid fracture, even acute nondisplaced injuries. Most randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/2,31,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31,33-36</a>] and three meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>] have found no significant differences in long-term function or radiologic healing between patients with nondisplaced waist fractures treated surgically or conservatively. Therefore, routine surgical treatment of waist fractures is not routinely indicated. However, more rapid return to work or sport&mdash;about six weeks sooner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]&mdash;can be achieved with surgical fixation of waist fractures. This may be especially important in persons who require earlier return to sport or occupation (athletes, military, laborers) or those who cannot tolerate prolonged casting. Workers or athletes treated surgically are usually able to return to work in four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Delayed presentation is a risk factor for nonunion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/13,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,41-43</a>]. Therefore, we suggest obtaining consultation with a hand surgeon for any patient presenting more than approximately three weeks after injury. According to the authors of a series of 285 scaphoid fractures, nonunion rates can reach 40 percent when diagnosis and treatment are delayed by four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Thus, proper evaluation and close follow-up are crucial. Nevertheless, a review of 88 scaphoid fracture nonunions noted that initial radiographs were not obtained in 14 percent of patients who sought immediate medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Evidence of nonunion necessitates referral to an orthopedic surgeon. Arterial flow to the scaphoid enters via the distal pole and travels to the proximal pole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50525\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50525 \">figure 6</a>). This blood supply is tenuous, increasing the risk of nonunion, particularly with fractures at the waist and proximal end (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100563\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100563 \">image 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Nonunion may occur in as many as 5 to 10 percent of all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Risk factors for nonunion include fracture displacement, delayed care, and proximal pole location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Concerns about the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications on fracture healing are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Possible effect on fracture healing'</a>.)</p><p>Ice may be applied acutely to reduce swelling and pain, but if a splint is applied, the patient should be warned not to get it wet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1510267\"><span class=\"h2\">Casting recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Displaced scaphoid fractures are referred for surgical management. Our suggested approach to the casting of nondisplaced fractures suitable for nonoperative management is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal scaphoid fractures and possible occult fractures are immobilized in a short-arm thumb spica cast with the wrist in slight extension for four to six weeks. Immobilization of the thumb may not be necessary when casting distal fractures, but pending further study, we prefer this conservative approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midbody (waist) or proximal (but <strong>not</strong> proximal pole) scaphoid fractures that are to be managed nonoperatively are immobilized initially in either a long-arm or a short-arm cast depending upon clinician and patient goals and values. Immobilization includes the thumb. If a long-arm cast is chosen, it may be changed to a short-arm cast after six weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Initial treatment with a long-arm cast reflects a greater emphasis on ensuring fracture union and less emphasis on preventing elbow joint stiffness and muscle atrophy; treatment with a short-arm cast reflects a greater emphasis on avoiding such complications and accepts a possible increase in the risk of nonunion, although the evidence for this is weak.</p><p/><p>Although the results of two randomized trials suggest that immobilization of the thumb may not be required when casting nondisplaced scaphoid fractures involving the midbody or distal pole, methodological problems limit this evidence. In one multicenter, randomized controlled trial of casting for 55 nondisplaced and minimally displaced scaphoid waist fractures, higher rates of fracture union at 10 weeks (determined by CT) were found in those treated without thumb immobilization, and functional and pain outcomes and radiographic union rates at six months were the same regardless of whether the thumb was immobilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Another randomized trial of 392 patients with an acute nondisplaced scaphoid fracture found that the incidence of union at six months was no different among patients treated with casts that immobilized the thumb and those that did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, this trial was limited by several factors, including an unequal distribution of proximal pole fractures, high drop-out rate, and limited follow-up period (six months).</p><p>Traditionally, long-arm casts have been used to immobilize scaphoid fractures treated nonoperatively in order to minimize movement at the fracture site, which increases the risk of nonunion. However, evidence about the effectiveness of this approach is limited. According to a systematic review of four randomized trials with methodologic limitations involving 523 patients, no statistically or clinically significant benefit was found for any particular approach to immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Two included trials compared immobilization in a long-arm cast and a short-arm cast for acute scaphoid fractures and the pooled results showed no significant difference in nonunion rates (four nonunions in 76 patients for short-arm versus six nonunions in 75 patients for long-arm). A second systematic review also identified two trials that compared long-arm and short-arm casting, with one trial from 1964 not included in the review described above. Pooled results showed no difference in union rate, time to union, or complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As shown here, evidence to help determine ideal cast length is limited and some authors recommend initially treating midbody and proximal fractures with a long-arm cast for the first four to six weeks, followed by a short-arm cast for the remainder of treatment, which is a reasonable approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Although the large majority of studies of nonoperative treatment of scaphoid fractures have significant methodologic limitations, outcomes for distal and midbody fractures do not appear to differ according to the type or position of the cast, with the exception of wrist extension, which did appear to reduce the risk for mobility restrictions following cast removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The duration of immobilization depends upon the location of the fracture, with distal fractures requiring the shortest period and proximal fractures the longest, which is due to the distal-to-proximal blood supply of the scaphoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50525\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50525 \">figure 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nondisplaced fractures are followed serially with radiographs obtained every two weeks. Guidelines for the duration of immobilization of scaphoid fractures are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal pole &ndash; 4 to 6 weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waist (midbody) &ndash; 10 to 12 weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal (but <strong>not</strong> proximal pole) &ndash; 12 to 20 weeks</p><p/><p>However, these guidelines are approximations, and immobilization should be continued until fracture union is documented on radiographs. CT can be used if healing is not well visualized on plain radiographs.</p><p>Ninety to 98 percent union rates have been achieved with appropriate cast immobilization of nondisplaced distal and midbody scaphoid fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/16,45,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,45,47</a>]. Exercises to maintain finger, elbow, and shoulder range of motion should be performed while the wrist is immobilized.</p><p>If at three to four months radiographic healing is not evident, referral to a hand surgeon should be obtained for possible treatment with a bone stimulator or surgical correction with bone grafting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nondisplaced fractures treated with a short-arm cast can be allowed to return to full activity, including non-contact sports, if the cast does not interfere with activity or sport-specific functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scaphoid-fractures/abstract/1,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,45</a>]. The clinician should carefully monitor the integrity of the cast and ensure proper immobilization. After the cast is removed, the wrist should continue to be protected for two months with rigid splinting, while the patient participates in non-contact sports or other strenuous activity.</p><p>Physical or occupational therapy is strongly encouraged because of the weakness and decreased range of motion that typically results from prolonged casting. As mentioned above, during activity the wrist should continue to be protected for at least two months, until strength is at least 80 percent of the uninjured side and the range of motion has returned to near-normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs should be obtained immediately after the injury, but these may not reveal evidence of a fracture. Management of patients with negative initial radiographs but concern for scaphoid fracture based on clinical findings consists of advanced imaging if an immediate diagnosis is needed (MRI is most accurate and our preferred approach) or immobilization and repeat imaging with a bone scan (after three to five days) or plain radiographs (after 7 to 10 days). Check radiographs carefully for concomitant injury of the scapholunate ligament.
