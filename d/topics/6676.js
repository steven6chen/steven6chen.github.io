Nevertheless, as the differential diagnosis for foot pain is broad and exposure to foot-related problems is often limited during medical training, many clinicians may not be adequately prepared to assess the patient with foot complaints. </p><p>This topic reviews the common causes of <strong>fore</strong>foot pain in the adult, including descriptions of important conditions and a discussion of how to reach a diagnosis. An overview of foot pain generally, including more detailed discussions of foot anatomy and biomechanics, and how to conduct a history and examination of the patient with foot complaints, is provided separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of foot pain in adults&quot;</a>). A topic devoted to running injuries, including foot-related problems, is also available.

Problems with toes and toenails affect between 60 and 75 percent of older individuals. Common problems include bunions (hallux valgus), hammertoes, and bunionettes, and a majority of adults have corns or calluses located on their toes or plantar foot surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Forefoot pain causes disabling symptoms in up to 36 percent of individuals older than 70. Women are more commonly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Certain activities and occupations place significant stress on the feet. In a study of female professional Flamenco dancers, 80.7 percent had metatarsal pain while dancing and 84.1 percent demonstrated plantar hyperkeratosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ballet and some forms of martial arts also expose the forefoot to greater risk of injury. Intense training and marching by soldiers and police officers is associated with stress fractures of the forefoot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The surface on which activities are performed may predispose to forefoot pain. As an example, some forms of artificial turf are associated with higher great toe injury rates among both soccer and American football players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>A number of medical conditions can affect the forefoot, with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), gout, and osteoarthritis (OA) being among the most common. Approximately 90 percent of patients with active RA have forefoot involvement, and foot pain is the leading cause of incapacity in this patient population with the forefoot being the primary location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. RA patients develop a variety of conditions, including bunions, synovitis, metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint dislocations, claw toes, and calluses. </p><p>Gout has an estimated prevalence of 3 percent, with 80 percent of cases affecting the lower extremity. The first MTP joint is the most common location for a flare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p>OA of the forefoot occurs primarily at the first MTP joint. Few high-quality studies exist and the literature reports a wide range (6.3 to 39 percent) for first MTP joint arthritis in middle age and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A survey of 5109 adults over age 50 reported that 7.8 percent had first MTP OA, with a higher incidence among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, 75 percent of those with radiographically documented OA found their pain disabling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1233735879\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important elements of the history and examination in patients complaining of foot pain are reviewed separately. Aspects of particular relevance to forefoot pain are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults#H13378206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of foot pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults#H13378212\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of foot pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Anatomy-based approach to diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Several elements of the history may suggest a cause of forefoot pain. As an example, patients with bunions, bunionettes, hallux rigidus (HR), or turf toe often complain of pain while wearing particular shoes that is relieved when alternative shoes are worn. Patients with bunions or bunionettes often feel much less pain when wearing sandals or open toe shoes, while patients with turf toe or HR experience less pain when wearing a shoe that is stiffer in the forefoot, providing more support.</p><p>&quot;It feels like I have a stone in my shoe&quot; or a sensation like stepping on a wadded up sock causing pain around the ball of the foot are common complaints from patients with metatarsal pain. Pain when walking barefoot is another common symptom in patients with metatarsalgia. Morton neuroma often causes pain in the same region as metatarsalgia, but the pain is less like stepping on a stone and more of burning or sharp sensation that radiates toward the toes.</p><p>The first and most important part of the forefoot examination is visual inspection. Key findings include valgus deviation of the great toe, varus deviation and rotation of the fifth (little) toe, splaying between any of the toes, and hammer toes, interphalangeal joint (IPJ) flexion contractures or &quot;curly toes.&quot; Inspection may also reveal the presence of calluses on the dorsum of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints or particularly over the plantar metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints. </p><p>In most cases, the examiner can detect flattening of the transverse, or metatarsal, arch while the patient stands. Weight-bearing increases the flattening. Another sign of flattening is that the plantar surface of the arch appears flat or convex across the metatarsal heads, rather than concave. Signs of acute injury include redness, swelling, or obvious deformity of a metatarsal or phalanx.</p><p>Following inspection, important structures to palpate in the patient with forefoot pain include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First MTP joint (great toe)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifth MTP joint</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plantar surface of MTP joints and just proximal at the diaphyseal shaft</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermetatarsal spaces</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metatarsal shafts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plantar calluses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dorsal proximal interphalangeal calluses</p><p/><p>The examiner should assess the range of motion of the first MTP joint, as well as ability to flex and extend the other toes. On the plantar surface, palpable prominence of metatarsal heads may indicate that the metatarsal head has subluxed through the plate. Pain caused by squeezing the metatarsals together (Tinel sign) suggests neuroma. Tenderness from pressure or percussion over a particular metatarsal shaft suggests a stress fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4252448988\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH TO FOREFOOT PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author's approach to forefoot pain begins with the history. The first question is whether the pain is associated with acute trauma. The majority of problems seen in the primary care setting arise from <strong>non</strong>-traumatic causes that include congenital, structural, and medical conditions. For such atraumatic conditions, evaluation begins with careful inspection of the forefoot. Three general questions guide this inspection, as the clinician attempts to narrow the differential diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are the findings localized to a particular structure or region?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there generalized changes to all or multiple metatarsophalangeal (MTP) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there forefoot pain without obvious changes in the appearance of the foot?</p><p/><p>The answers to these questions enable the clinician to determine which category of forefoot problems most likely includes the correct diagnosis. These categories and additional questions to clarify the diagnosis are described in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114060 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Acute trauma isolated to the forefoot most often involves any of five areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Great toe or the first MTP joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sesamoid bones under the first MTP joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail beds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesser toes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metatarsals</p><p/><p>Five clinical questions guide the examiner to the diagnosis of the most likely injury, as outlined in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114061 \">table 2</a>). Standard plain radiographs are often obtained as part of the assessment of the acutely traumatized forefoot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114594\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114594 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>The common conditions causing forefoot pain that are mentioned in the diagnostic tables are described in greater detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1463623820\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CAUSES OF FOREFOOT PAIN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3059964133\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic forefoot conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of the more common causes of chronic forefoot pain are described here. A diagnostic approach to the patient with forefoot pain is provided above, along with tables summarizing the key clinical questions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114060 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114061 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3951949442\"><span class=\"h3\">Bunions (hallux valgus)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valgus malformation of the great toe, commonly known as a bunion, is a common and potentially painful and debilitating condition of unclear etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52955 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F64417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64417 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F76005\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76005 \">image 2</a>). Bunions are the most common problem affecting the forefoot. They can occur in children and young adults but increase in frequency with age. Clinical diagnosis of bunions is primarily based upon a history of great toe pain and increasing valgus deformity. Visual examination of the foot confirms the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96788\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96788 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96789 \">picture 2</a>). Patients with bunions have altered foot pressure patterns that can lead to the development of other abnormalities, including a depressed foot arch and greater foot pronation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Radiology studies offer limited value to the primary care clinician but may be useful for surgeons to determine the best approach to surgical correction. Bunions are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hallux-valgus-deformity-bunion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hallux valgus deformity (bunion)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3942165419\"><span class=\"h3\">Hallux rigidus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hallux rigidus (HR)<strong> </strong>describes a first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint that shows unusual stiffness resulting in limited great toe extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98856\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98856 \">picture 3</a>). The term &quot;hallux rigidus&quot; is typically used only when the cause of the reduced range of motion (ROM) is osteoarthritis (OA) of the first MTP. &quot;Hallux limitus&quot; refers to a great toe that lacks normal motion but does not demonstrate degenerative changes at the MTP joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102220\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102220 \">picture 4</a>). </p><p>Hallux limitus can arise from inflammation, thickening of the joint capsule, or from an idiopathic cause possibly representing a complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The most common location of OA of the foot is the first MTP joint. As over 6 percent of middle age and older adults have OA, it is likely that a significant percentage of HR stems from joint limitation due to OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>For normal walking, approximately 65 degrees of extension of the first MTP joint is ideal. In HR, normal extension is usually reduced by 50 percent or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One study of great toe extension found that standing active dorsiflexion of the great toe closely approximates the degree of dorsiflexion that occurs during a normal walking gait: Mean MTP dorsiflexion when standing was 44 degrees compared with 42 degrees of extension when walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While diagnostic criteria vary, most experts consider first MTP extension of less than 30 degrees as abnormal.</p><p>Patients with HR complain of great toe pain, stiffness, or an uncomfortable bump on the top of their first MTP. While the majority of individuals have significant pain, some patients may have advanced HR without pain and the problem only becomes apparent when a change in gait is recognized or during evaluation for another condition, such as plantar fasciitis. Redness may be present around the first MTP joint, and examination often reveals squaring or enlargement of the joint. Palpation may reveal bone spurs, local warmth, or focal tenderness. Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of the first MTP joint shows loss of joint space, bone spurring, and sometimes calcifications. Ultrasound reveals degenerative change at the MTP and can demonstrate joint effusions with hypoechoic change or associated injuries to the extensor tendon.</p><p>Apart from OA of the first MTP joint, evidence pertaining to other potential causes, anatomical variations, and the biomechanics underlying HR is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A family history of HR suggests greater risk, particularly for those with bilateral involvement. Unilateral HR is associated with trauma and female gender. Hallux valgus, metatarsus adductus, and a flattened MTP joint are more common in individuals who develop HR.</p><p>Primary care clinicians can begin treatment with over-the-counter or custom orthotics and should advise patients to use shoes with adequate room in the toe box. The author likes to add a first ray post to the orthotic to assist with the toe-off phase of walking or running gait. Orthotics are the primary intervention used for most patients treated conservatively. Some patients, particularly those with obvious swelling of the first MTP joint, gain significant pain relief from glucocorticoid injection. The treatment for HR related to OA and for painful OA follows the same strategy of reducing pressure on the first MTP joint with orthotic inserts and medications to relieve pain.</p><p>Since HR causes narrowing of the MTP joint space, the author prefers using ultrasound to guide any injection. Approach the joint using a dorsal approach just to either side of the extensor tendon. For blind injection, clinicians may find that longitudinal traction opens the joint space slightly and may allow easier entry into the joint space.</p><p>Large retrospective reviews suggest that conservative treatment of hallux limitus may be effective. In a retrospective series of 772 patients, 428 responded to nonoperative treatments defined as the ability to return to most activities with acceptable levels of pain; 296 patients ultimately chose to have surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. While some studies tracked patients for a number of years, most long-term studies followed individuals treated surgically. For this reason, the efficacy of specific non-operative treatments remains unknown. Uncontrolled studies suggest that surgery with cheilectomy or arthrodesis provides long-term relief of pain and improved function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alternatives such as joint replacement show good short-term results, but long-term follow-up studies are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1795636496\"><span class=\"h3\">Metatarsalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metatarsalgia is the term commonly used to describe pain at the plantar surface of the distal diaphysis of the second and third metatarsals.<strong> </strong>Typically, pain arises<strong> </strong>from partial or complete collapse of the transverse arch formed by the metatarsal heads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97769\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97769 \">figure 3</a>). Metatarsalgia can develop from poor gait biomechanics, abnormal foot anatomy, or congenital abnormalities affecting the foot or ankle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. While changes like bunions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96788\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96788 \">picture 1</a>) and bunionettes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96801\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96801 \">picture 5</a>) in the first and fifth rays are often associated with metatarsalgia, the condition also occurs in otherwise normal feet.</p><p>The key structural abnormality that develops in metatarsalgia is loss of the support provided by the transmetatarsal ligaments and capsule, which suspend the distal shaft of the metatarsals at the diaphysis. If too much pressure is placed on these ligaments, they can break down over time and allow the first ray to deviate (ie, splay) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96819\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96819 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96821\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96821 \">picture 7</a>). If the capsule breaks down on the plantar surface, a metatarsal head may sublux toward the plantar surface of the foot. In extreme cases, this leads to a hammer toe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98852\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98852 \">picture 8</a>) from entrapment of the metatarsal head and flexor tendon.</p><p>Patients with metatarsalgia complain of sharp pain on the plantar surface of the foot in the area of the distal metatarsals. The pain is often described as feeling like they are stepping on a stone. The second and third metatarsal heads are the most common location of the pain. The pain is relieved by sitting or sometimes when wearing shoes that offer forefoot support. Barefoot walking increases the discomfort. Dorsal pain occurs more often with a stress fracture and is not typical of metatarsalgia. Burning or neuropathic pain points toward neuroma or neuritis. Along with stress fracture and Morton neuroma, the differential diagnosis in adolescents includes Freiberg disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-limp-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of limp in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Older patients are at greater risk of developing metatarsalgia, and women are affected more often than men. Athletes in sports like distance running whose forefeet repetitively sustain large impact forces are at increased risk. Pressure on the forefoot may be increased in athletes who frequently wear shoes with spikes (eg, baseball or track cleats) or provide only limited support (so-called &quot;minimalist shoes&quot;) or have an excessive heel to forefoot drop.</p><p>The most common anatomic abnormality associated with metatarsalgia is a short first metatarsal or a long second metatarsal. However, extreme pes planus or pes cavus changes of the arch are often associated with metatarsal pain even when metatarsal length remains normal. Individuals with failed bunion or HR surgery may displace pressure from the first MTP plantar surface to the central metatarsals, thereby developing an acquired form of metatarsalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Clinical findings of metatarsalgia include flattening of the transverse arch or splaying of the toes that is seen when the patient stands, and loss of the metatarsal arch on the plantar surface that is seen when the patient sits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96830\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96830 \">picture 9</a>). Abnormal plantar calluses can develop over any of the metatarsal heads, most often over the second, often referred to as Morton callus. Palpation elicits pain at the distal plantar diaphysis just proximal to the metatarsal head. Neither standard radiographs nor ultrasound helps to confirm the diagnosis of metatarsalgia. Imaging is reserved for cases where a metatarsal stress fracture is suspected, or standard therapy is ineffective, raising the possibility of rare causes of foot pain such as a metastatic tumor or bone cyst.</p><p>The initial treatment for metatarsalgia consists of metatarsal pads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96824\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96824 \">picture 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96825 \">table 3</a>). A small observational study comparing walking shoes, sandals, and a customized sandal with a built-in metatarsal pad reported that walking time without pain doubled and distance increased two to three times in the customized sandal compared with the other shoe wear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Small uncontrolled prospective studies suggest that correct placement of these pads (such that distal plantar pressure is reduced) correlates strongly with pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Metatarsal pads are particularly important for older patients, in whom forefoot pain is associated with decreased physical activity and increased risk of falling. If metatarsal pads are ineffective, small observational studies suggest that customized orthotics designed to unload the distal metatarsals and distribute plantar pressure more evenly substantially reduce pain and allow patients to increase their walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Surgical referral is a last resort for metatarsalgia. The classic surgical procedure of metatarsal osteotomy tends to fail over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Newer reconstruction techniques offer promise for patients with unrelenting pain, but long-term outcome studies are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H308762690\"><span class=\"h3\">Morton neuroma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interdigital neuromas of the foot are often referred to as Morton neuroma. The etiology of Morton neuroma is not fully understood but is thought to be similar to metatarsalgia, involving collapse of the transverse arch that places traction and increased pressure on the interdigital nerve, ultimately leading to injury. Overpronation and tight shoes are often associated with the condition. Morton neuroma is a common problem in athletic and non-athletic populations.</p><p>The patient with a neuroma most commonly complains of a burning pain in the third intermetatarsal space (between the third and fourth distal metatarsals) that may radiate towards the toes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65666\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65666 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, the condition may also develop in the second or fourth interspaces. An intermetatarsal bursitis can cause a similar pain. Some patients may complain of numbness of the involved toes or pain that increases with activity. Examination may reveal a clicking sensation (Mulder's sign) when palpating the involved interspace while simultaneously squeezing the metatarsal joints. Direct palpation may reveal tenderness. Some clinicians apply pressure to a quarter or similar-sized coin while rolling it between the metatarsals to see if this elicits focal pain.</p><p>Ultrasound offers an inexpensive option for identifying Morton neuroma with accuracy comparable to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and can help to distinguish a neuroma from intermetatarsal bursal swelling or synovitis in<em> </em>adjacent joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Characteristic lesions over 5 mm in diameter are considered clinically important. The use of MRI to diagnose Morton neuroma is problematic because features consistent with neuroma may appear in as many as one-third of asymptomatic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Conservative treatment should precede expensive diagnostic procedures. This approach involves decreasing pressure on the metatarsal heads by using a metatarsal support or bar or padded shoe insert. Several studies have measured the loading pressures placed on metatarsals before and after the use of metatarsal pads, bars, orthotics, and specialized orthopedic shoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/20,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,28-32</a>]. In all reports, pain relief correlated with reduction in pressure. Proper placement of the inserts just proximal to the metatarsal head is important. Strength exercises for the intrinsic foot muscles are often part of conservative treatment. No randomized controlled studies have been performed to assess these interventions.</p><p>Treatment inserts are often placed in both shoes, even when symptoms are unilateral, to ensure that the patient walks evenly, but bilateral pads are not always needed. Symptomatic relief often begins within a few days of insert use and pain may completely subside over several weeks.</p><p>A broad-toed shoe that allows spreading of the metatarsal heads may be helpful. Proper shoe width should be determined while standing, using a professional shoe fitting device. If width has changed, older shoes should be discarded.</p><p>If conservative measures fail to relieve symptoms, a single injection of a glucocorticoid and local anesthetic into the site of tenderness can be performed using a dorsal, <strong>not</strong> plantar, approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. A plantar approach is more likely to cause complications. A number of combinations have been used. We prefer to inject <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> 0.5 mL (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> solution) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 0.5 mL (1 percent solution). In addition, we limit the total volume of the injection to 1 mL to minimize discomfort and reduce the risk of fat pad atrophy, although up to 2 mL total volume may be used. Some study authors have used a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (20 mg, or 0.5 mL) and 1 percent lidocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound-guided injection is preferred by many practitioners to ensure accurate needle placement, although studies are limited, and injection guided by anatomic landmarks can be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The majority of patients experience some benefit from glucocorticoid injection. Relief can last three months or longer with ultrasound-guided injection according to one randomized trial and multiple case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/35,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37-39</a>]. In addition, the use of a glucocorticoid appears to give somewhat better relief than injection of a local anesthetic alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Complications are rare; metatarsal fat pad atrophy can be debilitating but may occur less often if a dorsal injection is used and injection is guided by ultrasound.</p><p>Other treatments, including injection of alcohol and radiofrequency therapy to ablate the neuroma, have shown promise in observational case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. These should be considered research treatments until further study clarifies their efficacy.</p><p>Surgical removal of the neuroma and nerve may be necessary in patients who remain symptomatic <strong>after</strong> 9 to 12 months of nonoperative therapy. Surgical success rates of up to 80 to 90 percent have been reported in some uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/33,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,43-45</a>]. However, others report much lower success rates and emphasize potential complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. If surgery is performed, a dorsal approach appears to allow earlier weightbearing and return to work, and causes less painful scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. No randomized trials of surgery for plantar neuroma have been reported. Rarely, a neuroma may recur following surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129371404\"><span class=\"h3\">Bunionette (tailor&rsquo;s bunion)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bunionettes are painful bony prominences that occur over the lateral aspect of the fifth (little toe) MTP joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96801\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96801 \">picture 5</a>). In most cases, there is a prominence of the metatarsal head and a varus angle or subluxation of the fifth MTP joint. A widened fourth to fifth intermetatarsal angle suggests either genetic or structural alteration. Injury to the fourth to fifth intermetatarsal ligament from altered gait involving either excessive compensatory supination during toe-off or a supinated foot strike may cause increased separation between the fourth and fifth rays and result in breakdown of the MTP joint capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102231\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102231 \">picture 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Most bunionettes are readily detected by visual inspection of the foot and rarely cause significant symptoms. When symptoms do occur they typically include pain directly over the fifth MTP joint or over the lateral aspect of the fifth MTP with pressure from the shoe. Examination may reveal abnormal callusing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98916 \">picture 12</a>) and sometimes mild MTP joint swelling. Radiographs have no routine role except in those patients considering surgery.</p><p>For those who have mild to moderate symptoms, shoes with a wider toe box or an orthotic that incorporates a lateral fifth ray post often relieves the pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96826\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96826 \">picture 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96827\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96827 \">picture 14</a>). Patients with an extremely supinated gait or foot strike may require a more extensive orthotic correction. Surgery may be necessary in athletes who cannot compete or patients whose ability to walk is compromised due to severe pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Distal osteotomies and other procedures can help to relieve pain and restore foot function, and recurrence rates appear to be low, although controlled studies are lacking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4008612814\"><span class=\"h3\">Hammertoes, claw toes, and lesser toe deformities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These deformities are relatively common and arise from soft tissue injury, inflammatory arthritis, neuromuscular disorders, or trauma, although genetic predisposition may play a role (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102225\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102225 \">picture 15</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In the Framingham foot study involving 2446 patients with an average age of 66 years, lesser toe deformities occurred in 29.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism underlying hammertoe deformities is complex. Collapse of the transverse arch is associated with breakdown of the trans-metatarsal ligaments and the plantar plate beneath the metatarsals. If the metatarsal heads &quot;drop&quot; and become entrapped in a defect in the plantar plate, the toe becomes trapped in flexion. This causes some hyperextension of the first phalanx on the MTP joint and may cause flexion at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, depending on the pattern of tissue injury. The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint usually remains neutral. Pain may be felt at the plantar surface over the MTP joint. Often when the flexion contracture is significant the dorsum of the PIP joint is pushed against the shoe and calluses form over the joint. These are commonly referred to as traumatic &quot;knuckle pads&quot; and may become painful or cause skin ulceration.</p><p>Other less common toe deformities include &quot;curly toes,&quot; mallet toes, crossover toes, and claw toes. These arise from a variety of soft tissue trauma, often related to underlying medical or neurologic conditions. Most of these deformities are treated only when they create significant symptoms. When hammertoes or lesser toe deformities cause significant pain or interfere with gait, surgical correction is required. For less severe symptomatic cases, hammer toe pads, buddy taping, shoes with a roomy toe box, and various orthotic straps and forefoot padding may offer some pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Claw toes merit mention as a possible indication of neurologic injury. In claw toe there is dorsiflexion of the proximal phalanx on the MTP joint and plantar flexion of the PIP and DIP joints. This differs from curly toes that have flexion of the MTP, PIP, and DIP joints. Mallet toes show a flexion contracture of the DIP joint only. Claw toes are relatively common in patients after the seventh decade of life, with women developing them more frequently. While older patients do not have a secondary cause in most cases, younger patients often do and it is important to consider such causes as lumbar radiculopathy, diabetic neuropathy, inflammatory arthropathy, or a neuromuscular condition in these patients.</p><p>Hammer toes and claw toes have particular importance in diabetic patients, among whom prevalence ranges from 32 to 46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. These deformities are associated with greater plantar forefoot pressure. Prospective studies suggest that hammer toes and claw toes increase the risk for developing foot ulcers in diabetic patients. However, the mechanism for these injuries is complex, and intrinsic muscle imbalance and weakness alone do not predict which diabetics develop hammer or claw toes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H429320167\"><span class=\"h3\">Brachymetatarsia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachymetatarsia refers to abnormally shortened metatarsals. Among active adults, first and fourth brachymetatarsia are most common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98850\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98850 \">picture 16</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98851 \">picture 17</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98849 \">picture 18</a>). Other variants are due to rare genetic conditions or intrauterine trauma. First metatarsal insufficiency is a common term that suggests the degree of shortening of the first metatarsal alters the normal function of the first ray. A short first metatarsal, with or without associated hypermobility, destabilizes the foot's axis of balance and allows excessive pronation. This places additional stress on the central metatarsals. Morton foot (named for the anatomist Dudley Morton) consists of a triad of findings, including a congenitally short first metatarsal, a hypermobile first metatarsal segment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96830\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96830 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96789 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98878\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98878 \">picture 19</a>), and calluses under the second and third metatarsals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98857\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98857 \">picture 20</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p>The author suggests that first brachymetatarsia is likely to be clinically significant when the condition appears extreme on visual inspection or when the patient's gait shows excessive forefoot pronation or lack of push-off from the great toe. Palpation of the first and second metatarsal can give the clinician a sense of whether the first metatarsal is much shorter than the second; standard foot radiographs are used to confirm the discrepancy. The abnormal motion created by first brachymetatarsia may destabilize the first MTP joint leading to HR, bunion formation, and chronic forefoot pain. In addition, the additional load placed on the lateral metatarsals often leads to a more generalized break down of the entire forefoot causing callus formation and pain from metatarsal injury. Pain is often reduced and function improved with a custom orthotic.</p><p>Fourth brachymetatarsia is easily recognizable by appearance. The shortened fourth metatarsal allows the fourth phalanx to displace dorsally so that it often overlaps the dorsum of the fifth phalanx. This conditions leads to an excessively thin forefoot and less stability with pronation and supination during normal gait. Orthotics can help to provide stability. If the dorsally displaced fourth phalanx is painful or does not fit into shoes, some patients opt for amputation of the phalanx. Lengthening procedures have been performed for all types of brachymetatarsia, particularly in younger patients. While such procedures may improve appearance, many patients have complications including MTP stiffness and rotation of the affected ray [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Patients may have an isolated long second ray without shortening of the first metatarsal but this condition tends to place less stress and cause less severe problems in the forefoot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F96831\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96831 \">picture 21</a>). In this condition, symptoms most often develop at the proximal or distal interphalangeal joint of the long second toe from pressure at the end of the shoe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2185156193\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calluses, corns, and plantar warts are common causes of forefoot discomfort.

As the metatarsal head subluxes and breaks through the metatarsal plate, pressure form the bone on the plantar surface creates friction and callusing. In patients with neuropathy involving the feet, this callus often breaks down to form an ulcer. Corns differ from calluses in having a hyperkeratotic core (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56092\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56092 \">picture 23</a>).

Other injuries that may be sustained from such trauma include toe dislocations, turf toe, and subungual hematoma. Great toe fractures and open or intra-articular fractures involving other toes all can cause long-term problems with foot function and gait and therefore require careful management. A history of trauma accompanied by a swollen tender toe, with or without rotation or malalignment, warrants radiographic assessment. Plain radiographs generally confirm the diagnosis.

Depending upon the severity of injury, there is some degree of swelling, discoloration, and tenderness around the first MTP joint. Passive flexion and extension of the great toe is painful. Passive sliding of the joint can be performed to assess the stability of the plantar ligament complex. </p><p>Grade 1 injuries represent a sprain of the plantar capsular ligament complex that is painful but not disabling. With taping and rigid first ray support in the shoe many athletes continue to compete. Grade 2 injuries represent a partial rupture of the plantar capsular ligament complex that requires most athletes to rest for approximately two weeks before returning to sports using protection similar to that for a Grade 1 injury. Grade 3 injuries are significant tears of the plantar MTP structures such that recovery is prolonged, often requiring three to four months; more severe injuries (approximately 2 percent) may require surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Grade 3 injuries are generally associated with severe swelling and ecchymosis, weakness of great toe flexion, and instability of the first MTP joint. Such injuries should be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon. Acute treatment for all injuries involves icing, protection (support that prevents first MTP extension), and elevation. Crutches may be needed for more severe injuries to rest the foot and facilitate healing. Athletes recovering from turf toe may benefit from additional support as they return to play, such as the taping shown in the following graphic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F100194\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100194 \">picture 26</a>).</p><p>In certain sports, the plantar plate of the first MTP joint is at higher risk of injury.

An even rarer cause of metatarsal area pain is polymetatarsia, which is caused when a fourth or fifth metatarsal is duplicated either in the presence or absence of polydactyly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3884582355\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical conditions causing forefoot pain</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3082931222\"><span class=\"h3\">Gout</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gout is a disease of urate crystal deposition that can cause intense, recurrent attacks of inflammatory arthritis of the first MTP joint. The first MTP joint continues to be the most common location of gout attacks, and a meta-analysis found that 73 percent of over 2000 gout patients had developed first MTP arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, gout can affect sesamoids, interphalangeal joints, and other areas of the forefoot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. With the exception of major trauma, few conditions produce MTP joint pain as intense as that described by gout patients. Gout often has specific findings on plain radiograph and ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52500\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52500 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F85635\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85635 \">image 6</a>).
