Elevated tissue glucose levels in diabetic patients may provide a more favorable microenvironment for gas-forming microbes. However, bacterial gas production does not fully explain the pathologic and clinical manifestations of emphysematous UTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3698023971\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These infections are usually due to <em>Escherichia coli</em> or <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]; other causative organisms include <em>Proteus</em>,<em> Enterococcus</em>,<em> Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Clostridium</em>, and, rarely, <em>Candida</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

In different series, diabetes was present in more than 80 percent of patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4,6,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,11-13</a>], at least 50 percent of patients with emphysematous pyelitis, and 60 to 70 percent of patients with emphysematous cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. In addition, most patients were women, similar to the predominance of women in acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4,5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,14</a>], and most patients were over age 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4,5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,14</a>].</p><p>One of the largest published experiences comes from a retrospective study of 48 patients in Taiwan who were diagnosed with either emphysematous pyelonephritis or emphysematous pyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Diabetes was present in 96 percent and urinary tract obstruction in 22 percent. The mean patient age was 60 years (range 37 to 83 years) and women outnumbered men 6:1. Similar findings were noted in a literature review of 135 patients with emphysematous cystitis: diabetes was present in 67 percent, the mean age was 66 years, and women accounted for 64 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In other smaller series of patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis, urinary tract obstruction was present in 0 to 50 percent of patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/6,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,13</a>]. In contrast, obstruction was present in all six patients without diabetes in two reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13</a>]. The main causes of urinary tract obstruction were papillary necrosis and, less often, ureteral calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a gas-forming UTI is usually made by plain films of the abdomen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography (CT). Such radiographs reveal air in the renal parenchyma, bladder, or surrounding tissue in 50 to 85 percent of cases. CT scanning is more sensitive than plain films and may show the extent of gas formation and any obstructing lesions in the urinary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Imaging, particularly CT scanning, has also been used to classify emphysematous pyelonephritis, which in turn can help make estimates of prognosis and guide therapy.

Emphysematous pyelitis (ie, gas in the renal pelvis) or cystitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F94106\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94106 \">image 2</a>) can occur with or without associated emphysematous pyelonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4,5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of emphysematous pyelonephritis and emphysematous pyelitis are indistinguishable from those seen in severe, acute pyelonephritis. Most patients complain of fevers, chills, flank or abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The onset of symptoms may be abrupt or evolve slowly over two to three weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory testing usually reveals hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, elevated serum creatinine, and pyuria. Acute anuric renal failure is an uncommon complication of emphysematous pyelonephritis that can be seen in patients with bilateral infection or unilateral disease in a solitary functioning kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In the series of 48 patients cited above, bacteremia was present in 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. All organisms isolated from blood cultures were simultaneously found in cultures of the urine or renal pus. <em>E. coli</em> (69 percent) and <em>K. pneumoniae</em> (29 percent) were the predominant pathogens. Two patients had a polymicrobial infection with <em>E. coli</em> plus group B <em>Streptococcus</em> or <em>Proteus</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951744842\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of emphysematous pyelonephritis or pyelitis can be similar to that of severe, acute pyelonephritis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=xanthogranulomatous-pyelonephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis&quot;</a>), or acute papillary necrosis. These conditions are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Computed tomography (CT) findings can help differentiate between these possibilities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, treatment of emphysematous pyelonephritis or pyelitis usually involved nephrectomy or open drainage along with systemic antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/6,12,13,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,13,19,20</a>]. In more recent reports, successful management with systemic antibiotics together with percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) of gas and purulent material, as well as relief of urinary tract obstruction (if present), has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4,6,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,21-23</a>]. A systematic review of 10 retrospective studies including 210 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis noted that mortality associated with medical management plus percutaneous catheter drainage was significantly lower than medical management plus emergent nephrectomy (13.5 versus 25 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Regardless of the type of drainage or surgery used, all patients require treatment with parenteral antibiotics; antibiotic selection is as outlined elsewhere for the management of acute complicated pyelonephritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults#H12414288\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognostic classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the findings seen on CT scan, two classification systems have been proposed to estimate prognosis and guide therapy. One classification system divided emphysematous pyelonephritis into two types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I &mdash; Renal parenchymal necrosis with either absence of fluid collection or the presence of a streaky or mottled gas pattern</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II &mdash; Renal or perirenal fluid accompanied by a bubbly gas pattern or gas in the collecting system</p><p/><p>Differences between the imaging results seen in types I and II may reflect the fact that vascular thrombosis is also present in type I. Patients with type I patterns had a more fulminant course characterized by a significantly shorter duration from symptom onset to diagnosis (4 versus 11 days) and a significantly higher mortality rate (69 versus 18 percent with type II). Also, type I was associated with necrosis and hemorrhagic infarction on pathologic examination compared with diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells and abscess formation in type II. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for adverse outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>Emphysematous pyelonephritis or pyelitis may be alternatively categorized into four prognostic classes based upon CT scan findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class 1: Gas in the collecting system only (ie, emphysematous pyelitis); this finding may be associated with severe obstruction at the site of the pyelitis in some patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class 2: Gas in the renal parenchyma without extension to the extrarenal space</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class 3A: Extension of gas or abscess to the perinephric space (defined as the area between the fibrous renal capsule and the renal fascia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class 3B: Extension of gas or abscess to the pararenal space (defined as the space beyond the renal fascia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extension to adjacent tissues such as the psoas muscle)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class 4: Bilateral emphysematous pyelonephritis or a solitary functioning kidney with emphysematous pyelonephritis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors for adverse outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient outcomes with emphysematous pyelonephritis or pyelitis vary with the classification system type and other factors. We prefer the classification system using four categories over the one using two, because the four-category system links the type of class to specific therapeutic approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Adverse outcomes and mortality were with one exception limited to class 3 or 4 disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 16 patients with class 1 to 2 disease, there was one death (in a patient treated with antibiotics alone) and PCD was effective in all patients in whom it was attempted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 28 patients with class 3 disease, six died (21 percent) and 11 (39 percent) had PCD procedures that were considered unsuccessful due to progressive or persistent lesions.

The success rate with PCD and antibiotics was 85 percent in patients with no or one risk factor compared with 8 percent in patients with two or more risk factors. </p><p>Subsequently a meta-analysis of seven retrospective cohort studies examined 23 risk factors in 175 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The overall mortality rate was 25 percent.

Type I was associated with a significantly higher mortality than type II in both the report of this classification system (69 versus 18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and in the series of 48 cases (36 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative therapy, defined as fluid resuscitation and antimicrobials without PCD</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia</p><p/><p>Similar results were noted in a prospective study of 39 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In this study patients were treated with medical management plus PCD. Repeat imaging was performed after three days and additional drainage tubes were placed if needed. If there was no clinical improvement, early nephrectomy was performed. Patients who improved with medical management plus PCD underwent delayed nephrectomy if they developed recurrent pyelonephritis or had a poorly functioning kidney on nuclear imaging. The overall mortality rate was 13 percent. Thrombocytopenia, renal failure, altered mental status, and severe hyponatremia were significantly associated with mortality. Renal parenchymal destruction of &gt;50 percent based on CT significantly predicted the need for nephrectomy and predicted death. The early nephrectomy group had a higher mortality rate (three of seven) whereas the PCD-treated patients had a lower mortality rate (2 of 24). There were no deaths among patients who had initial PCD followed by delayed nephrectomy.</p><p>A separate retrospective study of 44 patients diagnosed with emphysematous pyelonephritis (8 with class 1 disease, 12 with class 2, 11 with class 3A, 7 with class 3B, 4 with class 4, and 2 with unknown class) from 2001 to 2013 at the National Taiwan University Hospital found a survival rate of 88.6 percent (39 of 44) despite only one patient undergoing immediate nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Need for emergent hemodialysis, shock on presentation, altered mental status, severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin &lt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment, and polymicrobial infection were more common in non-survivors than survivors.

However, bladder irrigation may be needed if blood clots are present, and catheter placement is often required if the patient cannot adequately void. Rarely, bladder debridement and partial or total cystectomy are necessary. In a review of 135 published cases, 10 percent required combined medical and surgical therapy and the overall mortality rate in this group of patients was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Parenteral antibiotic selection is as outlined elsewhere for the management of pyelonephritis (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Suggested approach'</a> above). The duration of antimicrobial therapy depends upon the clinical response. A review of 20 cases of emphysematous cystitis for which there were data on duration of treatment reported a median length of antibiotic treatment of 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2548786592\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

They can manifest as cystitis, pyelitis (gas in the renal pelvis), or pyelonephritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of emphysematous pyelonephritis are indistinguishable from those seen in severe acute pyelonephritis. <em>E. coli</em> and <em>K. pneumoniae</em> account for most cases. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain is the major clinical manifestation of emphysematous cystitis, while classic symptoms of cystitis (dysuria, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency) occur in about one-half of cases. Pneumaturia may be seen after bladder catheterization. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major risk factors for emphysematous UTIs are diabetes and urinary tract obstruction. The infections primarily occur in women at a mean age of about 60 years. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for adverse outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of emphysematous UTIs is made by abdominal imaging; computed tomography is more sensitive than plain films and can detect obstructing lesions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse outcomes and mortality are highest when there is extension of gas or abscess to the perinephric or pararenal space (class 3 disease) or involvement of both kidneys or a solitary functioning kidney (class 4 disease). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8160536\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend parenteral antibiotic therapy for the treatment of all emphysematous urinary tract infections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In certain cases, other interventions may be warranted, as below. Antibiotic selection is as outlined elsewhere for the management of acute complicated pyelonephritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults#H12414288\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with class 1 disease (pyelitis) who do not have abscess formation or obstruction, we suggest treatment with antibiotics alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Suggested approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For other patients with class 1 disease and all patients with class 2 disease (gas limited to the renal parenchyma), we suggest treatment with percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) and, if present, relief of urinary tract obstruction in addition to antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Suggested approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of patients with class 3A or 3B disease (extension of gas or abscess into the perinephric or perirenal space) depends on the presence of the following risk factors: thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, impaired consciousness, or shock (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Suggested approach'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For such patients who have none or only one risk factor, we suggest treatment with PCD and, if present, relief of urinary tract obstruction in addition to antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Nephrectomy should be performed if PCD is unsuccessful. However, some urologists feel that early nephrectomy is warranted in all patients with class 3 disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For such patients with two or more of the above risk factors, we suggest immediate nephrectomy in addition to antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with class 4 disease (bilateral involvement or infection in a solitary functioning kidney) we suggest treatment with bilateral PCD and, if present, relief of urinary tract obstruction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Suggested approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with emphysematous cystitis who have intravesicular blood clots or cannot adequately void, bladder irrigation may be needed in addition to parenteral antibiotics. Otherwise, antibiotic therapy alone is usually sufficient. Approximately 10 percent of patients require surgery for debridement, or rarely, partial or total cystectomy.
