Upper UTI (ie, acute pyelonephritis) may lead to renal scarring, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. Although children with pyelonephritis tend to present with fever, it is often difficult on clinical grounds to distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis, particularly in young children (those younger than two years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-and-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, we have defined UTI broadly here without attempting to distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis. Acute cystitis in older children is discussed separately.

In a retrospective cohort study of 482 children with febrile UTI, renal scarring occurred in 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-and-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The risk of renal scarring was increased with increasing duration of fever before initiation of antibiotics (approximately 5 percent with duration of one to two days, 7.5 to 8 percent with duration of two to three days, and 14 percent with duration of &gt;3 days). For every hour that antimicrobial therapy is delayed, the odds of new renal scarring increased by approximately 1 percent; thus, a delay of 48 hours increased the risk of scarring by approximately 50 percent (ie, from 5 to 7.5 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of another potential source of fever (upper respiratory tract infection, acute otitis media, acute gastroenteritis) does not rule out the possibility of UTI. In studies of UTI in young children who presented to the emergency department with fever, the prevalence of UTI in children with and without another potential source of fever on examination ranged from 2 to 3 percent and 6 to 8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-and-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].

Older children may have urinary symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, back pain, dysuria, frequency, new-onset urinary incontinence). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important aspects of the history in a child with suspected UTI include features of the acute illness (eg, fever, urinary symptoms) and risk factors for UTI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76804 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections in children: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Host factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The examination of the child with suspected UTI should include measurement of blood pressure, temperature, and growth parameters; abdominal examination for tenderness or mass; assessment of suprapubic and costovertebral tenderness; examination of the external genitalia; evaluation of the lower back for signs of occult myelomeningocele; and a search for other sources of fever. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory evaluation for the child with suspected UTI includes obtaining a urine sample for a dipstick <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microscopic evaluation and urine culture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82157 \">table 2</a>). Urine culture is necessary to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that urine samples be obtained for urinalysis and culture in the following patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59396%7EPEDS%2F74329%7EPEDS%2F75971\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59396 graphicRef74329 graphicRef75971 \">algorithm 1A-C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Decision to obtain'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Febrile girls and uncircumcised boys younger than two years with at least one risk factor for UTI (history of UTI, temperature &gt;39&deg;C, fever without apparent source [particularly if the child will be treated with antibiotics], ill appearance, suprapubic tenderness, fever &gt;24 hours, or nonblack race).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Febrile circumcised boys younger than two years with suprapubic tenderness or at least two risk factors for UTI (history of UTI, temperature &gt;39&deg;C, fever without apparent source, ill appearance, suprapubic tenderness, fever &gt;24 hours, or nonblack race).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Girls and uncircumcised boys older than two years with any of the following urinary or abdominal symptoms (abdominal pain, back pain, dysuria, frequency, high fever, or new-onset incontinence).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Circumcised boys older than two years with multiple urinary symptoms (abdominal pain, back pain, dysuria, frequency, high fever, or new-onset incontinence).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Febrile infants and children with abnormalities of the urinary tract or family history of urinary tract disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheterization is the preferred method of urine collection for infants and children who are not toilet-trained. Clean catch is the preferred method of collection for toilet-trained children. We recommend that urine obtained in a sterile bag not be used for culture. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'How to obtain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that urine culture be performed routinely for all children in whom UTI is a diagnostic consideration and in whom a sample for urinalysis or dipstick is collected. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Urine culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of UTI requires laboratory confirmation. UTI is best defined as significant bacteriuria in a patient with pyuria on dipstick or microscopic urinalysis. We define significant bacteriuria as recovery of &ge;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> of a single uropathogen from a clean catch specimen, &ge;50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> of a single uropathogen from a catheterized specimen, and any uropathogenic bacteria from a suprapubic aspirate. If the urine culture demonstrates significant growth of <em>Enterococcus</em>, <em>Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas</em> <em>aeruginosa </em>in a child with symptoms of UTI, UTI may be diagnosed in the absence of pyuria. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Significant bacteriuria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Pyuria'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-and-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hoberman A, Charron M, Hickey RW, et al.
