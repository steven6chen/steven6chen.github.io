This process begins with the formation of the platelet plug, followed by activation of the clotting cascade and propagation of the clot. The central feature of the clotting cascade is its sequential activation of a series of proenzymes or inactive precursor proteins (zymogens) to active enzymes, resulting in significant stepwise response amplification, (eg, the generation of a small number of factor VIIa molecules will activate many molecules of factor X, which in turn generates even larger numbers of thrombin molecules). The local generation of fibrin meshes and reinforces the platelet plug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69920 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>One of the major multicomponent complexes in the coagulation cascade is the intrinsic X-ase (ten-ase). This complex consists of activated factor IX (factor IXa) as the protease, activated factor VIII (factor VIIIa), calcium, and phospholipids as the cofactors, and factor X as the substrate. Factor IXa can be generated by either factor XIa, activation of the intrinsic pathway, or by the tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">factor/factor</span> VIIa complex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Multicomponent complexes'</a>.)</p><p>Although the generation or exposure of tissue factor at the wound site is the primary physiologic event in initiating clotting via the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway X-ase is important because of the limited amount of tissue factor generated in vivo and the presence of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor which, when complexed with factor Xa, inhibits the tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">factor/factor</span> VIIa complex. Thus, sustained generation of thrombin depends upon the activation of factor IX and factor VIII. This process is amplified because factor VIII is activated by both factor Xa and thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and factor IX is activated by factor XIa via thrombin, as well as by factor VIIa; as a result, a progressive increase in factor VIII and factor IX activation occurs as factor Xa and thrombin are formed.</p><p>The biology of factor VIII and factor IX is reviewed here. Deficiencies in either of these coagulation factors lead to hemophilia (hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively), which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTOR VIII</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The factor VIII gene is located on the X chromosome. It is one of the largest known genes, divided into 26 exons that span 186,000 base pairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Factor VIII is synthesized as a single chain polypeptide of 2351 amino acids. A 19-amino acid signal peptide is cleaved by a protease shortly after synthesis so that circulating plasma factor VIII is a heterodimer.</p><p>Factor VIII circulates in plasma in a noncovalent complex with von Willebrand factor. Cleavage of plasma factor VIII by thrombin or factor Xa at Arg372 and Arg1689 is necessary to activate factor VIII and allow it to participate in the intrinsic pathway X-ase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Activated factor VIII is inactivated by activated protein C in conjunction with protein S; the site of proteolytic inactivation is Arg336 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor VIII consists of a heavy chain with A1 and A2 domains; a connecting region with a B domain; and a light chain with A3, C1, and C2 domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

A different site in the C2 domain appears to contain the binding site for factor Xa.

Endothelial cell knockout of the factor VIII gene or the gene responsible for factor VIII secretion cause hemophilia in mice, whereas liver-specific knockout of either gene does not affect plasma factor VIII levels.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Binding to von Willebrand factor'</a> below.)</p><p>Factor VIII was previously thought to be produced at least partially by the liver, based on observations from liver transplantation experiments in animals. Liver transplantation from an animal without hemophilia to a hemophilic animal partially corrected factor VIII deficiency in the recipient, and liver transplantation from a hemophilic animal into a non-hemophilic animal partially depleted factor VIII in the recipient. The presence of a significant vascular bed in the transplanted liver may explain this finding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Binding to von Willebrand factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor VIII circulates in plasma in a noncovalent complex with von Willebrand factor (VWF).

VWF can bind factor VIII only when factor VIII has not been cleaved by thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. After thrombin cleavage, activated factor VIII (factor VIIIa) is released from VWF and becomes a fully functional, active cofactor in the ongoing generation of thrombin; however, it is also now more susceptible to inactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The clinical importance of VWF binding can be illustrated by the findings in type 2N von Willebrand disease (VWD) and in some factor VIII mutations leading to decreased binding to VWF:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2N VWD, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, is characterized by mutations in VWF within the factor VIII binding domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

Type 2N VWD, rather than hemophilia A, should be suspected in females who present with isolated factor VIII deficiency (with normal levels of VWF) and in families in which an autosomal (rather than X-linked) inheritance pattern for factor VIII deficiency is suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Concurrently, cleavage at Arg372 converts the heavy chain into 54 kd and 44 kd fragments. At the same time, a small fragment is cleaved from the light chain to separate factor VIII from VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These cleavages produce the activated factor VIII heterotrimer factor VIIIa, which is composed of the 54 kd and 44 kd heavy chain fragments and the 72 kd light chain fragment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrinsic pathway X-ase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic role of factor VIII is to accelerate the cleavage of factor X by factor IXa; the binding sites for factor IXa are in the A2 and A3 domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. As noted above, the intrinsic X-ase complex consists of factor IX; the protease; factor X; the substrate; and the cofactors, factor VIIIa, calcium, and phospholipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/2,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30</a>]. It has been proposed that factor VIIIa has a stabilizing action that forces the catalytic modules factor IXa and factor X together, markedly accelerating the velocity of the X-ase complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, the enzyme and the substrate are concentrated on a phospholipid surface of activated platelets or endothelial cells, decreasing the Km by several orders of magnitude.</p><p>Factor VIII cannot become part of the X-ase complex until it is released from VWF, because interaction with VWF inhibits its binding to phospholipid surfaces. The separation from VWF requires the cleavage of the factor VIII light chain by thrombin or factor Xa.</p><p>Although the generation or exposure of tissue factor at the wound site is the primary physiologic event in initiating clotting via the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway X-ase also is required for normal hemostasis, as illustrated by the bleeding disorders associated with hemophilia A and B. The importance of the intrinsic pathway reflects the limited amount of tissue factor generated in vivo and the presence of tissue factor pathway inhibitor which, when complexed with factor Xa, inhibits the tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">factor/factor</span> VIIa complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, sustained generation of thrombin depends upon the activation of both factor IX and factor VIII. This process is amplified because factor VIII is activated by both factor Xa and thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and factor IX is activated by thrombin-induced activation of factor XI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]; as a result, there is a progressive increase in activation of factors VIII and IX as factor Xa and thrombin are formed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The inactivation of factor VIIIa occurs by subunit dissociation in a process that is initiated by the formation of thrombin. The binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin induces a conformational change in thrombin such that it acquires the ability to activate protein C and no longer promotes platelet activation or the cleavage of fibrinogen.
