Another word for birth control is &quot;contraception.&quot;</p><p>Different types of birth control include medicines, devices, and procedures. Some types of birth control are used by women, and others are used by men. Some types need to be used every time a person has sex. Other types can prevent pregnancy for long periods of time. Some types need a doctor's prescription, and others do not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46966074\"><span class=\"h1\">Which type of birth control should I choose?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Choosing birth control can be tough, because no birth control is perfect. Your doctor or nurse can help you choose the type that is right for you. To help you make a decision, think about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well it prevents pregnancy &ndash; No birth control works 100 percent perfectly all the time, but some prevent pregnancy better than others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often you have to use it &ndash; For example, women who use birth control pills must take them every day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How easy it is to use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Its side effects or downsides</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Its cost</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you want to get pregnant in the future &ndash; Some types of birth control are permanent, meaning they prevent you from ever getting pregnant. Other types of birth control prevent pregnancy only for a limited amount of time. After that time, you can still get pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether it protects you from infection &ndash; Only male and female condoms can reduce your chance of getting certain infections called &quot;STIs&quot; (sexually transmitted infections).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46966081\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different types of birth control and how do they work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different types of birth control prevent pregnancy in different ways and have different levels of effectiveness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73238\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73238 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F88535\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88535 \">figure 2</a>). Each of the main types is discussed in more detail elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F88695\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88695 \">table 1</a>). They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barrier methods, such as condoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal birth control, such as the pill</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-acting methods, such as the IUD or implant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Permanent sterilization</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5745320\"><span class=\"h1\">What about natural forms of birth control?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few forms of &quot;natural&quot; birth control, which require no medicines or devices. But they are not as effective as the other forms of birth control. Natural birth control methods include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawal &ndash; This is when the man pulls out before he ejaculates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fertility awareness &ndash; This is when the woman keeps track of her menstrual cycle so she can predict when she is most likely to get pregnant each month. Then, she avoids sex during that time, or uses some form of birth control then, such as a condom.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeeding &ndash; Breastfeeding can decrease a woman's ability to get pregnant. Some women use it as a form of birth control for the first few weeks after a baby is born. But for it to work, breast milk should be the baby's only food. The medical term for this method is &quot;lactational amenorrhea method,&quot; or &quot;LAM.&quot; If you decide to try this method, discuss it with your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46966088\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have problems with my birth control?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any side effects or problems with your birth control. Sometimes, side effects will go away after a few months. If they don't, you might need to work with your doctor or nurse to find a different type of birth control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46966151\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hormonal birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-devices-iud-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Intrauterine devices (IUD) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Emergency contraception (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sterilization-for-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sterilization for women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vasectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-control-which-method-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Birth control; which method is right for me?
