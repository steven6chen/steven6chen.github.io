A &quot;deficiency&quot; means that your body does not have as much of something as it needs.</p><p>People can have <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> deficiency, or both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28578465\"><span class=\"h1\">Why are vitamin B12 and folic acid important?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your body needs <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> for many things. For example, you need vitamin B12 to make new blood cells, such as red blood cells, and for your nervous system to work normally.</p><p>Your body needs <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>, too, to make new cells. Folic acid is especially important for women who are planning to get pregnant (or might get pregnant). That's because folic acid is needed, especially during the first few weeks of pregnancy, for a baby to develop normally. Folic acid is needed for the spinal cord to develop correctly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28578480\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes vitamin B12 deficiency or folic acid deficiency?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can get <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> deficiency when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They don't eat enough foods that have the vitamin in them &ndash; This is more common in the case of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>, which is found in plants. It can also be the cause of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency for people who eat a vegetarian diet and do not take extra vitamin B12. (Vitamin B12 is found in meats and animal products like eggs.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They eat foods with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>, but their body can't absorb or use the vitamins normally &ndash; These things can happen with certain medical problems or as a side effect of certain medicines. This is more common in the case of vitamin B12.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28578495\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency and folic acid deficiency?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A deficiency of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>, or both can cause anemia.

He or she might do other tests to find out if it&rsquo;s because of a medical condition or a problem with your diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28578540\"><span class=\"h1\">How are vitamin B12 deficiency and folic acid deficiency treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors treat <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency by giving people vitamin B12. The treatment comes as a shot, as pills, or as a nasal spray. Most people with vitamin B12 deficiency need vitamin B12 shots, especially at first. Later, some people can switch to taking vitamin B12 pills or using a nasal spray instead of getting shots.</p><p>Doctors treat <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> deficiency by giving people folic acid. This treatment comes as a pill. Women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant should also make sure they are getting enough folic acid.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will also treat the cause of your deficiency, if it can be treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28578555\"><span class=\"h1\">Can vitamin B12 deficiency and folic acid deficiency be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can lower your chances of getting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> deficiency by eating foods that have the vitamins in them. Foods with vitamin B12 include all kinds of meat, fish, and animal products like eggs and milk. Foods with folic acid include fruits and green leafy vegetables. Many grains, like bread and cereals, have vitamin B12 added to them.</p><p>If you don't eat these foods, your doctor or nurse might recommend that you take a vitamin supplement. Vitamin supplements are pills, capsules, or liquids that have nutrients in them.</p><p>If you are a strict vegetarian or vegan and do not eat any meats, dairy foods, or eggs, you will not get enough <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin B12</a> from your diet alone. To avoid getting vitamin B12 deficiency, you will need to take a vitamin B12 supplement or eat foods with vitamin B12 added to them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28578570\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, you should start taking a multivitamin at least 1 month before you start trying to get pregnant. Choose a &quot;prenatal&quot; multivitamin that has at least 400 micrograms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>. Show your doctor or nurse the vitamin you plan to take to make sure the doses are right for you and your baby. Too much of some vitamins can be harmful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28578585\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diet and health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-and-nutrition-for-women-who-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health and nutrition for women who breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-before-and-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nutrition before and during pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diet and health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-health-and-nutrition-during-breastfeeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Maternal health and nutrition during breastfeeding (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
