Clinical trials have found that both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic approaches are efficacious for panic disorder. With the revision of DSM-IV to DSM-5, agoraphobia is diagnosed independently of panic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In general, trials have shown SSRIs to reduce the frequency of panic attacks, severity of anticipatory anxiety, and degree of phobic avoidance &ndash; the core components of panic disorder. </p><p>As an example, 168 patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> or placebo in a 10-week trial. Patients receiving sertraline experienced a greater mean reduction in the number of panic attacks per week compared with patients receiving placebo (88 versus 53 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Trials have shown that therapeutic effects, particularly on anticipatory anxiety and phobic avoidance, can continue to increase over the first 6 to 12 months of treatment in many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>Virtually every clinical trial of SSRIs for panic disorder that measured phobic avoidance has found a reduction in agoraphobic symptoms in patients treated with the antidepressant compared with placebo.

Selection of a particular medication should be guided by differences in side effect profile, propensity for medication interactions, half-life, and availability of less expensive, generic preparations.

If the patient is able to tolerate these doses without anxiety, jitteriness, or insomnia, the doses can be gradually titrated beginning three to seven days after initiation. The SSRI should be titrated to a therapeutic dose over two to six weeks (20 to 40 mg fluoxetine, 20 to 40 mg paroxetine, 100 to 200 mg sertraline, 20 to 40 mg of citalopram, and 10 to 20 mg of escitalopram). </p><p>A trial of an SSRI should be dosed at the lower end of the therapeutic range for two to four weeks; at that point the dose can be increased if clinical improvement is not seen. Increases should occur no faster than at one to two week intervals. Although one small placebo-controlled study did not support <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> dose increases as more effective in nonresponsive panic disorder, one should move to the higher end of these dose ranges if there continue to be symptoms at the lower therapeutic doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>When the decision is made to discontinue an SSRI for panic disorder, a slow taper over several months is generally recommended. In instances where more rapid taper is desired (eg, if patient becomes pregnant and if it is felt that the SSRI should not be continued during pregnancy) then this can be accomplished over several days, if necessary (eg, 150 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> to 50 mg sertraline immediately, and then discontinue completely after two to three days), acknowledging that SSRI withdrawal symptoms may ensue.

Venlafaxine reduces all three core components of panic disorder (attack frequency, anticipatory anxiety, and phobic avoidance). </p><p>As an example, 664 nondepressed adults with panic disorder were randomly assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> ER (75 or 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. After 12 weeks, patients receiving venlafaxine were more likely to be free of full symptom panic attacks compared with patients on placebo (54.4 to 59.7 versus 35.3 percent). Response rates to venlafaxine ER and paroxetine were approximately equal. </p><p>There is no evidence that the small and subtle advantages of SNRIs over SSRIs observed in depression studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] apply to panic disorder.

The immediate release version of venlafaxine should not be used for panic disorder because of its much greater side effect burden and the difficulty panic disorder patients have tolerating internal bodily sensations and somatic side effects. Dose should be raised to 75 mg at one week, and 150 mg by two to three weeks. This medication has a linear dose response curve in depression studies, and in one of the panic disorder studies the higher dose appeared somewhat more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Benzodiazepines reduced each of the three components of panic disorder (attack frequency, anticipatory anxiety, and phobic avoidance). </p><p>The principal disadvantage of benzodiazepines is the risk of abuse and addiction. Their use should be limited to patients without an active substance use disorder (SUD) or SUD history involving benzodiazepines or other prescription drugs. These medications should be prescribed carefully in patients with a history of other SUDs (including alcohol).</p><p>Onset of the anti-panic effects of benzodiazepines is very rapid, beginning within the first week of treatment. This may be a distinct advantage in severely symptomatic and functionally impaired patients who require rapid relief in order to avoid further clinical deterioration. </p><p>Among benzodiazepines, we favor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>, which has several advantages over the frequently prescribed short acting agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a>, for panic disorder. Clonazepam&rsquo;s longer half-life allows dosing once to twice daily, versus the three to four times daily required for alprazolam. Alprazolam XR, an extended-release formulation of alprazolam, demonstrated to be effective in a controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], requires twice daily dosing according to most clinical experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]<strong>.</strong> Alprazolam is associated with more inter-dose anxiety, as effects can wear off rapidly in some patients, causing more anxiety before the next dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. When alprazolam&rsquo;s faster onset of action, due to greater lipid solubility and brain penetration, is combined with its short half-life, these effects can strongly reinforce pill-taking to alleviate anxiety, can enhance potential for abuse, and may reduce self-efficacy (ie, patients&rsquo; confidence that they can manage their anxiety on their own). Clonazepam has less intensive symptoms on discontinuation than alprazolam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Patients appear to have more difficulty stopping benzodiazepines and tolerating the effects of discontinuation (which can include hyperarousal, rebound worsening of anxiety, insomnia, tremor and seizures) compared with SSRIs, which have their own discontinuation syndrome. If the patient is not already taking an antidepressant, benzodiazepine monotherapy will not treat a comorbid major depression nor prevent its emergence.

These drugs differ in the extent of supporting evidence, their side effect profiles, and in the case of benzodiazepines, their potential for abuse. (See <a href=\"#H11968364\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because patients with panic disorder are unusually sensitive to overstimulation effects with antidepressants, treatment should be started at low doses. There is a two-to-four week delay with antidepressants in the onset of a therapeutic effect when treating panic disorder. Clinical response can take up to 8 to 12 weeks for some patients, while therapeutic effects, particularly on anticipatory anxiety and phobic avoidance, can continue to increase over the first 6 to 12 months of treatment in many patients. (See <a href=\"#H2874413089\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricyclic antidepressants are effective for panic disorder but are more poorly tolerated than SSRIs or SNRIs, with adverse somatic effects that may trigger these patients&rsquo; intolerance of internal bodily sensations, possibly exacerbating their panic. Before initiating treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant, patients must be screened for cardiac conduction system delays via medical and family history, physical exam, laboratory tests, and, for patients over age 40, an electrocardiogram. (See <a href=\"#H11968463\" class=\"local\">'Tricyclic antidepressants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benzodiazepines have been found to be efficacious for panic disorder. Benzodiazepines have the advantage of more rapid onset of therapeutic effects compared with antidepressants but have a risk of abuse. They may also be used along with an antidepressant early in treatment, with the aim of expediting response and, possibly, tolerability. Their use should be limited to patients without an active substance use disorder (SUD) or history of an SUD involving alcohol, benzodiazepines or other prescription drugs. They should be prescribed carefully in patients with a history of other SUDs. (See <a href=\"#H237289673\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If effective, pharmacotherapy should be continued for at least one year after symptom control has been attained. Decisions about discontinuation should be based on a prior history of relapse and the presence of risk factors for relapse, including the severity of the initial syndrome or the presence of psychiatric comorbidity (depression, agoraphobia, or personality disorder), ongoing psychosocial or medical stress, and any residual symptoms of phobia, anticipatory anxiety or subclinical panic.
