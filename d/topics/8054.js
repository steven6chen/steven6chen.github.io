These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malignancy</strong> &ndash; Tumor growth can cause bone pain, and some children with malignancies (particularly leukemia and Ewing sarcoma) have fever as part of their initial presentation. Unlike those with osteomyelitis, symptoms can be intermittent in children with cancer. Affected children also fail to respond to empiric antibiotic therapy. Osteomyelitis and cancer involving bone are usually differentiated with bone biopsy.

Unlike bone disease with hemoglobinopathy, osteomyelitis does not respond to hydration and other supportive measures.

During bone pain crises, ischemia can be detected by technetium bone scan. Radiographs of the distal femur may demonstrate deformities caused by abnormal modeling of the metaphysis that are characteristic of Gaucher disease.

If needed, additional evaluation generally includes advanced imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or scintigraphy. If it is available, MRI is preferred to scintigraphy in view of its higher degree of sensitivity and spatial resolution; however scintigraphy may be better if symptoms are poorly localized or multiple areas of involvement are suspected, and can often be performed without the need for sedation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96521\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96521 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96767\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96767 \">table 1</a>).
