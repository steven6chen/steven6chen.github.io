In a national survey from Japan, the incidence of thyroid storm in hospitalized patients was 0.20 per 100,000 per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. It may be precipitated by an acute event such as thyroid or nonthyroidal surgery, trauma, infection, an acute iodine load, or parturition. In addition to specific therapy directed against the thyroid, supportive therapy in an intensive care unit (ICU) and recognition and treatment of any precipitating factors is essential since the mortality rate of thyroid storm is substantial (10 to 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>]. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of thyroid storm will be reviewed here. The general topic of hyperthyroidism (without thyroid storm), including diagnosis, causes, and treatment, is reviewed separately.

In addition, irregular use or discontinuation of antithyroid drugs is a commonly reported precipitant of thyroid storm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The advent of appropriate preoperative preparation of hyperthyroid patients undergoing nonthyroidal surgery or thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism has led to a dramatic reduction in the prevalence of surgically induced thyroid storm. </p><p>It is unclear why certain factors result in the development of thyroid storm. Hypotheses include a rapid rate of increase in serum thyroid hormone levels, increased responsiveness to catecholamines, or enhanced cellular responses to thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The degree of thyroid hormone excess (elevation of thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3], suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) typically is not more profound than that seen in patients with uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis. However, one study found that while the total T4 and T3 levels were similar to those seen in uncomplicated patients, the free T4 and free T3 concentrations were higher in patients with thyroid storm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15056278\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe and life-threatening thyrotoxicosis typically have an exaggeration of the usual symptoms of hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57436952\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular symptoms in many patients include tachycardia to rates that can exceed 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> and congestive heart failure. Hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and death from cardiovascular collapse may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one series of 28 cases, cardiac manifestations were predominant, with &gt;60 percent having severe tachycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Hyperpyrexia to 104 to 106&deg;F is common. Agitation, anxiety, delirium, psychosis, stupor, or coma are also common and are considered by many to be essential to the diagnosis. In one series, altered mentation was the only clinical finding that distinguished &quot;storm&quot; from &quot;compensated&quot; hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and in another series, was statistically associated with mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a retrospective study from Japan, older age &gt;60 years, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, requirement of mechanical ventilation, and nonuse of antithyroid drugs or beta blockers were associated with higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other symptoms may include severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or hepatic failure with jaundice. </p><p>Physical examination may reveal goiter, ophthalmopathy (in the presence of Graves' disease), lid lag, hand tremor, and warm and moist skin. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57436958\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with overt primary hyperthyroidism have low TSH and high free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T3 concentrations. The degree of thyroid hormone excess typically is not more profound than that seen in patients with uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis. Other nonspecific laboratory findings may include mild hyperglycemia, mild hypercalcemia, abnormal liver function tests, leukocytosis, or leukopenia. Hyperglycemia is secondary to a catecholamine-induced inhibition of insulin release and increased glycogenolysis. Hypercalcemia may occur due to hemoconcentration and enhanced bone resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13827326\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of thyroid storm is based upon the presence of severe and life-threatening symptoms (hyperpyrexia, cardiovascular dysfunction, altered mentation) in a patient with biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism (elevation of free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T3 and suppression of TSH).</p><p>There are no universally accepted criteria or validated clinical tools for diagnosing thyroid storm. In 1993, Burch and Wartofsky introduced a scoring system using precise clinical criteria for the identification of thyroid storm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60908 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A score of 45 or more is highly suggestive of thyroid storm, whereas a score below 25 makes thyroid storm unlikely. A score of 25 to 44 is suggestive of impending storm. While this scoring system is likely sensitive, it is not very specific. Another diagnostic system based upon similar clinical findings (central nervous system [CNS] manifestations, fever, tachycardia, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal manifestations) has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but this latter system may have reduced sensitivity for making the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Thyroid function tests (TSH) should be assessed in all patients in whom there is a clinical suspicion of thyroid storm (hyperpyrexia with temperature &gt;103&deg;F [39.4&deg;C], goiter, cardiovascular dysfunction, altered mentation, atrial fibrillation, history of antithyroid drug therapy for hyperthyroidism, recent thyroid or nonthyroidal surgery, recent exposure to iodine-containing contrast). If the TSH is below normal, free T4 and T3 should be measured. The degree of hyperthyroidism (elevation of T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T3 and suppression of TSH) in patients with thyroid storm is, in general, comparable with that in patients with uncomplicated overt hyperthyroidism. Thus, the degree of hyperthyroidism is not a criterion for diagnosing thyroid storm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism#H25975064\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Radioiodine uptake is not necessary for the diagnosis of thyroid storm, and treatment should not be delayed for scanning in patients with clinical manifestations of thyroid storm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic options for thyroid storm are expanded from those used for uncomplicated hyperthyroidism, with additional drugs often used such as glucocorticoids and an iodine solution, and the standard drugs are given in higher doses and with more frequent dosing. In addition, full support of the patient in an intensive care unit (ICU) is essential since the mortality rate of thyroid storm is substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>]. In two series of patients with thyroid storm (patients seen between 2006 and 2013), mortality was 8 percent in a Los Angeles hospital and 25 percent in a Singapore hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15056520\"><span class=\"h2\">Our initial approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles of treatment outlined below are based upon clinical experience and case studies since there are no prospective studies. They are frequently also applied to patients with severe hyperthyroidism who do not fully meet the criteria for thyroid storm. The therapeutic regimen typically consists of multiple medications, each of which has a different mechanism of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A beta blocker to control the symptoms and signs induced by increased adrenergic tone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thionamide to block new hormone synthesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An iodine solution to block the release of thyroid hormone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An iodinated radiocontrast agent (if available) to inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids to reduce T4-to-T3 conversion, promote vasomotor stability, and possibly treat an associated relative adrenal insufficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile acid sequestrants may also be of benefit in severe cases to decrease enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormones</p><p/><p>For patients with clinical features of thyroid storm or with severe thyrotoxicosis who do not fully meet the criteria for thyroid storm (ie, impending storm), we begin immediate treatment with a beta blocker (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> in a dose to achieve adequate control of heart rate, typically 60 to 80 mg orally every four to six hours, with appropriate adjustment for heart rate and blood pressure) and either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> (PTU) 200 mg every four hours or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> (20 mg orally every four to six hours). PTU is favored over methimazole because of PTU's effect to decrease T4-to-T3 conversion. One hour <strong>after</strong> the first dose of thionamide is taken, we administer iodine (saturated solution of potassium iodide [SSKI], 5 drops orally every six hours or Lugol's solution, 10 drops every eight hours). The administration of iodine should be delayed for at least one hour <strong>after</strong> thionamide administration to prevent the iodine from being used as substrate for new hormone synthesis.</p><p>For patients with clinical features of thyroid storm, we also administer glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>, 100 mg intravenously every eight hours). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cholestyramine</a> (4 g orally four times daily) may also be of benefit in severe cases to reduce enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormones. Supportive therapy and recognition and treatment of any precipitating factors (eg, infection), in addition to specific therapy directed against the thyroid, may be critical to the final outcome. Many patients require substantial amounts of fluid, while others may require diuresis because of congestive heart failure. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> and beta blocker requirements may be quite high because of increased drug metabolism as a result of hyperthyroidism. Infection needs to be identified and treated, and hyperpyrexia should be aggressively corrected. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> should be used instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> since the latter can increase serum free T4 and T3 concentrations by interfering with their protein binding.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a>, PTU, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> can be administered through a nasogastric tube.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Beta blockers should be used with extreme caution if the patient has decompensated heart failure with systolic dysfunction or other contraindications to beta blockade (eg, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe peripheral vascular disease). It is important to note, however, that control of tachycardia may lead to improvement in cardiac function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> is frequently selected for initial therapy because in high doses, it inhibits the type 1 deiodinase, which may help reduce serum T3 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, it can be given intravenously, but this should only be done in a setting where hemodynamics can be monitored. The intravenous dose is 0.5 to 1 mg over 10 minutes followed by 1 to 2 mg over 10 minutes every few hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. Higher doses may occasionally be required, but care should be taken to avoid hypotension and aggravation of existing heart failure. As an alternative to intravenous administration, propranolol can be given orally or via nasogastric tube in a dose to achieve adequate control of heart rate, typically 60 to 80 mg orally every four to six hours. When transitioning from intravenous to <span class=\"nowrap\">oral/nasogastric</span> treatment, intravenous therapy may need to be continued until adequate effectiveness of the <span class=\"nowrap\">oral/nasogastric</span> treatment is ascertained.</p><p>An alternative regimen is to utilize the short-acting beta blocker <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>. A loading dose of 250 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> is given, followed by an infusion at 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute. This regimen permits rapid titration of the drug to achieve adequate beta blockade while minimizing adverse reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In patients with reactive airways disease, cardioselective beta blockers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> could be considered, but this should be done carefully. In some patients with severe asthma in whom beta blockers might be contraindicated, rate control can be achieved with calcium-channel blockers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Thionamides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thionamides block de novo thyroid hormone synthesis within one to two hours after administration. However, they have no effect on the release of preformed hormone from the thyroid gland. For patients with thyroid storm or severe thyrotoxicosis, we begin immediate treatment with either PTU 200 mg every four hours or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> (20 mg orally every four to six hours). Carbimazole, a third drug that is metabolized to methimazole, is available in the United Kingdom and some former British Commonwealth countries.

PTU, but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a>, blocks T4-to-T3 conversion, and T3 levels drop by approximately 45 percent within 24 hours after PTU but only 10 to 15 percent within 24 hours after methimazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methimazole</a> may be preferred for severe, but not life-threatening, hyperthyroidism because methimazole has a longer duration of action and, after weeks of treatment, results in more rapid normalization of serum T3 compared with PTU and because methimazole is less hepatotoxic.</p><p/><p>Patients started on PTU in the ICU should be transitioned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> before discharge from the hospital. In Japan, methimazole is preferred over PTU, and in a retrospective study of 356 patients, there was no difference in mortality or disease severity in patients receiving methimazole or PTU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and toxicity of thionamides&quot;, section on 'Toxicities and their management'</a>.)</p><p>The dose of thionamide given to patients with thyroid storm is likely higher than that required to completely block thyroid hormone synthesis. Both the substantial mortality associated with thyroid storm and the possibility of poor absorption because of concurrent gastrointestinal dysfunction have been used to justify the higher dose. We typically administer 200 mg of PTU every four hours or 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> every four to six hours, orally or via nasogastric tube.</p><p>Both drugs can be suspended in liquid or made up as a suppository or retention enema for rectal administration, which should be ordered well in advance from the pharmacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79245\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79245 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/9,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21-24</a>]. In one study comparing the use of an enema versus a suppository preparation of PTU, 15 patients with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism were randomly assigned to a PTU enema (eight 50 mg tablets of PTU were dissolved in 90 mL of sterile water) versus two PTU suppositories (200 mg of PTU were dissolved in a polyethylene glycol base and put into each suppository) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The enema form provided better bioavailability than the suppository form (time to peak level 85 versus 172 minutes, maximum peak level 3.89 versus 2.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span>. However, both preparations proved to have comparable therapeutic effect, as measured by a significant decrease in serum free T3 levels.</p><p>For patients intolerant of oral or rectal thionamides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> can be prepared for intravenous administration by dissolving the tablets in pH-neutral isotonic saline and by filtering through a 0.22 micrometer filter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Routine pharmacologic sterility tests are required as dictated by individual hospitals. In one preliminary report, intravenous PTU given in a dose of 576 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> was used to attain euthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Lower doses are used in patients with severe thyrotoxicosis who do not meet criteria for thyroid storm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3999987\"><span class=\"h4\">Patients unable to take a thionamide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although thionamide toxicity is uncommon, some patients are unable to continue thionamides because of rare side effects such as agranulocytosis or hepatotoxicity or because of allergy.

In such patients who require urgent treatment of hyperthyroidism, thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. Patients who are to undergo surgery require preoperative treatment of thyrotoxicosis. We typically treat with beta blockers (if not contraindicated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> in a dose to achieve adequate control of heart rate, typically 60 to 80 mg every four to six hours), glucocorticoids to inhibit conversion of T4 to T3 (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, 1 to 2 mg every six hours), bile acid sequestrants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a> 4 g orally four times daily) to reduce enterohepatic circulation of thyroid hormone, and, in patients with Graves' disease, iodine (SSKI, 5 drops [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">drops/mL,</span> 50 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodide/drop]</span> orally every six hours or Lugol's solution, 10 drops [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">drops/mL,</span> 6.25 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodine/drop]</span> every eight hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>We continue treatment for up to five to seven days. Surgery should not be delayed for more than 8 to 10 days, because of a phenomenon called escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. Large doses of exogenous iodine inhibit the organification of iodine in the thyroid gland (the Wolff-Chaikoff effect). However, this effect is transient. The iodide transport system is able to adapt to higher concentrations of iodine, allowing thyroid hormone synthesis to proceed, with potential exacerbation of thyrotoxicosis.

The administration of iodine should be delayed for at least one hour <strong>after</strong> thionamide administration to prevent the iodine from being used as substrate for new hormone synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Oral doses are potassium iodide-iodine (Lugol's) solution, 10 drops (6.25 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodide/iodine</span> per drop [0.05 mL]) three times daily or SSKI, 5 drops (50 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodide/drop</span> [0.05 mL]) every six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

They are, however, potent inhibitors of T4-to-T3 conversion, and the release of iodine in pharmacologic quantities from these agents has the additional benefit of blocking thyroid hormone release. They have been extremely useful in treating severe hyperthyroidism and in preparing hyperthyroid patients for urgent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. If available, these agents can be given to patients with severe hyperthyroidism at a dose of 0.5 to 1 g once daily.</p><p>Because they are iodinated, they should be given at least one hour <strong>after</strong> the thionamide to prevent the iodine from being used as substrate for new hormone synthesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids also reduce T4-to-T3 conversion.

Their use for the treatment of thyroid storm appears to have improved outcome in at least one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-storm/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. For patients with clinical features of thyroid storm, we administer glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>, 100 mg intravenously every eight hours).

We suggest radioiodine therapy as our first choice for definitive therapy for hyperthyroidism in the absence of moderate to severe orbitopathy, given its lower cost and lower complication rate compared with surgery. If the patient received iodine within a few weeks of planned radioiodine treatment, a radioiodine uptake should be obtained to calculate the radioiodine treatment dose rather than using fixed-dose radioiodine treatment. Surgery is an option for patients with hyperthyroidism due to a very large or obstructive goiter. Preparation for treatment with radioiodine or surgery is reviewed separately.

Although thyroid storm can develop in patients with longstanding untreated hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, solitary toxic adenoma), it is often precipitated by an acute event such as thyroid or nonthyroidal surgery, trauma, infection, an acute iodine load, or parturition. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15056150\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with thyroid storm typically have an exaggeration of the usual symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The classical symptoms of thyroid storm include tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (agitation, delirium, psychosis, stupor, or coma), and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain). Physical examination may reveal goiter, ophthalmopathy (in the presence of Graves' disease), lid lag, hand tremor, and warm and moist skin. Thyroid function tests show hyperthyroidism (suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], elevated free thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) generally comparable with that in patients with uncomplicated overt hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H15056278\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of thyroid storm is based upon the presence of severe and life-threatening symptoms (hyperpyrexia, cardiovascular dysfunction, altered mentation) in a patient with biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism (elevation of free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T3 and suppression of TSH). There are no universally accepted criteria or validated clinical tools for diagnosing thyroid storm. In one scoring system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60908 \">table 1</a>), a score of 45 or more is highly suggestive of thyroid storm, whereas a score below 25 makes thyroid storm unlikely. (See <a href=\"#H13827326\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The therapeutic options for thyroid storm are expanded from those used for uncomplicated hyperthyroidism, with additional drugs typically used, such as glucocorticoids and iodine solution (eg, saturated solution of potassium iodide [SSKI]), and standard drugs are given in higher doses and more frequently. In addition to specific therapy directed against the thyroid, supportive therapy in an intensive care unit (ICU) and recognition and treatment of any precipitating factors is essential since the mortality rate of thyroid storm is substantial (10 to 30 percent). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with clinical features of thyroid storm, we begin immediate treatment with a beta blocker (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> in a dose to achieve adequate control of heart rate, typically 60 to 80 mg orally every four to six hours), a thionamide, and glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>, 100 mg intravenously every eight hours). One hour after a thionamide is given, we administer iodine (SSKI, 5 drops [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">drops/mL,</span> 50 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodide/drop]</span> orally every six hours or Lugol's solution, 10 drops [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">drops/mL,</span> 6.25 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodine/drop]</span> every eight hours). Bile acid sequestrants (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a>, 4 g orally four times daily) may also be of benefit in severe cases to decrease enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormones. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with life-threatening thyroid storm admitted to an ICU, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> (PTU) (200 mg orally every four hours) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). PTU blocks T4-to-T3 conversion and results in lower serum T3 levels for the first several days of treatment. However, for severe, but not life-threatening, hyperthyroidism, methimazole (20 mg every six hours) may be preferred because of its longer half-life, lower risk of hepatic toxicity, and because it ultimately restores euthyroidism more quickly than PTU. Patients initially treated with PTU should be transitioned to methimazole before discharge from the hospital. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Thionamides'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and toxicity of thionamides&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with contraindications to thionamides who require urgent correction of hyperthyroidism, surgery is the treatment of choice. Patients who are to undergo surgery require preoperative treatment of thyrotoxicosis. We typically treat with beta blockers (if not contraindicated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> 60 to 80 mg every four to six hours), glucocorticoids to inhibit conversion of T4 to T3 (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, 1 to 2 mg every six hours), bile acid sequestrants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a> 4 g orally four times daily), and, in patients with Graves' disease, iodine (SSKI, 5 drops [50 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodide/drop]</span> orally every six hours or Lugol's solution, 10 drops [6.25 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodide/iodine</span> per drop] every eight hours). We continue treatment for up to five to seven days. (See <a href=\"#H3999987\" class=\"local\">'Patients unable to take a thionamide'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the clinical manifestations of thyroid storm are improved, long-term therapy is required to prevent a recurrence of severe thyrotoxicosis. For definitive therapy of patients with hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, or toxic adenoma, we suggest radioiodine therapy as our first choice in the absence of moderate to severe Graves' orbitopathy, given its lower cost and lower complication rate than surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Surgery is an option for patients with hyperthyroidism due to a very large or obstructive goiter.
