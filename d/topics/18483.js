It is also possible for two surgical routes to be combined in one operation, such as a laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy or a laparoscopic hysterectomy with a minilaparotomy to remove the uterus. When selecting a route for hysterectomy, the surgeon balances the medical indication, patient profile, risks and benefits, safety, and cost-effectiveness of each surgical approach. As vaginal hysterectomy is among the safest and most cost-effective routes for hysterectomy, it is the first-line approach whenever possible.</p><p>This topic will review the preoperative considerations, procedure, nuances, and complications of vaginal hysterectomy.

Surgeon preference for other operative routes is no longer considered an appropriate reason to avoid the vaginal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While high safety and low cost make vaginal hysterectomy the preferred route, a meta-analysis of seven trials reported similar rates of visceral injury and long term complications among vaginal and laparoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, if vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible, laparoscopic hysterectomy is typically the next alternative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease#H801890425\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;, section on 'Advantages and disadvantages of surgical approaches'</a>.)</p><p>There are no absolute contraindications to vaginal hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Relative anatomic contraindications include malignancy, extremely enlarged uterine size, and significant pelvic adhesions. Patient characteristics that can make a vaginal approach to hysterectomy more challenging include nulliparity, increased body mass index, history of pelvic radiation, and lack of uterine descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There is no specific combination of patient size, uterine size, parity, and prolapse that predicts a successful vaginal hysterectomy, although normal body mass index, smaller uterine size, multiparity, and some degree of uterine laxity are characteristics that generally increase the success of the procedure. However, vaginal hysterectomy can be safely performed in women without these characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In our practice, ease of access to the uterine vessels is most predictive of a successful vaginal surgery. Thus, vaginal hysterectomy can be very challenging, or require abdominal conversion, in a woman with a narrow pelvis and a wide, bulky uterus or a woman with fibroids that block or limit access to the uterine vessels (eg, broad ligament or cervical fibroids). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease#H801890414\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;, section on 'Surgical considerations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease#H801890461\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;, section on 'Factors that influence the route of hysterectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Despite vaginal hysterectomy being the preferred route for hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], there are fewer vaginal hysterectomies performed compared with other routes. Obstacles to performing vaginal hysterectomy include limited training, fewer numbers of hysterectomies being performed by individual surgeons, and greater diversity of operative approaches, which further decreases the number of vaginal surgeries performed in training and in practice. Obesity and prior pelvic surgeries, including Cesarean deliveries, can increase surgical difficulty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Both experience during training and maintenance of proficiency after training is completed are paramount to maintaining surgeon confidence in this approach. We would encourage mentoring, operating with another surgeon to assist with difficult cases (as opposed to a surgical technician or trainee), and pursuing vaginal hysterectomy whenever clinically appropriate as methods to increase utilization of this route. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341328608\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple adjunct issues are addressed by the surgeon when planning a vaginal hysterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17405296\"><span class=\"h2\">Adhesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients at high risk for significant pelvic adhesions (eg, women with prior pelvic surgery; history of inflammatory process such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease; or pelvic radiation), laparoscopy is often performed as a first step to visualize pelvic anatomy and lyse adhesions. The hysterectomy can also be started via the laparoscopic approach; the amount of surgery performed vaginally versus laparoscopically is influenced by the findings at the time of laparoscopy. Alternately, the surgeon can begin operating via the vaginal route and add laparoscopic visualization of the abdominal cavity only if there is difficulty entering the anterior or posterior peritoneum. The latter approach would likely reduce the number of laparoscopies performed as well as the operative time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-hysterectomy#H23593834\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Procedure'</a>.)</p><p>When unanticipated adhesions are discovered after the start of vaginal surgery, the surgeon can still perform laparoscopy to dissect adhesions. If the peritoneum has been opened, a surgical glove or bulb syringe is placed in the vagina to seal the peritoneum and allow insufflation of the abdomen for laparoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71195415\"><span class=\"h2\">Leiomyomata (fibroids)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leiomyomata (fibroids) can increase the complexity of hysterectomy by blocking surgical access to the uterine vessels, particularly when located in the lower uterine segment, cervix, or broad ligament. Preoperative imaging can help delineate the anatomic relationship of the fibroids, uterine fundus, cervix, and broad ligament. If we suspect an anatomic abnormality such as fibroids on examination, our first choice for imaging is transvaginal ultrasound. If the ultrasound study does not adequately delineate the anatomy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide additional detail. However, we do not routinely obtain MRI prior to performing vaginal hysterectomy.</p><p>Management options for enlarged fibroids include preoperative gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy, preoperative uterine artery embolization, or intraoperative fibroid removal. Preoperative GnRH agonist therapy reduces fibroid size and can facilitate vaginal hysterectomy. Typical treatment is three to six months prior to the surgery, which will reduce uterine size by 35 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>Intraoperatively, the fibroids can be hand-cut into multiple pieces for removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79676\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79676 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70385 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56759\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56759 \">figure 3</a>). We prefer to leave fibroids intact if possible because myomectomy can increase bleeding, particularly prior to the ligation of the uterine vessels. If there is a concern for malignant uterine pathology, the uterus is removed intact or in a specimen bag [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Surgeons skilled in intramyometrial coring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56250\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56250 \">figure 4</a>), bivalving techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79676\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79676 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56759\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56759 \">figure 3</a>), or vaginal myomectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70385 \">figure 2</a>) can remove even larger uteri vaginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/3,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11537010\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic organ prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild to moderate uterine prolapse can make vaginal hysterectomy easier because some descent of the uterus improves access to the uterine vessels. However, severe uterine prolapse (Stage III or IV) can make vaginal hysterectomy more challenging because of significant anatomic distortion, particularly at the level of the bladder and ureters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women with severe prolapse, a D&ouml;derlein-Kr&ouml;nig vaginal hysterectomy can be helpful. In this technique, the anterior peritoneum is entered and the uterine fundus is delivered through the incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The hysterectomy is then performed in a manner similar to an open abdominal hysterectomy; the surgery starts with ligation of the round ligaments and progresses to the uterosacral ligaments. The posterior cul-de-sac is opened last. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Operative technique'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63190029\"><span class=\"h2\">Removal of adnexa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Salpingectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy can be performed to remove pathology or to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. Successful vaginal bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without laparoscopic assistance has been reported in 65 to 98 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>] and successful salpingectomy has been reported in 81 to 88 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Therefore, the need for concomitant adnexal surgery is not a reason for choosing an alternate surgical route. </p><p>In one prospective study of 74 women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy with planned salpingectomy, risk factors associated with unsuccessful salpingectomy were prior adnexal surgery (threefold increased risk) and uterine fibroids (nearly sixfold increased risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. If the surgeon is unsuccessful with vaginal removal of the adnexa, a laparoscopic removal can be performed after cuff closure. We counsel women regarding elective salpingectomy and oophorectomy and create a surgical plan as part of preoperative counseling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elective oophorectomy or ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147010067\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic suspension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We typically perform a vaginal suspension at the time of vaginal hysterectomy to reduce risk of future prolapse. The choice of support procedure varies based on the presence of prolapse or symptoms. However, the optimal approach for asymptomatic women with normal pelvic support is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylactic-vaginal-apex-suspension-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylactic vaginal apex suspension at the time of hysterectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Disruption of apical support occurs when the uterosacral and cardinal ligament complexes are divided. This is thought to be one of the major contributors to the subsequent development of the posthysterectomy apical (or vault) prolapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61643\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61643 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. While there is debate over the true risk of prolapse from hysterectomy, the surgical route of hysterectomy does not appear to impact prolapse risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Boot-type stirrups allow the surgeon to change the patient's position intraoperatively but may decrease exposure because of their larger size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107013\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107013 \">figure 8</a>). With all stirrups, protective positioning is required to avoid pressure ulcers, nerve compression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51144\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51144 \">figure 9</a>), and compartment syndrome.

We prefer to tuck the woman&rsquo;s arms at her sides rather than use arm boards to protect them from unintended movement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107012\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107012 \">figure 10</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited patient mobility &ndash; Women with limited range of motion, such as after joint replacement, are positioned while awake to ensure there is no excessive <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">abduction/adduction</span> of the affected joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trendelenburg position &ndash; Use of Trendelenburg position is very helpful for visualizing the utero-ovarian pedicles, performing adnexal surgery or apical suspension procedures, and closing the vaginal cuff.

In the absence of compelling data to guide timing, the decision is the surgeon&rsquo;s preference. Immediate insertion of the bladder catheter decompresses the bladder and limits the bladder&rsquo;s protrusion into the operative field. If a bladder perforation were to occur, we would expect to identify it during cystourethroscopy at the conclusion of the case. (See <a href=\"#H57622704\" class=\"local\">'Cystourethroscopy'</a> above.)</p><p>An alternate approach is to insert the bladder catheter after entry into the anterior cul-de-sac. The rationale is that delay of insertion results in a slightly distended bladder that would leak urine if perforation were to occur during the anterior colpotomy. Of note, this approach does not reduce the incidence of bladder injury but facilitates identification of the injury.

While this is not an essential step, it may preserve vaginal length at the time of closure. Once the incision is made with a scalpel or electrocautery, the surgeon then sharply dissects or bluntly pushes the overlying vaginal epithelium off the underlying cervical stroma with the aid of a surgical sponge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64997\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64997 \">figure 12</a>). Alternately, some surgeons omit the cervical incision and begin the surgery by cutting directly through the posterior vaginal epithelium into the posterior peritoneum. (See <a href=\"#H23165591\" class=\"local\">'Posterior cul-de-sac entry'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior to incision, we inject a vasoconstrictor circumferentially around the cervix for hemostasis and hydrodissection. Some surgeons also inject 10 mL of vasoconstrictor into the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments. We identify the vesicocervical fold prior to injection because the infiltrate can distort the anatomy. Injectable agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>, and saline. We typically use <span class=\"nowrap\">bupivacaine/epinephrine</span> or vasopressin that has been diluted with sterile saline.

If the bowel protrudes into the lower pelvis and posterior cul-de-sac after peritoneal entry, we place the patient in Trendelenburg position to reduce the bowel into the upper abdomen and thus decrease the need for bowel packing. If this maneuver is not adequate to move the bowel out of the operative field, then we pack the bowel into the lateral para-colic gutters with moist radio-opaque sponges, which are included in the operative count. In women with an enlarged uterus, the bowel is often blocked by the uterus and bowel packing is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23165591\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior cul-de-sac entry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial posterior entry may be particularly helpful for women with potential scarring of the anterior cul-de-sac, such as after cesarean delivery.</p><p>We place upward traction on the cervix to expose the posterior cul-de-sac. After the vaginal epithelium is incised, the peritoneum bulges toward the surgeon. Prior to incising the peritoneum, the tissue is palpated for bowel. Once the cul-de-sac is clear, the posterior peritoneum is grasped with a toothed forceps and incised horizontally with Mayo scissors to expose the peritoneal cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66673\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66673 \">figure 14</a>). The peritoneal incision is extended by spreading the Mayo scissors and the short-weighted speculum is replaced with a Steinert speculum. We confirm the Steinert speculum is in the posterior cul-de-sac, over the posterior peritoneum, rather than retroperitoneal. Prior to placing the weighted speculum, some surgeons stitch the peritoneum to the posterior vaginal epithelium with a figure-of-eight suture or a running stitch. This optional suture can provide hemostasis and can be helpful at the time of vaginal cuff closure.</p><p>If difficulty is encountered isolating the posterior peritoneum with the above approach, a midline vertical incision is made to the point at which the posterior cul-de-sac becomes more apparent. The incision now has a &quot;T&quot;-shaped appearance. Once the peritoneal window is visible, then the above steps are followed.</p><p>In trying to identify the retroperitoneal window, the surgeon can erroneously dissect into the cervical stroma and create bleeding. In this situation, the surgeon can either begin the hysterectomy in a retroperitoneal fashion or open the anterior peritoneum. After the anterior peritoneum is opened, the posterior peritoneum is identified by placing a finger or instrument behind the uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23165597\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior cul-de-sac entry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We identify the anterior peritoneal reflection by sharply dissecting toward the anterior cervix with Metzenbaum or curved Mayo scissors at a 45-degree angle. Downward traction on the cervix facilitates dissection. The dissection advances until the anterior peritoneal reflection is seen as a white crescent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51826\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51826 \">figure 15</a>). In a study of 22 surgical patients, the median distance from the cervicovaginal incision to the anterior peritoneal reflection was 3.4 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Palpation of this tissue is commonly described as feeling like &quot;silk sliding on silk.&quot; Once visualized, the peritoneal reflection is grasped with a toothed forceps and incised to enter the anterior cul-de-sac (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81305 \">figure 16</a>). A Heaney or Deaver retractor is placed into this space to elevate and protect the bladder and allow visualization of the abdominal anatomy.</p><p>If the dissection goes too deeply into the cervix, bleeding will occur. A new dissection is begun just cephalad to the erroneous deeper plane by placing the Metzenbaum scissors, closed, at a 90-degree angle and then spreading the tips perpendicular to the cervical stroma. Additionally, a bent uterine sound can be placed through the posterior incision and over the fundus to assist with identification of the anterior peritoneum.</p><p>If the anterior peritoneal reflection cannot be identified, we continue the hysterectomy by placing a retractor in the midline anterior space and elevating the bladder, thus moving the ureters superiorly and laterally. Serial clamping and dissection of the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments can then be performed until the peritoneal reflection is visualized. The clamps are placed on the inferior surface of the ligaments, rather than laterally, to minimize the risk of ureter injury. Prior to placing each clamp, the bladder is bluntly or sharply dissected off the underling cervical stroma until the vesicovaginal space is entered. Once the anterior cul-de-sac is opened, the bladder is elevated with a retractor and the ligament clamping proceeds as usual.</p><p>If the anterior cul-de-sac is scarred, such as from prior cesarean delivery, identification of the vesico-uterine fold can be challenging. One solution is for the surgeon to pass a finger or instrument through the posterior incision, around the fundus, and into the anterior space to identify the vesico-uterine fold. To facilitate this maneuver, the posterior cervix and uterus can be bivalved to the level of the fundus after the uterine vessels have been ligated. Bivalving the uterus allows the fundus to descend further into the vaginal canal and makes the vesico-uterine fold easier to identify and incise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11536535\"><span class=\"h2\">Hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common approach to hysterectomy is the Heaney technique, in which the surgery starts with the uterosacral ligaments and proceeds to the utero-ovarian ligaments. This order is the opposite of abdominal or D&ouml;derlein-Kr&ouml;nig vaginal hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"#H11537010\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic organ prolapse'</a> above.)</p><p>After each clamp placement, we cut the pedicle to leave approximately 0.5 cm of tissue distal to the clamp. A transfixion suture is then placed at the tip of the clamp. We use Heaney transfixion sutures on all the pedicles, but this is surgeon preference. Use of an advanced bipolar vessel-sealing device, either laparoscopic or handheld, can also be used to seal and ligate each pedicle. The cutting blade of the device is positioned in the same manner as described for traditional clamps. While we typically use the traditional technique of clamp and suture-ligation at our institution, both techniques are acceptable as the outcomes are similar. (See <a href=\"#H71195499\" class=\"local\">'Instrument selection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uterosacral ligaments</strong> &ndash; To clamp the uterosacral ligaments, we place the lateral blade of the clamp into the posterior recto-cervical fold and the medial blade on the inner edge of the ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72050\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72050 \">figure 17</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The ligament is clamped on the inferior surface, and not lateral, to minimize the risk of ureteral injury. We double ligate each pedicle and clamp the suture tail laterally to the drape for later use. Gentle traction on this suture will help to identify the most distal pedicle when assessing for hemostasis or when performing a suspension procedure. If a high apical suspension is to be performed and vessel-sealing technology is used, we find it beneficial to take this pedicle with a clamp and suture-ligate. This enables it to be easily identified and incorporated into the apical suspension later in the case.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardinal ligaments</strong> &ndash; The cardinal ligaments are identified, clamped, cut, and suture ligated in a manner similar to that used for the uterosacral ligaments. Continued traction on the cervix aids with the identification of these structures and with hemostasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76778\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76778 \">figure 18</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uterine vessels</strong> &ndash; When clamping the uterine vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54737\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54737 \">figure 19</a>), we incorporate the anterior and posterior leaves of the peritoneum into the clamps to seal off the broad ligament. We start by placing the clamp parallel to the cervix, then grasp both peritoneal surfaces and the vessels, and lastly move the clamp handle laterally as the clamp is closed. When complete, the clamp tip is adjacent and perpendicular to the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55832 \">figure 20</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The function of this movement is to clamp the uterine vessels perpendicular to their insertion, push the ureters laterally, and expose the clamp tip and a triangular portion of tissue beneath the clamp for retrieving the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although a double-clamp technique has been described, a single-clamp technique is adequate and decreases the potential risk of ureteral injury. In the patient with a large uterus, a second pedicle may be necessary to make certain that all branches of the uterine vasculature have been ligated. Back bleeding is limited by placing traction on the uterus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Broad ligaments</strong> &ndash; When clamping the broad ligaments, we place minimal traction on the uterus and the clamp because the broad ligament is primarily peritoneal tissue traversed by blood vessels that can be easily avulsed and bleed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57316\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57316 \">figure 21</a>). Each clamp is placed medial to the prior pedicle and no unclamped gaps of tissue are allowed because they can bleed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Utero-ovarian pedicles</strong> &ndash; We ligate the utero-ovarian ligament-fallopian tube complex twice, first with a suture tie followed by a suture ligature medial to the first tie (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67218\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67218 \">figure 22</a>). A hemostat is placed on the second suture to aid in pedicle identification (should bleeding occur) and to assist with adnexa removal if indicated. A hemostat is not placed on the first tie, as traction on a suture tie risks loosening the tie and causing bleeding. Alternately, a double-clamp technique has been described, but is not necessary and can obstruct the surgeon's view.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women with a small uterus, the surgeon can first deliver the uterine fundus through either peritoneal incision to better expose the utero-ovarian ligaments and facilitate clamp placement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71757 \">figure 23</a>). Uterine delivery is accomplished by placing a tenaculum on the uterine fundus in successive bites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women with a narrow pubic arch, long vagina, or obesity, we find a handheld or laparoscopic vessel-sealing device helpful for cauterizing the vascular pedicles. (See <a href=\"#H71195499\" class=\"local\">'Instrument selection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;, section on 'Advanced electrosurgical devices'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Electrosurgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uterus removal</strong> &ndash; The fundus of a small uterus can be delivered anteriorly or posteriorly prior to ligation of the utero-ovarian ligaments. Once the ligaments are cut, the uterus is pulled gently through the vagina for delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71757 \">figure 23</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80866295\"><span class=\"h2\">Myometrial coring for intraoperative uterine size reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with an enlarged uterus can require intramyometrial coring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56250\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56250 \">figure 4</a>) to deliver the uterus. Requirements for uterine coring or hand morcellation include expectation of benign pathology, ligation of the uterine vasculature, and completed entry into the anterior and posterior cul-de-sacs. For vaginal surgery, size reduction is done with a wedge resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55930\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55930 \">figure 24</a>) or hemisection (also known as bivalve technique) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56759\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56759 \">figure 3</a>). Myomectomy can also be performed to decompress the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70385 \">figure 2</a>). If there is any concern for malignancy, uterine morcellation is either not done, is performed in a containment bag to prevent potential tissue seeding of the abdominal cavity, or is done in such a way as to keep the endometrial cavity intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H71195415\" class=\"local\">'Leiomyomata (fibroids)'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11536542\"><span class=\"h2\">Adnexal evaluation and surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the uterus is removed, the fallopian tubes and ovaries are inspected for abnormalities. An atraumatic clamp such as a Babcock can be helpful to gently guide the ovary into the operative field for inspection. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or salpingectomy is performed as indicated. Hemostasis is confirmed prior to cutting the transfixion suture because the tissue may retract into the abdomen once off tension.</p><p>If the adnexa are not easy to remove in this manner, we have used laparoscopic and handheld electrosurgical vessel-sealing devices transvaginally to complete the surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

If the adnexa appear enlarged and are likely to be difficult to remove through the laparoscopic port sites, the open cuff can be packed with a glove or bulb syringe to provide an air-tight seal. Laparoscopic resection is then performed in the usual fashion, but the adnexa are placed in the posterior cul-de-sac rather than removed through the abdominal port sites. Once completed, the vaginal glove or bulb syringe is removed from the vagina and the adnexa are extracted from the posterior cul-de-sac prior to vaginal cuff closure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;, section on 'Oophorectomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23165645\"><span class=\"h2\">Apical support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform an apical support procedure at the time of vaginal hysterectomy. Choice of procedure varies with degree of prolapse and patient symptoms. Techniques for suspension of the vaginal apex are reviewed separately.

Because blood drains into the upper abdomen when the patient is in Trendelenburg position, we level the operating table prior to final assessment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Electrosurgical hemostasis can be safely used on the peritoneal and vaginal edges; vaginal edges are the most common site of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. We use electrosurgical hemostasis minimally on the pedicles themselves as thermal injury may loosen the stitch or spread to adjacent tissues such as the ureter. If cautery is unsuccessful or inappropriate, we place a running or interrupted suture, depending on the source of bleeding. When placing additional sutures on vascular pedicles, we stitch medially or adjacent to the prior suture to avoid injury to the ureter, which is lateral to the pedicle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cuff closure</strong> &mdash; We close the vaginal cuff with an absorbable suture such as 1-0 or 0 polyglactin braided suture. Closure can be done in an interrupted, running, or running locking fashion and is the surgeon's choice. A running locking stitch may provide more hemostasis for bleeding vaginal edges. Closure can be performed either vertically or horizontally. If there is a concern about vaginal length, vertical closure has been shown to preserve vaginal length more than horizontal closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66835\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66835 \">figure 25</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and thus may decrease risk of subsequent dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vaginal packing is optional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We do not place packing in the vagina following surgery as it does not appear to decrease postoperative bleeding after hysterectomy. Additionally, many women find packing uncomfortable and it may inhibit the ability to void postoperatively. As many women are discharged on day of surgery, avoidance of packing ensures the patient will not be inadvertently discharged with packing in place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery#H181480706\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative patient care issues in female pelvic reconstructive surgery&quot;, section on 'Vaginal packing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder catheter removal</strong> &mdash; We prefer to leave the catheter in place until the patient is ambulatory and then perform a retrograde voiding trial at the time of catheter removal. As many patients go home on the day of the procedure, the backfill voiding trial can be done at any time after the patient is ambulatory. If the patient is staying overnight, removal can be delayed until the following morning. Alternately, the catheter can be removed in the operating room, and a voiding trial is performed in the recovery area.

Additional complications of gynecologic surgery are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of gynecologic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23165768\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive intraoperative bleeding occurs in approximately 2.5 percent of women and typically comes from a loose vascular pedicle or visceral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. General strategies to control hemorrhage are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Management of intraoperative bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>To regain control of a bleeding pedicle, we pack the bowel out of the operative field and use Breisky retractors to gain exposure. Next, we place gentle traction on the distal (uterosacral) and proximal (utero-ovarian) sutures to bring all the vascular pedicles into view. A forceps or Babcock can also be used to gently bring the tissue into the operative field. Once the bleeding area is identified, it can be clamped and ligated. We find a right-angle clamp is helpful. Another option is to use a handheld or laparoscopic vessel-sealing device to achieve hemostasis.</p><p>Pedicles that loosen from the suture or retract into the abdominal cavity can cause intraabdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding. If the pedicle cannot be reclamped vaginally, laparoscopy can be performed to locate and control the pedicle. If there is brisk bleeding, conversion to laparotomy may be necessary, particularly if there is not enough time to close the vaginal cuff and set up laparoscopic equipment. If the only obstacle to laparoscopy is cuff closure, laparoscopy can be performed with an open cuff and sealed vagina. A bulb syringe or surgical glove stuffed with a surgical sponge can be inserted into the vagina to create a seal for gas insufflation of the abdomen. Laparoscopy can then proceed as usual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71196154\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder injuries occur in up to 2 percent of vaginal hysterectomies; concomitant pelvic floor repair does not appear to increase the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/34,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,38-41</a>]. Bladder perforation typically occurs during entry into the anterior cul-de-sac. While there is no consensus regarding the role of routine cystourethroscopy to identify bladder injury during simple hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], we typically perform apical support procedures and therefore perform cystourethroscopy.

If bowel injury occurs, an atraumatic instrument (bowel grasper, Babcock clamp) is placed next to the injury to mark the location and hold the bowel so it does not slip back into the peritoneal cavity. In our practice, we consult the general surgery service to assist with the repair when a bowel injury occurs. Information on repair of bowel injuries is presented separately.

This pack is placed while the remainder of the surgical team is converting the procedure to the abdominal route. Laparoscopic abdominal exploration can be considered if the bleeding is lighter or successfully tamponaded. In situations requiring rapid abdominal access, laparotomy is typically faster.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Significant intra-abdominal adhesions</strong> &ndash; When significant intra-abdominal adhesions are encountered during vaginal surgery, concomitant laparoscopic visualization of the abdominal cavity allows the surgeon to see and then lyse the adhesions. Laparotomy is less commonly used, but can be necessary in some cases. However, in the setting of dense adhesions, entry into the abdomen can also be more challenging with either laparoscopy or laparotomy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal or unusual uterine anatomy</strong> &ndash; Atypical uterine anatomy can result from adhesions, fibroids, prior surgical interventions, or congenital malformations. Anatomic variants that obscure vaginal surgical access to the vascular supply of the uterus can result in need for abdominal conversion to complete the procedure. </p><p/><p>If conversion is necessary, placing a moistened laparotomy sponge or pack, aseptic syringe, pediatric nasal bulb syringe, or a surgical glove filled with a sponge into the vagina can result in adequate seal to allow for laparoscopy insufflation. If conversion to a laparotomy is intended, no additional vaginal preparation is needed, other than ensuring that the bladder is emptied via bladder catheter. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23165786\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common postoperative complications for gynecologic surgery are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

Cuff abscess occurs in approximately 1 percent of women. Abscesses that are visible at the vaginal cuff are typically drained vaginally. Pelvic abscesses that cannot be drained vaginally can be drained by an interventional radiologist.

Vesicovaginal fistula is reported in 0.1 to 0.2 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-hysterectomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Because these women are more likely to have comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea, we request a preoperative anesthesia consult. For very obese women, we discuss the use of Trendelenburg position with the anesthesia team as these women can be difficult to ventilate when in steep Trendelenburg position.

A surgeon's preference for other routes is not a reason to avoid vaginal surgery. (See <a href=\"#H71195079\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no absolute contraindications to vaginal hysterectomy, although malignancy, significantly enlarged uterus, and dense pelvic adhesions are relative contraindications. Nulliparity, increased body mass index, history of pelvic radiation, and lack of uterine descent can make the surgery more challenging but are not contraindications to vaginal hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"#H71195079\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunct issues that are addressed preoperatively include adhesions, leiomyomata (fibroids), enlarged uterine size, pelvic organ prolapse, adnexal surgery, prophylactic apex suspension, and cystourethroscopy. (See <a href=\"#H341328608\" class=\"local\">'Surgical planning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to surgery, we treat women with vaginitis with antibiotics to reduce the incidence of vaginal cuff infection. We evaluate women with pelvic organ prolapse for occult stress urinary incontinence. For obese and frail women, we request preoperative anesthesia consultations and obtain appropriate equipment for positioning and operating. (See <a href=\"#H71194602\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative preparation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H71195245\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal hysterectomy is typically done with an intraperitoneal approach. The order of anterior and posterior incisions varies with patient characteristics and surgical ease. If neither peritoneal space can be opened, a retroperitoneal technique can be used. (See <a href=\"#H23165577\" class=\"local\">'Entry into the abdomen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intramyometrial coring or hand morcellation may be needed to remove uteri that are enlarged by benign processes.

Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or salpingectomy can be performed as indicated. An electrosurgical vessel-sealing device may be useful for securing these pedicles. (See <a href=\"#H11536542\" class=\"local\">'Adnexal evaluation and surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to closure, we perform an apical support procedure as indicated by the patient's symptoms and anatomy.
