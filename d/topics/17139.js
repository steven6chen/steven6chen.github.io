Unintentional weight loss may be associated with decreased quality of life (QOL) and a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, for patients who are already in a catabolic state, the increased metabolic demands associated with anticancer treatment (particularly surgery) further worsen the problem. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and assessment of cancer cachexia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intuitively, it would seem that caloric repletion, by either the enteral or parenteral route, would be the optimal approach to the treatment of cancer-associated weight loss. However, the routine use of nutritional support in patients with incurable cancer is not totally evidence-based. Not all patients with malignancy or cancer treatment-associated weight loss benefit from nutritional support. Furthermore, the routine use of nutritional support in patients with advanced incurable cancer is associated with a higher risk of treatment-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Nevertheless, nutritional support is frequently prescribed for patients with cancer. In fact, malignant disease is the most frequent indication for home <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN), accounting for approximately one-half of all cases in one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>An overview of the general use of both parenteral and <span class=\"nowrap\">enteral/oral</span> nutritional supplementation in cancer patients and detailed discussions of nutritional support related to the perioperative setting, hematopoietic cell transplantation, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, and in patients with advanced incurable cancers are discussed here.

Malnutrition occurs in 40 to 80 percent of cancer patients and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. It is particularly frequent in patients with digestive and upper aerodigestive tract tumors. Malnutrition may be related to an inability to ingest or absorb nutrients because of a problem with the alimentary tract related to the primary disease process (ie, obstructing esophageal tumor) or cancer treatment (ie, combined modality therapy for head and neck cancer, which may cause severe oral mucositis), or the cancer-associated <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> syndrome.

It is important to point out that although several investigators refer to &quot;malnutrition&quot; in cancer patients, the provision of calories is often not the most appropriate response to this situation, as caloric supplementation can lead to complications and no reversal of the clinical picture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590424\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for nutritional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple scores are available for nutritional status evaluation of cancer patients. One simple to use and objective tool is the Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), which has been validated in various clinical settings, including gastrointestinal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The NRI can be calculated as (= 1.519 x serum albumin level <span class=\"nowrap\">[g/L]</span> + 0.417 X current <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/usual</span> weight X 100) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Based on the NRI, patients can be classified as having no malnutrition (NRI &gt;97.5), moderate malnutrition (97.5 &ge; NRI &ge; 83.5), or severe malnutrition (NRI &lt;83.5). </p><p>Additional issues related to screening for nutritional status are addressed in detail elsewhere.

While decisions about nutrition support are relatively easy for malnourished patients who have a potentially curable cancer but are unable to meet their nutrient needs for prolonged periods (eg, because of complete dysphagia or intestinal failure), they are more difficult when nutritional intake is closer to meeting needs, when the likely period of inadequate intake is uncertain, or in situations where the malignancy is treatable but incurable and the patient is unable to take in sufficient nutrients. In these settings, decision-making is more complex, especially given that providing nutrition support is not without risk.</p><p>This lack of consensus as to specific indications for nutritional support in patients with cancer is reflected in the vagueness of available guidelines from expert groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>International guidelines on the nutritional management of patients with cancer from the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), the American Dietetic Association, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and the Dietitians Association of Australia recommend that nutritional intervention be started in malnourished patients or those in whom difficulties with eating are anticipated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United Kingdom (UK), the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that healthcare professionals consider oral nutritional support to improve nutritional intake for people who can swallow safely and who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition (<a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs24&amp;token=fwHRloZmt4plzoo5p2S/dEbSNJ7JQYMiHIlDXaQ8ONgH9caiYty8Lj65pcRQSUOC&amp;TOPIC_ID=2830\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NICE guidelines for nutritional support for adults</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2830\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> suggest consideration of nutritional support, as appropriate, in patients who have an estimated life expectancy of months to years, but not those with a life expectancy measured in weeks to months. </p><p/><p>The evidence to support benefit from either parenteral or <span class=\"nowrap\">enteral/oral</span> nutritional intervention in patients with cancer is limited: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of the literature by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) identified 26 randomized trials of parenteral nutritional support in cancer patients, including 19 in those receiving chemotherapy, three in patients being treated with radiation therapy (RT), and four in those undergoing stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Key observations included the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In 19 trials with 1050 patients, the use of parenteral nutrition did not significantly improve mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In eight trials that included 333 patients where information was available regarding overall complications, there was a statistically significant 40 percent increase in the total complication rate in the treated group.

Although multiple studies have failed to demonstrate a survival benefit from perioperative nutrition support in patients undergoing major cancer surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>], others have documented fewer operative complications and a shorter length of hospital stay in malnourished patients who receive nutritional support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/18,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,36-38</a>]. In general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing major surgery for cancer who have severe malnutrition may derive benefit from nutritional support and, if feasible and safe, delaying surgery to be fed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients clearly benefit more from enteral feeding, whenever possible, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN), as TPN is associated with an increased risk for infectious complications. However, TPN may be justified in a malnourished patient undergoing cancer surgery when enteral nutrition is not a viable option and where there is a strong possibility that a patient may be cured of his or her malignancy or attain a substantial improvement in survival as a result of cancer therapy. Even under these circumstances, the benefits of parenteral nutrition must be counterbalanced by the risks associated with its use. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role for immunonutrition (ie, enteral formulas that are supplemented with L-arginine, RNA nucleotides, and omega-3 fatty acids) is unclear.

The degree of mucositis is related to the particular cytotoxic regimen. Oral intake may be further compromised by the development of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) affecting the alimentary tract. Parenteral nutritional support is commonly administered prophylactically to such patients until they are able to maintain adequate oral nutritional intake, which usually does not occur until the bone marrow recovers.

Treatment was initiated during cytoreductive chemotherapy, and continued for four weeks following transplantation. Compared with controls, patients receiving TPN had significantly better overall and disease-free survival, and a longer time to relapse. This difference occurred despite the fact that 61 percent of control patients eventually started TPN because of a decline in nutritional status.</p><p>In part because this study was performed a number of years ago, many questions regarding nutritional support in the setting of HCT remain unanswered. The care of patients undergoing HCT has undergone marked change over the last 20 years. Hospital stays are shorter, and with other improvements in supportive care (eg, better antiemetics, use of recombinant hematopoietic growth factors, better prophylaxis against GVHD), and the increasing use of autologous transplantation, the appropriate use of TPN in transplant patients is deserving of future trials.</p><p>Other studies have not provided firm support for the routine use of TPN in patients undergoing HCT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 57 patients undergoing HCT were randomly assigned to prophylactic TPN or to an enteral feeding program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. TPN was associated with significantly more days of diuretic use, more frequent hyperglycemic episodes, and more catheter-related complications.

In fact, patients undergoing TPN had a longer median time to resume &gt;85 percent of their caloric requirement (16 versus 10 days), suggesting that the administration of TPN suppressed the return of normal appetite. Furthermore, nutrition-related costs were 2.3-fold greater in the TPN group. Although this study did not examine the issue of whether prophylactic TPN is indicated in patients who receive HCT, it does suggest that after hospital discharge, TPN does not appear to be necessary in all patients.</p><p/><p>One study attempted to define specific subgroups of patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without HCT who were likely to require TPN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In the absence of well-conducted, robust clinical data, it is impossible to provide definitive conclusions on whether gastrostomy feedings or NGT feedings are preferable.

However, decisions need to be undertaken on a case-by-case basis with input from the patient and other members of the healthcare team. </p><p>In uncontrolled studies of patients undergoing combined modality therapy for HNC, prophylactic nutritional support has been associated with increase in body weight, preservation of pretreatment nutritional status, improved QOL, fewer toxicity-related treatment interruptions, and shorter duration of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/66-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-70</a>].

A single randomized trial comparing gastrostomy versus NGT approaches in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for HNC (which closed early for slow accrual with only 33 patients eligible for analysis) concluded that there were no significant differences in complication rates or patient assessment of QOL; gastrostomy feedings were 10 times more costly than NGT feedings, and the duration of gastrostomy tube use was significantly longer (139 versus 66 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p>Additional data are available from two retrospective comparative studies.

Approximately 8 to 20 percent of long-term survivors become gastrostomy tube-dependent.

The major gastrostomy tube-related problems were not leakage, blockage, or discomfort, but interference with family life, intimate relationships, social activities, and hobbies. It should be noted that these data do not prove that poorer QOL in long-term gastrostomy tube patients is necessarily due to the gastrostomy tubes that are present, which could be influenced by the fact that patients with more severe disease (cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complications of cancer treatment) need to have the gastrostomy tubes in place for a longer time.</p><p>For patients who are able to swallow, aggressive oral nutritional support may provide similar benefit to gastrostomy feedings, as illustrated by the following two trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one small trial, patients undergoing RT for HNC were randomly assigned to aggressive oral feeding with nutritional supplements or no additional nutritional support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

It is particularly frequent in patients with digestive and upper aerodigestive tract tumors. Malnutrition is associated with poorer overall survival in various malignancies, as well as reduced benefit from cancer therapy, increased chemotherapy-related toxicity, and poorer quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some cases, malnutrition may be related to an inability to ingest or absorb nutrients because of the primary disease process or its treatment, but in other cases, it is attributable to cancer-associated <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H21016143\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional status and cancer outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Use of the term &quot;malnutrition&quot; does not indicate that the provision of nutrition is the answer to this set of circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional support may improve outcomes in selected cancer patients. However, due to the paucity of evidence demonstrating benefit, the indiscriminate use of enteral or parenteral nutrition in well-nourished or mildly malnourished patients with cancer should be avoided. Oral nutritional interventions might improve some aspects of quality of life in patients with cancer who are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition, but they do not appear to improve survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenteral or enteral nutritional supplementation may be an appropriate option for cancer patients who meet <strong>both</strong> of the following criteria (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications and benefits of nutritional support in cancer patients'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They are either notably malnourished or at risk of becoming so during cancer treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They have a potentially curable disease or look forward to the promise of a long disease-free period after cancer treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the results of available randomized trials, we recommend that adjunctive nutritional therapy for cancer patients be limited to the following circumstances (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Malnourished patients who are undergoing major abdominal surgery (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'The perioperative setting'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During hematopoietic cell transplantation for patients who have severe mucositis or gastrointestinal manifestations of graft versus host disease, when a long period of insufficient oral intake is anticipated (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During combined modality therapy for head and neck cancer (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Head and neck cancer'</a> above) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of nutritional support in patients with localized esophageal cancer who are undergoing concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) followed by surgery is less clear. Although some centers advocate routine placement of a feeding tube in all patients undergoing multimodality treatment, this is not a universal practice. The use of nutritional support in these patients should be decided on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there is controversy as to when parenteral nutritional support is indicated, it may be justified in a malnourished patient undergoing cancer surgery when enteral nutrition is not a viable option and where there is a strong possibility that a patient may be cured of his or her malignancy or attain a substantial improvement in survival as a result of cancer therapy. Even under these circumstances, the benefits of parenteral nutrition must be counterbalanced by the risks associated with its use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of perioperative nutritional support&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is little if any justification for the use of nutritional support in patients with advanced cancer who are terminally ill and who have an estimated life span that is measured in weeks to a few months. We recommend against the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) for most patients in this setting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Among patients with advanced incurable cancers, TPN appears to be justified only if the patient has trouble with nutrition because of intestinal failure (eg, short bowel syndrome or unresectable obstruction) if they otherwise have a prognosis that would likely be measured in term of many months or years.
