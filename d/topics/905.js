Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) must be appropriately sized and adequately secured to avoid extubation or displacement causing a leak of anesthetic gases or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) out of the airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The size and type of ETT should be discussed with the surgeon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>A 6-mm internal diameter (ID), wire-reinforced, flexible ETT is frequently selected for intraoral surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Nasal intubation is routinely required for base of the tongue (BOT) surgery, transoral robotic surgery (TORS), orthognathic surgery, and maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and may be requested by the surgeon for parotidectomy and some dental procedures. A nasal ETT must be appropriately sized to assure adequate depth of tracheal placement to avoid circuit leak, and must be properly secured to prevent pressure against the nasal ala. A 6-mm ID microlaryngeal tube (MLT) is frequently required to facilitate surgical access for TORS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For microlaryngeal surgery, a small-sized ETT (eg, a 5-mm ID MLT) is routinely used. For these cases, the ETT should be moved to the left corner of the patient's mouth to facilitate introduction of surgical instruments. It must be securely taped to the lower jaw to avoid outward displacement of the ETT when the mouth is opened and the neck is extended for laryngeal suspension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Specialized laser-safe and nerve integrity monitor (NIM) ETTs may be used for specific procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Supraglottic airways (SGAs) may be preferred instead of ETTs for many H&amp;N procedures to facilitate smooth emergence from anesthesia.

For these cases, patient movement, motion associated with monitoring devices (eg, blood pressure [BP] cuff inflation), and accidental OR table movements must be avoided. The surgeon should be notified before any action on the part of the anesthesiologist that may interfere with precision surgery. For precision endoscopic procedures (eg, middle ear surgery), we typically place the BP cuff on the patient's side opposite the surgeon, to avoid iatrogenic tremor-induced interference with microdissection.

(See <a href=\"#H548886790\" class=\"local\">'Oxygenation strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>VL should be strongly considered as the primary intubation technique for many of these patients. Repeated attempts at DL should be avoided, and limited to two. (See <a href=\"#H3225704236\" class=\"local\">'Laryngoscopy technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inhalation induction has a high failure rate in patients with complex H&amp;N pathology and should be considered in close cooperation with the surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H3944080309\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous versus inhalation induction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Flexible scope intubation may fail in patients with H&amp;N pathology because of difficulty in identifying the glottis, difficulty passing the scope or endotracheal tube (ETT), and bleeding. The combination of a flexible scope with a VL or optical stylet offers a wide view of the glottis and continuous visualization throughout intubation. (See <a href=\"#H2477245823\" class=\"local\">'Flexible scope intubation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3632263035\" class=\"local\">'Combined intubation techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rigid optical stylets may be used to bypass mobile supraglottic and glottic masses. (See <a href=\"#H2131662681\" class=\"local\">'Optical stylets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Supraglottic airways (SGAs) can be used as primary ventilatory devices for selected patients who undergo H&amp;N surgery, and may also be used for ventilation as a bridge to tracheal intubation. We suggest using a second-generation SGA for these patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2017802377\" class=\"local\">'Supraglottic airways'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If DL or VL fails, the surgeon may be able to intubate using the operative laryngoscope or rigid bronchoscope. (See <a href=\"#H2098046571\" class=\"local\">'Endotracheal intubation by the surgeon'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A tracheostomy may be the primary form of airway management and may be performed awake or after induction of anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H2167049013\" class=\"local\">'Surgical airway'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our preferred technique for anesthesia for H&amp;N procedures is total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and opioid infusions, with processed EEG monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H2805808618\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer opioid infusions as an integral part of the anesthetic technique, with doses stratified according to the surgical stimulus, duration of surgery, and expected degree of postoperative pain. Opioid infusions facilitate maintenance of controlled hypotension, suppress airway reflexes, minimize patient movement without the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), and facilitate smooth emergence from anesthesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108801 \">table 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4239956845\" class=\"local\">'Opioids during maintenance of anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jet ventilation (JV) or apneic intermittent ventilation may be required for a variety of laryngologic procedures. (See <a href=\"#H414288797\" class=\"local\">'Ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer multimodal prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for all patients who undergo H&amp;N procedures. (See <a href=\"#H2933842796\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals for emergence from anesthesia should include a smooth awakening and extubation without coughing, straining, or retching, to avoid venous congestion and bleeding. When indicated, the plan for extubation should be formulated with the surgeon and should reflect the expected risk for postoperative airway complications. (See <a href=\"#H2902469679\" class=\"local\">'Extubation plan'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-head-and-neck-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Heinzer R, Vat S, Marques-Vidal P, et al.
