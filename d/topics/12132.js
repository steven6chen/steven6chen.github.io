In addition, intraocular hemorrhage such as hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber) or vitreous hemorrhage can limit the ability to examine the eye completely for evidence of globe rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71507\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71507 \">picture 7</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In cases of ocular laceration, intraocular contents can plug or tamponade the wound, hiding the extent or depth of an injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59152\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59152 \">picture 5</a>). The presence of uvea (iris, ciliary body, or choroid) prolapsing into or through the wound is diagnostic of an open globe injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59152\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59152 \">picture 5</a>). In cases of injury posterior to the limbus, uveal prolapse may appear as a dark black, blue, or brown structure trapped underneath the conjunctiva. This is in contrast to SCH that typically appears bright red. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p>The iris should be carefully examined before any mydriatic (dilating) drops are placed into the eye. A noncircular, peaked pupil should raise suspicion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59152\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59152 \">picture 5</a>) and iris tissue prolapsing through a cornea or scleral wound is pathognomonic for an open globe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82383 \">picture 3</a>). If an open globe is apparent or strongly suspected then the clinician should not place dilating drops in the eye.</p><p>In addition to careful inspection for obvious injuries, visual acuity and evaluation for a relative afferent pupillary defect are the two most important physical examination findings for the clinician to elicit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-globe-injuries-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Visual acuity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visual acuity should always be checked in each eye separately. Care must be taken to ensure that no pressure is applied to the injured eye while it is covered during vision testing. A standard Snellen acuity chart can be used at a distance of 20 feet. Alternatively, a near card can be used at the distance indicated on the card. Gross visual field deficit may be assessed by direct confrontation.</p><p>If the vision is not adequate to read from an eye chart, the ability to count fingers, detect hand motions, or the presence of light perception versus no light perception should be noted. One should consider that patients over the age of 40 are likely presbyopic and may require the use of reading glasses in order to adequately assess their near vision. Vision assessment varies by the age and developmental capability of the child.

The eye with the afferent defect will paradoxically dilate when exposed to the light because it has previously constricted consensually to the same degree as the unaffected pupil when the fellow eye was illuminated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71937 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Other findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More subtle or partially self-sealing corneal wounds may require the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> dye. This technique is usually reserved for the consulting ophthalmologist. After topical anesthesia drops are placed, a fluorescein dye strip is moistened and applied to the ocular surface. In cases of full-thickness laceration with aqueous flowing from the anterior chamber, a clear stream of fluid parting the yellow fluorescein dye (positive Seidel test) is noted by illumination with a Wood's lamp or blue light from a slit lamp or ophthalmoscope.</p><p>The ophthalmologist will typically assess color vision using color plates, if available. Alternatively, a red object can be used to test for red desaturation. This finding presents as a graying or washed out perception of red color relative to the normal unaffected eye and indicates optic nerve damage.</p><p>A full ophthalmic examination including motility, color vision, IOP, anterior segment, and dilated fundus examination should be performed in the uninvolved eye to provide a basis for comparison, to ensure no traumatic damage from the event to the &quot;good&quot; eye, and to monitor for preexisting pathology in the fellow eye that may be pertinent to future vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Injury to adjacent structures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open globe injuries are commonly associated with traumatic hyphema (anterior chamber bleeding) or orbital fractures.
