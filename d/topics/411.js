They can arise at any body site, but are most common in the extremities, particularly the lower limbs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227086\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.) </p><p>In treating STS of the extremities, the major therapeutic goals are long-term survival, avoidance of a local recurrence, maximizing function, and minimizing morbidity. Surgical resection is the cornerstone of potentially curative treatment. For nearly all patients with extremity sarcomas &gt;5 cm, the addition of radiation therapy (RT) improves local control, and it has also had a significant impact on limb salvage. There are advantages to preoperative (neoadjuvant) as compared with postoperative (adjuvant) administration of RT, and for neoadjuvant therapy utilizing combinations of RT and chemotherapy, particularly for recurrent and large, high-grade primary tumors. These topics are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-and-unresectable-locally-advanced-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Systemic chemotherapy is a routine component of treatment for several sarcomas that occur predominantly in children (eg, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteogenic sarcoma). However, the value of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients undergoing resection of the adult-type localized extremity STS (eg, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma) remains controversial due to the complexity of the group of diagnoses involved.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the use of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of adult-type extremity STS. The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of retroperitoneal STS, rhabdomyosarcoma and the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors, and neoadjuvant combined modality approaches for patients with large, high-grade or recurrent extremity STS are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Most modern treatment plans utilize initial (induction or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy followed by local treatment and additional (adjuvant) chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Rhabdomyosarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma are children.

The rare cases of rhabdomyosarcoma that arise in adults are managed similarly.

Regardless of whether it arises in bone or soft tissue, the tumor is treated in the same multidisciplinary manner in adults as in children. A combination of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (VAC), with alternating cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, is a US standard of care in addition to local therapy; in Europe a somewhat different combination of many of these agents is recommended (vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, etoposide [VIDE]).

Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 61 of 215 patients who had a macroscopically complete resection (28 percent), while the remainder received no adjuvant systemic therapy. Five-year metastasis-free survival was greater for those treated with chemotherapy (60 versus 48 percent), and benefit appeared to be greatest for patients aged 17 or older who had tumors measuring &gt;5 cm (five-year metastasis-free survival 47 versus 27 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the other hand, a lack of long-term benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy was suggested in a report of the combined experience of two major cancer cancers (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC] and MD Anderson) that included 674 consecutive adults undergoing resection of a high-grade, &ge;5 cm extremity STS between 1984 and 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

With a median follow-up of 6.1 years, the effect of chemotherapy appeared to vary over time. During the first year, the HR for disease-specific survival for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was 0.37 (95% CI 0.20-0.69); thereafter, the HR was 1.36 (95% CI 1.02-1.81) and did not vary according to histology or tumor size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Interpretation of retrospective data such as these is hampered because several biases are operative that favor the control arm:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chemotherapy was likely recommended for those patients whose tumors were thought to have the highest risk of recurrence, while those thought to have more favorable outcomes were not offered chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Although none of the differences were statistically significant, there were differences in tumor histology and size between the two groups. In the combined report from MSKCC and MD Anderson, 50 percent of the patients who did not receive chemotherapy had 5 to 10 cm primary tumors, while only 42 percent of those receiving chemotherapy had this relatively favorable tumor size. It is well recognized that the risk of metastasis increases for every centimeter increase in the size of a primary sarcoma. In addition, 21 percent of the control patients had liposarcoma histology compared with 14 percent in the treatment group.</p><p/><p>These data can be interpreted positively or negatively; the negative view is that overall survival was not improved with the use of chemotherapy.

However, the analysis did not include data from the single largest negative trial, which so far has been reported only in abstract form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A preliminary report of a pooled analysis of this trial and another European large trial, both of which tested the value of an anthracycline and ifosfamide-containing regimen, indicated no benefit from adjuvant anthracycline-ifosfamide chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Taken together, despite the most recent positive meta-analysis, it is difficult to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy as a standard practice for all patients with extremity STS. If there is a survival benefit for doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy, it appears to be small, no more than 5 percent absolute increase in survival at 5 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Conversely, the positive meta-analysis from 2008 is arguably the strongest evidence in support of the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. The challenge wrought by treating many different sarcoma subtypes with one particular therapeutic plan has not worked in other cancers, and should be not be expected to apply to what are 50 or more sarcoma subtypes. </p><p>In keeping with the consensus-based guidelines of the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7720\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> and the European Society of Medical Oncology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], which encompass adjuvant chemotherapy as an option for high-risk patients, our present approach is to individualize therapy, taking into consideration the patient's performance status, comorbid factors (including age), site of disease, and histologic subtype (eg, younger patients with synovial sarcoma or the round cell version of myxoid liposarcoma). The potential for benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy must be discussed in the context of expected treatment-related toxicities, including potential sterility in younger people, cardiomyopathy, renal damage, second cancers, and overall impairment of quality of life.</p><p>Even for those patients in whom the decision has been made to administer adjuvant chemotherapy, the optimal regimen is undefined. We prefer five to six cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> (usually 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per cycle in split bolus doses or continuous infusion over three days), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> (9 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> in split doses over three hours per day for three to four days), with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesna</a> [AIM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67985\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67985 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81370 \">table 2</a>)] rather than MAID (mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]) since this permits the administration of maximal doses of the two most active drugs for sarcoma (doxorubicin and ifosfamide), rather than adding myelotoxicity with dacarbazine.

Given the limitations of the available data, with the understanding that microscopic metastatic disease may ultimately require more, rather than fewer, cycles of chemotherapy, we still consider that five or six cycles of chemotherapy represents the preferred approach.
