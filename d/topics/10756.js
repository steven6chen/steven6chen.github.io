Most episodes are brief and do not cause symptoms, esophageal injury, or other complications. Gastroesophageal reflux becomes a disease when it either causes macroscopic damage to the esophagus or causes symptoms.</p><p>This topic will review the initial management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and management of patients with recurrent GERD when treatment is discontinued. Our recommendations are largely consistent with the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Symptoms are considered mild or <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> based on whether they impair quality of life. Symptoms may be intermittent (less than two episodes per week) or frequent (two or more episodes per week).

We recommend an upper endoscopy if the diagnosis of GERD is unclear and to evaluate alarm features or abnormal imaging if not performed within the last three months. Upper endoscopy should also be performed to screen for Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus in patients with risk factors. Patients with GERD should receive empiric acid suppressive therapy, even if additional evaluation with an upper endoscopy is indicated.

(See <a href=\"#H671602654\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults#H82189930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic findings'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with mild and intermittent symptoms (fewer than two episodes per week) and no evidence of erosive esophagitis, we suggest step-up therapy for GERD. The step-up approach involves incrementally increasing the potency of therapy until symptom control is achieved. We make incremental changes in therapy at two- to four-week intervals. In patients who are na&iuml;ve to treatment, we initially recommend lifestyle and dietary modification and, as needed, low-dose histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89545 \">table 1</a>). We suggest concomitant antacids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sodium alginate as needed if symptoms occur less than once a week. For patients with continued symptoms despite these measures, we increase the dose of H2RAs to standard dose, twice daily for a minimum of two weeks. Further increases in the dose of H2RA, prolonging the course of treatment, or switching to another H2RA is unlikely to control symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Therefore, if symptoms of GERD persist, we discontinue H2RAs and initiate once-daily proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at a low dose and then increase to standard doses if required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89545 \">table 1</a>). Once symptoms are controlled, treatment should be continued for at least eight weeks.</p><p>In patients with erosive esophagitis, frequent symptoms (two or more episodes per week), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe symptoms that impair quality of life, we use step-down therapy in order to optimize symptom relief. The step-down approach starts with potent antisecretory agents and then involves incrementally, decreasing the potency of therapy until breakthrough symptoms define the treatment necessary for symptom control. We begin with standard-dose PPI once daily for eight weeks in addition to lifestyle and dietary modification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89545 \">table 1</a>). We subsequently decrease acid suppression to low-dose PPIs and then to H2RAs if patients have mild or intermittent symptoms. We discontinue acid suppression in all asymptomatic patients with the exception of patients with severe erosive esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus, in whom we suggest maintenance PPI therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3513010565\" class=\"local\">'Duration of acid suppression'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients with GERD may be managed with a step-up or step-down approach to therapy. While the optimal strategy is controversial, both have advantages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The step-up approach minimizes the use of PPIs and their associated costs and side effects, whereas step-down therapy provides faster symptom relief.
