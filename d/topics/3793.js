These signs and symptoms occur on maximum evidence-based medical therapy, following insertion of all appropriate devices (eg, cardiac synchronization therapy) and with all reversible causes of HF addressed. These patients frequently experience recurrent hospitalizations.</p><p>Mortality risk increases with each subsequent HF hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The presence of repeated hospitalizations (&ge;2 in six months) or complicated hospitalizations (eg, requiring intensive care unit care or inotropes) can suggest advanced HF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3231247585\"><span class=\"h3\">Dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As HF progresses, patients frequently develop symptoms such as dyspnea, lightheadedness, or fatigue at rest or with minimal exertion that limits exercise capacity. Patients with advanced HF generally exhibit New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III (symptoms with minimal exertion) or IV (symptoms at rest or with any activity) symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>). Since normal exercise capacity varies based on individual factors, such as age and activity level, standard benchmarks for exercise capacity may not be suitable for individual patients. Thus, a patient&rsquo;s report of decline in exercise capacity over time can be most informative in signaling a significant change in exercise capacity. However, exercise limitation that is worrisome for advanced HF includes inability to walk a city block or perform activities of daily living such as bathing or dressing without limiting symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Many patients will progress to have dyspnea at rest, including at night (orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea). Poor functional status is an adverse prognostic indicator in patients with HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictors of survival in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role of objective assessment of exercise tolerance is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H223111128\" class=\"local\">'Exercise testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3991495942\"><span class=\"h3\">Unintentional weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unintentional weight loss sometimes leading to cachexia is a common complication of advanced HF. It is characterized by body wasting, including loss of lean tissue (ie, muscle) and fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While often accompanied by anorexia (loss of appetite), it can occur despite adequate caloric intake, due to <span class=\"nowrap\">catabolic/anabolic</span> imbalances. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3938766444\"><span class=\"h3\">Refractory volume overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with advanced HF often present with refractory volume overload despite escalating doses of diuretics. Volume overload can manifest as pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure. A requirement of very high doses of loop diuretics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> &ge;160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or equivalent, or frequent use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metolazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metolazone</a> is common in advanced HF. Worsening renal function and inadequate diuresis despite escalating doses of diuretics is also frequently observed. Volume assessment in HF is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1379588286\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypotension and signs of inadequate perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On physical examination, patients with low cardiac output may have signs of poor perfusion, including narrowed pulse pressure, cool extremities, hypotension, and mental status changes.</p><p>Although many patients with HF (particularly those with HF with reduced ejection fraction) have low blood pressure as a result of the combined effect of medical therapy and cardiac dysfunction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg) accompanied by symptoms such as lightheadedness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of organ dysfunction (eg, worsening renal function) can be indicative of advanced HF. Low blood pressure has been associated with increased mortality in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In particular, intolerance or the need to cut back doses of neurohormonal antagonists such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers due to symptomatic hypotension is suggestive of poor prognosis and advanced HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1638537204\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial laboratory testing that may reveal signs of advanced HF includes blood tests, a chest radiograph, and an electrocardiogram (ECG).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955066931\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are a multitude of blood tests that have been associated with prognosis in HF, the following are the most common blood test findings in patients with advanced HF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358395265\"><span class=\"h4\">Poor or worsening renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired renal function is defined by a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is most often estimated using serum creatinine concentration. A variety of factors can contribute to a reduction in GFR in patients with HF, including neurohormonal adaptations, reduced renal perfusion, increased renal venous pressure, and right ventricular dysfunction. Both lower GFR and higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been associated with increased mortality in HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/6,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-12</a>]. In addition, worsening renal function, as evidenced by increase in BUN or creatinine over time, is associated with worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Advanced HF is often characterized by worsening renal function, often in response to diuresis for refractory volume overload.

Hyponatremia is associated with worse outcomes in patients with HF. The prognostic significance, pathogenesis, and management of hyponatremia in HF are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2220240173\"><span class=\"h4\">Hypoalbuminemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin &le;3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> is common in HF and associated with worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. It results from a multitude of factors including decreased liver synthesis, increased vascular permeability, increased degradation, and renal and gastrointestinal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1270362120\"><span class=\"h4\">Congestive hepatopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right-sided HF (which often accompanies left-sided HF) can result in hepatic congestion, which is often suggested by abnormal liver biochemical tests. A mild elevation in serum bilirubin (total bilirubin &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> is most common, though serum aminotransferase levels are elevated in a subset of patients. Serum alkaline phosphatase is usually normal or only mildly elevated. Elevated total bilirubin is associated with increased risk of death in HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Increased frequency or new onset atrial (eg, atrial fibrillation) and ventricular (eg, ventricular tachycardia) arrhythmias can contribute to the development of advanced HF symptoms and should be assessed. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2493437186\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the patient with suspected advanced heart failure (HF) includes history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests to help confirm the severity of HF and rule out alternative causes of refractory symptoms. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2519732603\"><span class=\"h2\">When to suspect advanced heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced HF should be suspected when a patient with HF experiences persistent severe symptoms despite optimal evidence-based therapy (pharmacologic therapy plus cardiac resynchronization therapy, as indicated). The vast majority of patients presenting with advanced HF will have a known diagnosis of HF. Over time, many will progress to advanced HF that is refractory to guideline-directed medical therapy. </p><p>Less commonly, a patient may present with symptoms and signs of advanced HF without prior diagnosis of HF. In such cases, the patient should undergo initial stabilization followed by appropriately titrated evidence-based management (particularly for HF with reduced ejection fraction). The diagnosis of advanced HF is not made unless severe symptoms persist on target doses (or maximally tolerated doses) of evidence-based therapy including cardiac resynchronization therapy (as indicated), with adequate time allowed for a therapeutic response.

Abnormal hemodynamics are generally necessary for the diagnosis, although the precise pattern and severity of hemodynamic dysfunction may vary greatly from patient to patient, and abnormal hemodynamics, per se, are not sufficient for the diagnosis of advanced HF. Typically, there is persistently elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &gt;20 mmHg, right atrial pressure &ge;12 mmHg) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased cardiac index (&le;2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> despite optimal medical therapy is concerning for advanced HF. Right heart catheterization is most informative when performed after volume status has been optimized. Pulmonary artery catheterization is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Treatment of the anemia may improve symptoms. Treatment options including blood transfusion, erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and iron supplementation are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Therefore, thyroid function should be assessed and corrected before classifying HF as advanced. The cardiovascular effects of thyroid disorders are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Both OSA and CSA-CSB can impair systolic and diastolic cardiac function, and the presence of either in patients with HF is associated with worse prognosis. Evaluation of patients with HF should include questions about potential sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (eg, snoring, excessive daytime somnolence, or poor sleep quality).

Before assigning a patient a diagnosis of advanced HF, it is important to thoroughly review the patient&rsquo;s current and prior HF therapies to ensure that all evidence-based therapies have been considered. Optimal medical management includes use of target doses (or maximally-tolerated doses when target doses are not tolerated) of evidence-based medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers. Furthermore, if one medication or medication class is not tolerated, alternative agents with similar therapeutic efficacy should have been tried. For example, if a patient does not tolerate ACE inhibitors due to cough, an angiotensin receptor blocker should be initiated as an alternative. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) should be added if indicated. It is also important to ensure that the patient has been given adequate time to respond to therapy (eg, one month after initiation of CRT).

In patients presenting with advanced HF symptoms and renal dysfunction, it is important to distinguish between underlying kidney disease and impaired kidney function due to cardiorenal syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology#H2022657\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiorenal syndrome: Definition, prevalence, diagnosis, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung disease &ndash; Concomitant lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is common in patients with HF, present in up to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-advanced-heart-failure/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Since lung disease and HF can both cause dyspnea, it can be challenging to sort out the relative contribution of each to symptom burden and functional status. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can be helpful in distinguishing cardiac and pulmonary contributions to dyspnea in patients presenting with suspected advanced HF. Adequate treatment of lung disease may improve symptom burden in advanced HF.

The presence of a normal jugular venous pressure on physical examination in a patient with ascites can be helpful in attributing the ascites to a noncardiac cause. However, it is important to recognize that longstanding right HF and elevated central venous pressure can also result in cirrhosis, and advanced HF and cirrhosis may coexist.
