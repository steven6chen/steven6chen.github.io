Cytotoxic adaptive immune responses are diminished, bypassed, or even abrogated, while regulatory adaptive immunity is enhanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. By contrast, innate (natural) immunity remains intact, serving two purposes: one, to continue to provide host defense against infection, and two, to interact with fetal tissues to promote successful placentation and pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/4,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-10</a>].</p><p>An introduction to the immunology of pregnancy and the maternal-fetal interface is presented in this topic review.

Thus, unique features of the cells that comprise this interface must underlie the remarkable ability of the genetically distinct fetal tissue to inhabit the maternal host.</p><p>Not all immunologists studying reproduction agree that maternal immunity is solely antagonistic to trophoblast tissue. Alternative views have been expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], some of which are described below. Indeed, a maternal immune presence in the decidua is essential for successful implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Evidence of the opposite hypothesis (ie, that trophoblasts have offensive mechanisms for killing maternal lymphocytes) is also lacking. It is clear, however, that the placenta is normally protected from the killing functions of maternal cells. This protection may result from synthesis of soluble receptors (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), display of nonfunctional receptors (Fas), and expression of decoy receptors (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL] death domain-containing receptors DcR1 and DcR2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal trophoblast cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal trophoblast cells are the specific cell layer that protects the embryo from those components of the maternal immune system dedicated to destroying foreign tissues. The inner cell mass and resultant embryo are secluded and protected beneath a layer of trophoblastic cells throughout pregnancy.</p><p>Trophoblast cells are derived from the external trophectoderm layer of the blastocyst and develop into the placenta. Precursor trophoblast cells choose one of three developmental pathways (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-development-and-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental development and physiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They may remain quiescent in the villi as a pool of cells for future needs (villous cytotrophoblast cells).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They may proliferate and <span class=\"nowrap\">migrate/invade</span> into the decidua, ultimately forming the chorion membrane (extravillous cytotrophoblast cells).

The mechanisms utilized vary with the state of differentiation and anatomic location of the trophoblast cells. This cell type, which protects the embryo itself as well as certain components of the extraembryonic membranes that are derived from the inner cell mass, such as the amnion membrane, relies upon multiple strategies to avoid detection by potentially cytotoxic maternal immune cells and antibody-mediated cell destruction while influencing the local immune environment that is necessary for successful pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific immune protective mechanisms</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Altered expression of HLA and related molecules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary cellular immune response that develops against transplanted tissue is directed against the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on donor tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In humans, the MHC proteins are called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs).</p><p>The placenta is not a typical transplant, since proteins derived from HLA genes are not expressed codominantly on trophoblast cell membranes, unlike other cell types. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA class I &ndash; Strict regulation of the expression of specific HLA class I molecules in subpopulations of trophoblasts is believed to protect the fetus against maternal immune cells programmed to attack cells expressing foreign (paternal) HLA class I antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The extravillous trophoblasts migrating into the decidua express none of the HLA-A or HLA-B class Ia antigens that are primary stimulators of classical graft rejection and instead display a unique pattern of nonclassical HLA class Ib molecules, with HLA-E, HLA-F, and HLA&ndash;G predominating. The genes encoding HLA-G and HLA&ndash;E antigens have few alleles in comparison with HLA-A and HLA-B.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">HLA-G and HLA-E may dampen an immune response by interacting with leukocyte inhibitory receptors (LIRs) on uterine natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages and with the T cell receptor on CD8+ cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/1,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18-22</a>]. The consequences of these interactions include activation of pathways in NK cells and macrophages that interfere with the killer functions of these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. At the same time, HLA-G may also activate pathways in decidual NK cells, macrophages, and T cells that promote placentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. One mechanism by which HLA-G influences decidual NK cell function is through a process of trogocytosis, in which a lymphocyte transfers plasma membrane fragments containing cell surface molecules from an antigen-presenting cell to its own surface via the immunologic synapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One HLA class Ia antigen, HLA-C, is expressed on extravillous trophoblast and may have important interactions with leukocytes in some mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The <span class=\"nowrap\">Fas/Fas</span> ligand (FasL) pathway for killing of activated T cells via apoptosis, which was first identified for other soluble HLA class I molecules, has also been documented for a soluble isoform of HLA-G [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Antigen-presenting cells expressing either a soluble or membrane-bound form of HLA-G repress T cell alloproliferation via this pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Soluble HLA-G (HLA-G5) has been identified in maternal serum, is biochemically unique among the HLA-G isoforms, and is associated with specific immune modulation and the promotion of a pro-placentation environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to migrating extravillous cells, syncytiotrophoblast forming the outermost layer of the placental villi that is exposed to maternal blood does not express membrane-bound HLA class I antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Syncytiotrophoblast in term placentas lacks HLA class IA mRNA (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and membrane-bound protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/1,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18-22</a>]. However, there is evidence for HLA class IB (HLA-E, HLA-F, and HLA-G) HLA-G5 mRNA and antigens in this continuous cell layer both early and late in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/18-20,32,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20,32,37,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA class II &ndash; The genes that encode potentially dangerous, paternally derived foreign HLA class II HLA-D region molecules are entirely repressed in trophoblast cells. None of the trophoblast subpopulations express HLA class II antigens either in vivo or in vitro. Control over transcription of class II genes may be exerted by silencing of expression of the class II transactivator (CIITA), a transacting factor that is essential for constitutive and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible MHC class II gene transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B7 family &ndash; Members of the B7 family of costimulatory molecules that have both lymphocyte stimulatory and inhibitory functions are expressed on trophoblast cells in human placentas. The B7H1 protein, which has lymphocyte inhibitory properties, is uniquely expressed on syncytiotrophoblast and, therefore, positioned to interfere with activation of lymphocytes circulating in maternal blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IDO &ndash; Trophoblast cells produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which depletes tryptophan by promoting its catabolism. This is believed to inactivate T cells since they require tryptophan. Although IDO is clearly important to survival of the mouse embryo, studies in <span class=\"nowrap\">IDO-/-</span> knockout mice have failed to reveal any impact on pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Evidence is beginning to emerge in support of this potential mechanism in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TNF superfamily &ndash; Apoptosis-inducing members of the TNF supergene family may also have important roles in protecting the placenta and its membranes by inducing apoptosis in potentially cytotoxic T cells. The ligands identified in <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> on human trophoblasts include TNF-alpha, FasL, and TRAIL, as well as a number of less well-characterized TNF superfamily members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/13,14,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,43,44</a>]. Some of these latter ligands, which include B cell-activating factor (BAFF), may positively influence pregnancy host defenses by supporting maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal antibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All of these molecules, which are expressed as both membrane and soluble forms, can kill activated immune cells targeting the trophoblast by transducing an apoptotic signal via specific receptors on activated leukocytes. FasL may be of particular importance since FasL prevents immune cell attack by interacting with leukocyte receptors (eg, Fas) in other organs, such as the eye and the testis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microparticles &ndash; Placental-derived microparticles, such as microvesicles and exosomes that contain an array of placental proteins, mRNA, and microRNAs, are thought to play a role in regulating the maternal immune system during pregnancy. Studies have shown that the trophoblast secretes active FasL via exosomes and microvesicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Some B7 family members, as well as HLA-G, can also be released from the placenta via exosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The release and content of these microparticles are increased <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> altered under certain pathologic conditions, and, as such, they may be involved in the pathogenesis of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. Exosome-mediated transfer of placental-specific microRNAs regulates trophoblast and maternal cell immunity to viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A novel mechanism by which maternal immune cells can signal to the placental unit via exosomes has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Soluble immunomodulators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal immune modulation during pregnancy may also be conferred by the synthesis of immunosuppressive molecules. As examples, the human placenta produces progesterone, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>), and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/1,21,22,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21,22,54,55</a>]. Progesterone may drive placental production of these anti-inflammatory cytokines in placental cells just as it does in lymphocytes. For example, IL-10 appears to stimulate production of HLA-G [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], and this pathway may be important in a common problem of pregnancy, preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Studies using <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-10-/-</span> knockout mice have highlighted the potentially important protective role for this cytokine in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Soluble thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) may also play a role. TSLP secreted by trophoblast cells stimulates decidual dendritic cells (dDCs) to produce IL-10 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. These activated dDCs induce T helper 2 (Th2) differentiation of decidual T cells. Lower levels of TSLP are seen in miscarriage than in normal pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Complement proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trophoblast cells express high levels of the following complement regulatory proteins: CD46 (membrane cofactor protein [MCP]), CD55 (decay accelerating factor [DAF]), and CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis [MIRL]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Complement regulatory proteins are critically important for protecting the extraembryonic tissues from maternal antipaternal cytotoxic antibodies since complement activation leads to opsonization and destruction of the immunologic target (the fetal cells). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulators and receptors of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mothers routinely produce high titers of antibodies to paternally derived HLA and unique trophoblast antigens, such as the unique placental isoform of alkaline phosphatase. Antibody induction of complement-mediated lysis is prevented by high expression of CD46 and DAF in various subpopulations of trophoblast cells.</p><p>Evidence supporting a role for complement proteins in placental immune privilege is provided by genetic deletion experiments. In mice, the absence of the complement regulatory protein derived from Crry gene leads to placental disruption due to complement deposition in the placenta and lysis of cells at the implantation site, followed by a massive inflammatory reaction and fetal demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL IMMUNE ADAPTATION IN THE PREGNANT UTERUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dramatic changes take place in the uterus during pregnancy that also help contribute to immune acceptance of <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> crosstalk with the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/placenta</span> in order to promote a successful pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences in lymphocyte populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first histologically apparent maternal immunologic adjustment to the embryo is a dramatic change in the relative proportions of leukocyte subpopulations in the uterus. The endometrial natural killer (NK) cell population shifts from uterine NK cells to decidual NK cells (CD56<sup>bright</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup>). Invading fetal trophoblasts become admixed with decidual NK cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells that account for approximately 70, 20, and 2 percent, respectively, of all cells in the decidua [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. In addition, the uterine T cell population during pregnancy expands across gestation and is mostly regulatory in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Decidual macrophages may help to prevent some uterine infections in pregnant women. However, some studies suggest that trophoblast-macrophage crosstalk is more important for promoting normal placentation. Decidual macrophages are characterized by an M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotype, and the placenta may promote this via secreted factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Thus, they may play more of a role in maternal-fetal immune tolerance by producing immunosuppressive factors limiting inflammatory responses at the maternal-fetal interface and facilitating vascular remodeling and tissue homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/9,68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,68-70</a>]. Aberrant macrophage activation may play a role in pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/9,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,71</a>]. Macrophages are also present throughout gestation in the placental villi and are known as Hofbauer cells. These fetally derived immune cells also display a M2 phenotype, although they can generate strong inflammatory responses to infectious triggers. Hofbauer cell numbers are also altered in pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and chorioamnionitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>].</p><p>Similarly, the major roles of decidual NK cells may also be unique to pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Although decidual NK cells express a high level of cytotoxic factors, they are unable to form cytotoxic synapses to deliver granule contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>] and instead appear to play a role in trophoblast attraction and invasion, decidual and placental angiogenesis and possibly fetal vasculogenesis, and vascular modifications in the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/70,77-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,77-87</a>]. As with macrophages, alterations in decidual NK cell numbers and activation status may play a role in pregnancy complications, such as immunologic infertility, recurrent spontaneous abortion, and preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/88-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">88-91</a>]. Consequently, there have been efforts targeting NK cells in an attempt to cure infertility and miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].</p><p>The role of decidual dendritic cells (dDCs) is less clear, although mouse studies have demonstrated that these cells are critical for successful implantation and may also be involved in remodeling of the maternal vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/6,94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,94,95</a>]. An alternative view is that dendritic cells may be trapped in the decidua to prevent the exposure of peripheral T cells to fetal antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Preeclampsia is also associated with persistence of decidual basalis macrophages and recruitment of dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>].</p><p>Gamma-delta T cells and a population of double-negative T lymphocytes (CD4<sup>-</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/CD8<sup>-</sup>)</span> have been reported in pregnant uteri [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]. Their roles are unclear, although immunosuppressive gamma-delta T cells may play a role in regulating the maternal immune system to protect the maternal-fetal interface from aggressive immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. It was once thought that CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells in normal pregnancy were eliminated from or prevented from entering the maternal-fetal interface. However, subsequent studies have suggested that there is a population of highly differentiated CD8<sup>+</sup> effector memory T cells within the pregnant decidua. The antigenic target of these cells is still unclear, as is their function and whether they are protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>].</p><p>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg) are also present in the decidua of normal pregnant women, and their presence and expansion during pregnancy are thought to be triggered in both alloantigen-dependent and alloantigen&ndash;independent manners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/5,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,104</a>]. In human co-cultures of HLA-G<sup>+</sup> extravillous trophoblast cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, there is an increase in the number of cells expressing a Treg phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

Selective killing of these Tregs results in fewer antigenic offspring. There are decreased numbers of peripheral blood and decidual Treg cells in women with preeclampsia compared with normal pregnancy subjects.

As an example, progesterone alters the T helper 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(Th1)/T</span> helper 2 (Th2) balance and inhibits production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in both mouse and human macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,119</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Prostaglandin E2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is produced by resident macrophages and decidual cells.

Nonetheless, many still consider human pregnancy to be a Th2 anti-inflammatory condition and that a shift towards Th1 cytokines will lead to abortion or pregnancy complications. As an example, elevated levels of IL-6 in cervicovaginal and amniotic fluid, but not plasma, was associated with spontaneous preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Similarly high levels of proinflammatory IL-1-beta and TNF-alpha in the amniotic fluids are associated with preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">123,124</a>]. While disruption in cytokine profiles during pregnancy may be detrimental, it is important to appreciate that human pregnancy is both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory, depending upon the stage of gestation, rather than focusing on the murine <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2</span> terminology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/4,104,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,104,125</a>]. What is clear is that the appropriate balance of cytokine and chemokine expression at the maternal-fetal interface can govern the immune cell profile and function within the decidua. For example, one study demonstrated in mice that effector T cells cannot accumulate within the decidua, in part because of the epigenetic silencing of key chemokine genes in decidual stromal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. In contrast, the expression of specific cytokines and chemokines by the decidua and placenta are critical for recruitment and maintenance of pro-pregnancy immune cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MATERNAL SYSTEMIC IMMUNE RESPONSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pregnant immune system bears markers of both immune activation and dampening. However, the consensus is that there is no generalized immunosuppression of maternal immune responses in pregnancy. Instead, the opposite is true in that circulating immune cells from pregnant women generally have a higher capacity for cytokine production than those from nonpregnant women. However, selective suppression or modulation may occur. Studies have reported a decrease in proinflammatory capacity with dampening of the response to microbial stimulation, while others have reported more monocyte-derived interleukin (IL)-12 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/128-132\" class=\"abstract_t\">128-132</a>], for example. Thus, it appears that skewing adjusts the maternal response to microbial challenge rather than effecting a global suppression. In addition, the release of placental-derived microparticles may play a key role in systemic maternal immune regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].</p><p>Although multiparous women are excellent sources of antibodies to paternal human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), maternal B lymphocytes specific for paternal HLA are partially deleted during pregnancy. In addition, T lymphocytes specific for paternal HLA are difficult to demonstrate. Results in transgenic mice suggest that pregnancy selectively depresses maternal T cells that recognize paternal H-2 class I histocompatibility antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are at least two mechanisms for overcoming most immune reactions: One is active suppression, and the other is enhanced tolerance. Enhanced tolerance has been clearly demonstrated in normal pregnancy. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are critical mediators of tolerance, become more numerous in pregnancy in response to the introduction of fetal (paternal) antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/134-137\" class=\"abstract_t\">134-137</a>]. These Tregs produce IL-10, which appears to play a role in maintaining pregnancy.

A population of IL-10 producing CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> regulatory B cells expands during normal pregnancy, and their role may be to suppress undesired immune responses from maternal T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNE FACTORS IN EARLY PREGNANCY TERMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As many as 50 percent of potential pregnancies are lost prior to or during implantation, based upon the identification of chorionic gonadotropin (human growth hormone [hCG]) in women.

In contrast, recurrent embryonic losses due to genetic and endocrine abnormalities are well documented, as are miscarriages due to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Implantation and maternal immune rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Programming the uterus for successful implantation of the semiallogeneic pregnancy may occur with the introduction of semen, which contains not only paternal antigen but immunomodulatory factors, such as prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. Subsequently, assuming that the implanted blastocyst is intact and fully competent to develop into a fetus, the embryo should be entirely protected by trophoblasts via the proposed mechanisms previously described. However, in some women in whom the blastocyst is genetically abnormal, exposed paternally derived antigens may be detected, resulting in a graft rejection response. A secondary immune response would be expected to cause early rejection in cases of recurrent spontaneous abortion.</p><p>Alternatively, some mothers with recurrent spontaneous abortions may lack essential components of the networks that provide immunologic protection to the embryos, such as appropriate expression of complement regulatory proteins, apoptosis-inducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members, and human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) or HLA-E. These and other aspects of infertility, such as the impact of endocrine disrupters, such as herbicides and industrial chemicals, are not well defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interruption of pregnancy by a variety of mechanisms is most common during the periimplantation period.

Infection at the maternal-fetal interface may directly activate the trophoblast, decidual stroma, or chorioamniotic membranes to generate either a proinflammatory or proapoptotic response that in turn may lead to a disruption in the normal distribution, phenotype, and function of the decidual immune cells. Similarly, infection may impact the function of gestational tissues and cell types. The pathways leading from infection to preterm labor are not completely understood, although there is increasing evidence to suggest that innate immune receptors, such as Toll-like receptors and Nod-like receptors, may play a pivotal mechanistic role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface/abstract/4,147,148\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,147,148</a>].
