Prevalence estimates suggest there are 40 million infected persons in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Humans are the only natural host. Infection occurs in all socioeconomic groups; transmission is most efficient when people are living in closed, crowded conditions and is common within families. Enterobiasis is observed most frequently among school children aged 5 to 10 years; it is relatively uncommon in children &lt;2 years old.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Life cycle and transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>E. vermicularis </em>has a simple life cycle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57681\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57681 \">figure 1</a>). The cycle begins with egg deposition by gravid adult female worms on the perianal folds. Autoinfection occurs by scratching the perianal area and transferring infective eggs to the mouth with contaminated hands. Person-to-person transmission can occur by eating food touched by contaminated hands or by handling contaminated clothes or bed linens. Infection may also be acquired via contact with environmental surfaces (curtains, carpeting) that are contaminated with eggs. In addition, eggs may become airborne, inhaled, and swallowed.</p><p>Following ingestion, eggs hatch and release larvae in the small intestine. The adult worms establish themselves in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the cecum and appendix. The time interval from ingestion of infective eggs to oviposition by the adult females is about one month. Each female worm can produce 10,000 or more eggs. The life span of the adults is two to three months. Most infected individuals have a few to several hundred adult worms. The worm burden is not distributed evenly among individuals; the one-quarter of the population that is most heavily infected has more than 90 percent of the total worm burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Gravid females migrate through the rectum onto the perianal skin to deposit eggs; this usually occurs at night. The larvae inside the eggs generally mature within four to six hours, resulting in infective eggs. The eggs begin to lose infectivity after one to two days under warm and dry conditions but may survive more than two weeks in cooler, more humid environments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most <em>Enterobius </em>infections are asymptomatic. The most common symptom of enterobiasis is perianal itching, also known as pruritus ani. This is caused by an inflammatory reaction to the presence of adult worms and eggs on the perianal skin and occurs predominantly at night. Scratching leads to lodging of eggs beneath the fingernails, facilitating subsequent autoinfection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> person-to-person transmission. Secondary bacterial infections can result if the excoriation is severe. Nocturnal pruritus can also lead to difficulty sleeping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, the worm burden is so high that abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting develop. Adult pinworms may be found in normal and inflamed appendices following surgical removal, but whether or not they cause appendicitis is still debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Eosinophilic enterocolitis can occur, though peripheral eosinophilia is generally not observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>In addition, adult worms can migrate to extraintestinal sites. Vulvovaginitis has been described, which can increase susceptibility to urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Involvement of other genitourinary sites has been described including salpingitis, oophoritis, cervical granuloma, and peritoneal inflammation. Enterobius infestation of the nasal mucosa has also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enterobiasis can be diagnosed via a pinworm paddle test. This is a clear plastic paddle coated with an adhesive surface on one side that is pressed against several areas of the perianal region. The paddle is then placed onto a glass slide and eggs can be visualized under a microscope. The diagnostic yield is greatest if the test is performed at night or first thing in the morning, prior to bathing.</p><p>Eggs are 50 by 25 micron and are asymmetrically flattened on one side, giving them a characteristic &quot;bean-shaped&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65366\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65366 \">picture 1</a>). Repeat testing may be necessary to increase the sensitivity.</p><p>Female adult worms may also be detected in the perianal area.

In communities where trichuriasis is endemic, infection may be present in more than 90 percent of individuals, but the majority of the total worm burden is generally carried by fewer than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. <em>T. trichiura </em>is frequently observed in association with other geohelminths such as <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em>, since these pathogens thrive under similar conditions.</p><p>Transmission of trichuriasis is associated with poor hygiene. Individuals of all ages can become infected.

In the soil, the eggs embryonate and become infective in 15 to 30 days. After ingestion via food or hands contaminated with soil, the eggs hatch in the small intestine and release larvae that mature into adult worms, which become established in the cecum and ascending colon after two to three months. In heavy infections, worms may also be found in the distal colon and rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The adults measure approximately 4 cm in length. The thin end is embedded in the bowel mucosa and the thick end is visible within the bowel lumen. The females begin to produce eggs 60 to 70 days after infection and shed 3000 to 20,000 eggs per day. The life span of the adults is one to three years.</p><p>Reinfection is common following therapy in endemic areas.
