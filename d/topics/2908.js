This is accomplished with an additional pacemaker lead implanted on the lateral left ventricle via a coronary vein. Among selected patients with heart failure (HF) who are in sinus rhythm, CRT improves cardiac performance, symptoms, and overall survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with HF varies with severity, ranging from 5 percent in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I HF to 40 percent in patients with NYHA class IV HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The use of CRT in patients with AF will be reviewed here. The general use of CRT in patients in sinus rhythm and the rationale for and mechanisms of benefit of CRT are discussed separately.

Evidence supporting this approach in patients with AF or sinus rhythm is discussed below. This clinical setting overlaps with the HF setting since the study population included patients with AV block with systolic dysfunction and HF. (See <a href=\"#H950042802\" class=\"local\">'Patients requiring a pacemaker for AV block'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67829063\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrioventricular node ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AF who have an indication for AV node ablation for the purpose of definitive rate control may avoid the negative effects of dyssynchrony that can be induced by right ventricular pacing by using CRT. This clinical setting overlaps with the HF setting since patients with HF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction may be most likely to benefit from CRT following AV node ablation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Patients who have undergone AV node ablation'</a> below.)</p><p>The most common nonpharmacologic method of ventricular rate control in AF is catheter-based radiofrequency ablation of the AV node <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the His bundle. Because of the invasive nature of the procedure and the associated requirement for permanent pacemaker implantation, this treatment is generally reserved for patients in whom pharmacologic rate control therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated. The majority of well-selected patients for AV node ablation improve hemodynamically following AV junction ablation and standard RV pacing. However, RV pacing causes the RV to contract before the LV (interventricular dyssynchrony), causing the septum to contract before the lateral wall (intraventricular dyssynchrony). Thus, ventricular pacing can induce ventricular dyssynchrony [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], which may impair LV systolic function, reduce functional status, and increase mortality. Patients with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> LV dysfunction appear to be at the highest risk of clinical deterioration with RV pacing. CRT may provide a means of avoiding the negative effects of RV pacing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Nonpharmacologic therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cardiac pacing in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67829083\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AF who have HF may benefit from CRT, though data are more limited than for patients in sinus rhythm. This clinical setting overlaps with the AV node ablation clinical scenario since AV node ablation appears to promote the efficacy of CRT by eliminating native AV conduction, thereby ensuring almost 100 percent biventricular pacing.

The biventricular pacing rates reported by the CRT device may be misleading since these rates include fusion and pseudo-fusion between device pacing and the patient&rsquo;s intrinsic conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Holter monitoring may be required to adequately assess the extent of biventricular pacing in patients with intact AV conduction.</p><p>Many patients who have the above indications for CRT are also candidates for an ICD and should receive a combined device.

In the CARE-HF trial comparing CRT to pharmacologic therapy alone, though mortality was higher among patients who developed new AF during follow-up, patients with new AF benefitted from CRT for all major study end points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the RAFT trial comparing implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to CRT plus ICD (CRT-D), CRT-D provided no benefit compared to ICD alone in the subset of 229 patients with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, less than one-third of CRT patients received &ge;95 percent ventricular pacing during the first six months of followup.

This study included 59 patients with HF and chronic AF with wide QRS complex who required a permanent pacemaker because of a slow ventricular rate; the patients were randomly assigned to either single site RV pacing or biventricular pacing in a crossover fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Sixty-three percent of patients had undergone AV node ablation. Only 39 patients completed the six-month crossover trial, which limits any conclusions that can be drawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in exercise tolerance or peak oxygen consumption. In contrast, when data from the 37 patients who received effective therapy (97 to 100 percent paced cycles) were evaluated, biventricular pacing was associated with a significant increase in six-minute walk distance and peak oxygen consumption.</p><p>A later large observational registry study compared outcomes in patients with HF with QRS duration of &ge;120 ms and LVEF of &le;35 percent receiving CRT (n = 4471) to patients with these characteristics receiving no device therapy (n = 4888) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. CRT-D use was associated with lower risks of mortality and hospital readmission in the study population, and these associations were also seen in the subgroup of 3357 patients with AF. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of AV node ablation in patients with HF and AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with LV dyssynchrony, benefit from CRT requires biventricular pacing to occur most of the time (ie, intrinsic dyssynchronous conduction should be rare). This can be difficult to accomplish in patients with AF if conduction through the AV node is rapid. However, AV node ablation eliminates intrinsic conduction, resulting in ventricular pacing 100 percent of the time.</p><p>The role of AV node ablation in combination with CRT was evaluated in a series of 673 patients receiving a CRT device for conventional indications (LVEF &le;35 percent, NYHA class &ge;II, and a QRS duration &gt;120 msec) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Among the 162 patients in this cohort with chronic AF, 48 were given medical therapy for rate control and 114 underwent AV node ablation. In contrast to the above described studies in which AV node ablation was necessary for rate control, AV node ablation in this study was performed to ensure frequent biventricular pacing (&gt;85 percent of the time).</p><p>At four-year follow-up, the following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with AF and sinus rhythm had similar improvements in LVEF, reverse remodeling, and exercise tolerance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with AF, the benefits of CRT were only seen in those patients who had undergone AV node ablation. Despite biventricular pacing more than 85 percent of the time, patients being treated with medications for rate control showed no improvement in LV function or functional capacity.</p><p/><p>Another observational study suggested that AV node ablation plus CRT may significantly improve survival compared to CRT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among 1285 patients treated with CRT, 243 were in AF. Rate control was achieved by AV node ablation in 188 patients and medical therapy in 55; all patients had at least 85 percent biventricular pacing. During 34-month median follow-up, mortality was significantly lower in patients treated with AV node ablation (4.3 versus 15.2 percent in patients treated with drugs for rate control, adjusted hazard ratio 0.26 for all-cause mortality and 0.15 for HF mortality).</p><p>These results suggest that clinicians following CRT recipients should target complete (100 percent) biventricular pacing for CRT to achieve maximum benefit. A study reporting on 36,935 patients whose CRT devices were followed in a remote monitoring network found that increased percentages of biventricular pacing were associated with significant mortality reduction. The optimal cut-point was 98.4 percent and patients with a biventricular pacing percentage above 99.6 percent experienced up to a 24 percent reduction in mortality risk compared to patients with lesser percentages of CRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This observation has not been confirmed by randomized trials. Until such data are available, the indications for BiV pacing in combination with AV junction ablation are uncertain. This modality may be considered particularly in patients with significant LV dysfunction at baseline and those who deteriorate with RV pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67829247\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed patient population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The APAF trial found that CRT reduced HF-related morbidity in a mixed population of patients with AF.

Limited data are available comparing CRT with or without AV node ablation to other therapies for AF in patients with heart failure (HF).

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Effect of CRT on atrial fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with AF and an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &le;35 percent who require ventricular pacing or otherwise meet CRT criteria <strong>and</strong> in whom atrioventricular (AV) nodal ablation or pharmacologic rate control will allow near 100 percent ventricular pacing with CRT, we suggest CRT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H67829286\" class=\"local\">'Indications for CRT in patients with AF'</a> above.)<br/><br/>&ldquo;Otherwise meets CRT criteria&rdquo; in this context means either a) has left bundle branch block (LBBB) and a QRS duration &ge;120 ms and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II, III, or ambulatory class IV heart failure (HF) symptoms on optimal recommended medical therapy; or b) has a non-LBBB pattern with a QRS duration &ge;150 and NYHA class III or ambulatory class IV HF symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with AV block requiring pacemaker placement: We suggest CRT for patients with NYHA functional class I, II, or III HF who have LVEF &le; 50 percent and AV block (with AF or sinus rhythm) who are expected to require a high percentage of ventricular pacing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H67829286\" class=\"local\">'Indications for CRT in patients with AF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients who are candidates for CRT are also candidates for an ICD and should receive a combined device. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary vein isolation is another potential treatment option in patients with AF and HF. The decision to use pulmonary vein isolation aimed at re-establishing normal sinus rhythm versus CRT with or without AV node ablation should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on several factors, including the institutional success rates with catheter ablation for cure of AF and patient preference. Pulmonary vein isolation may result in better symptom control compared to CRT plus AV node ablation at short-term follow-up, but comparative long-term effects are not known.
