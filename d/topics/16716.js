Typically, the inadequate cerebral nutrient flow is of relatively brief duration (8 to 10 seconds) and, in syncope, is by definition spontaneously self-limited. </p><p>Loss of postural tone is inevitable with loss of consciousness, and consequently syncope usually is associated with collapse, which may trigger injury due to a fall (such as may occur if the person is standing) or other type of accident (eg, if syncope occurs while driving). Recovery from true syncope is usually complete and rapid, with episodes rarely lasting more than a minute or two. Longer periods of real or apparent loss of consciousness suggest that the event is not syncope or is not syncope alone (eg, syncope resulting in a head injury, thereby prolonging the event).</p><p>True syncope itself has many possible causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66884 \">table 1</a>). Syncope, however, is only one of the many potential causes of TLOC. Examples of nonsyncopal causes of TLOC, or apparent TLOC, include seizure disorders, traumatic brain injury (eg, concussion), intoxications, metabolic disturbances, and conversion disorders (eg, psychogenic &quot;pseudosyncope&quot; or &quot;pseudoseizures&quot;). Distinguishing these conditions from true syncope may be challenging, but it is crucial in order to determine appropriate management. In much of the published literature, it is not possible to distinguish true syncope from other TLOC events.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies of syncope will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and management of syncope is discussed in detail separately.

In one of the largest epidemiologic studies that evaluated the incidence and prognosis of syncope, 822 of 7814 men and women (11 percent) who were followed for an average of 17 years as part of the Framingham Heart Study reported an apparent syncopal episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence of syncope increases with age, with a sharp rise after age 70 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82449\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82449 \">figure 1</a>). The increased risk of syncope in older adult patients appears to be due to age- and disease-related abnormalities that impair the ability to respond to physiologic stresses that would ordinarily not cause syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Syncope appears to be slightly more common among women, although data on this vary depending upon the population studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Variation in the reported rates of syncope in different studies is due to varying study populations, definitions of syncope, and diagnostic methods and criteria. Men, however, are more likely than women to have a cardiac cause of syncope&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].</p><p>Syncope is also a common clinical complaint of patients treated in the emergency department and is the source for a significant number of hospital admissions.

Bradycardia resulting from prolonged sinus pauses, high grade atrioventricular (AV) block, or at the termination of an atrial tachyarrhythmia may cause syncope and near-syncope. Similarly, syncope or near-syncope may occur at the onset of an episode of tachycardia in which a fall in cardiac output cannot be adequately compensated for by vascular constriction. Although an arrhythmic etiology for syncope is often suspected clinically, the culprit arrhythmia frequently cannot be diagnosed since most are paroxysmal and infrequent.

Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and some congenital myopathic processes (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) are also prone to have VT presenting with syncope. In addition, an unusual form of VT, torsades de pointes, may cause syncope in patients with either the congenital or acquired form of the long QT syndrome. Ventricular fibrillation is an exceedingly rare cause of syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Syncope occurring at the onset of the arrhythmia correlates with the heart rate, while impaired vasomotor function may be responsible for syncope during an episode, suggesting a role for neurally-mediated (neurocardiogenic) responses rather than a direct result of the tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p/><p>Individuals with underlying heart disease (eg, previous myocardial infarction [MI], valvular heart disease), a channelopathy (eg, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome), HCM, congenital heart disease, or significant vascular disease are at greatest risk for syncope due to a tachyarrhythmia (usually VT). In contrast to patients who have vasovagal or other causes of syncope, an arrhythmic cause of syncope often occurs without warning. This is particularly true of the bradyarrhythmias and, in addition to reporting no warning symptoms, the patient may also suffer an injury with the event. Patients with a tachyarrhythmia may report having palpitations but may also have syncope without warning symptoms.</p><p>An abrupt change in heart rate, as occurs during the initiation of many arrhythmias, can cause TLOC. The blood pressure may precipitously decline, especially in an upright position, causing TLOC if a prompt compensatory vasopressor response (which may be blunted by antihypertensive or heart failure medications) does not occur. Then, over time, with augmentation in sympathetic nervous system activation and elevation of catecholamine levels, vasoconstriction and increased ventricular contractility can help regulate and normalize cerebral blood flow. </p><p>The hemodynamic stability resulting from any arrhythmia is also influenced by other factors including rate, ventricular function or presence of coronary or valvular heart disease, body position, medications, and baroreceptor sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural cardiac or cardiopulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural cardiac or cardiopulmonary diseases that may lead to syncope due to inadequate cardiac output include cardiac valvular disease (particularly aortic stenosis), HCM, atrial myxoma, pulmonary embolus, pulmonary hypertension, pericardial tamponade, acute <span class=\"nowrap\">MI/ischemia,</span> and acute aortic dissection.

Syncope in patients with aortic stenosis is often associated with exertion.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclavian-steal-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclavian steal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclavian-steal-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclavian steal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Upper extremity ischemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNCOPE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the initial evaluation, including history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram are completely nondiagnostic in a patient with syncope, the patient is considered to have syncope with an unexplained diagnosis (ie, syncope of unknown origin), which occurs in approximately one-third of cases and is generally associated with a good prognosis. In such patients, the strategy for subsequent assessment varies according to the severity and frequency of the episodes and the presence or absence of heart disease. The presence of heart disease has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiac cause of syncope, with a sensitivity of 95 percent and a specificity of 45 percent; by contrast, the absence of heart disease excludes a cardiac cause of syncope in 97 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H1812125933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Unexplained diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF NON-SYNCOPAL ATTACKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes that may be confused with syncope include disorders without impairment of consciousness and disorders with partial or complete loss of consciousness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76023 \">table 4</a>). These disorders should be sought and excluded as part of the initial evaluation of the syncopal patient (which includes a thorough history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and selected additional testing on a case by case basis).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Seizures</strong> &ndash; Seizures are the probable cause in 5 to 15 percent of apparent syncopal episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies/abstract/3,11,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,27,28</a>]. They can mimic syncope, especially when the seizure is atypical and not associated with tonic-clonic movements, the seizure is not observed, or a complete history cannot be obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73515 \">table 5</a>). Another potentially confounding factor is that loss of cerebral blood flow due to any cause of syncope can result in a seizure-like state. As an example, the initiation of a rapid ventricular tachycardia may be associated with impaired cerebral blood flow, followed within seconds by tonic-clonic movements. This apparent seizure activity is associated with brain wave slowing, not epileptiform spikes, on the electroencephalogram. One distinguishing feature is that patients with seizures rarely have an abrupt and complete recovery. Instead, the postictal state is characterized by a slow and complete recovery. Other important clues, if present, are loss of <span class=\"nowrap\">bowel/bladder</span> control during a seizure and evidence of soft tissue injury at multiple sites due to tonic-clonic movements during the seizure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures</strong> &ndash; Conversion disorders can mimic syncope or seizures and are termed psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (previously called psychogenic pseudosyncope or psychogenic pseudoseizures, the distinction being whether the patient manifests jerky movements suggesting a seizure to untrained bystanders). These conditions are usually distinguished by having multiple recurrences of apparent collapse, prolonged duration of apparent transient loss of consciousness (often many minutes), absence of physical injury, and absence of evidence pointing toward a cause for syncope or evidence of seizure activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Hypoglycemia and encephalitis can cause coma, stupor, and confusion, but rarely syncope. Although metabolic abnormalities (such as hypoglycemia or hypoxia) infrequently cause syncope, they can cause impaired consciousness that may be difficult to distinguish from syncope. Metabolic abnormalities, anemia, and hypovolemia can be effectively managed by specific therapy to correct these abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2165813546\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Syncope is responsible for between 1 and 3 percent of all emergency department visits, and 1 percent of all hospital admissions. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possible causes of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) resulting in true syncope are generally grouped into four major categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64301\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64301 \">table 6</a>): reflex syncope (neurally-mediated), orthostatic syncope, cardiac arrhythmias, and structural cardiopulmonary disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Causes of syncope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the evaluation of a patient with TLOC in whom syncope is suspected, the clinician must necessarily consider and exclude conditions that mimic <span class=\"nowrap\">TLOC/syncope</span> but are not true syncope. The most common of these conditions are seizures, sleep disturbances, accidental falls, and some psychiatric conditions (eg, conversion reactions resulting in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, previously called psychogenic pseudoseizures).
