However, in this patient, intensive therapy will not reduce the risk of congenital malformations. Fetal organogenesis is nearly complete at seven weeks of gestation. Counseling and planning before pregnancy are essential in women of childbearing age who have diabetes so that conception occurs when the patient is in excellent metabolic control. Unfortunately, this is the exception rather than the rule in diabetic women.</p><p>This patient had access to medical care but did not take advantage of it until she was already pregnant. Diabetic women of childbearing age often have inadequate access to medical care, especially women in certain ethnic groups such as Hispanics and African Americans with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>You refer the patient to an obstetrician with expertise in high-risk pregnancies.
