Acanthosis nigricans, treatment-resistant acne, scalp hair loss, or hyperhidrosis may alternatively be the chief complaint, although these features are not always present (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>). PCOS is primarily characterized by ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The diagnosis of PCOS has life-long implications with increased risk for infertility, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other health implications including possibly cardiovascular disease and endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>Treatment for PCOS in adolescents is primarily directed at the major clinical manifestations, which are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal uterine bleeding &ndash; menstrual irregularity or excessive bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous hyperandrogenism &ndash; primarily hirsutism and persistent acne</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity and insulin resistance</p><p/><p>Several treatment options have been developed for each of these in adults, and some options address more than one symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Few studies focus on treatment of PCOS in adolescents, so management is based primarily on studies in adults. Strategies for managing PCOS and associated symptoms on adolescents are discussed in this topic review.</p><p>Other aspects of PCOS in adolescents are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686220368\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT STRATEGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of therapy for PCOS depends on the individual adolescent's symptoms and her goals and preferences. First-line treatment is ordinarily estrogen-progestin combination oral contraceptive pills (COCs), since these correct both menstrual abnormalities and hyperandrogenemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67829\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67829 \">table 1</a>). If hirsutism is not controlled satisfactorily by cosmetic and COC treatment, physical hair reduction methods and antiandrogen therapy are then added. Lifestyle modification is first-line treatment for overweight and obesity. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is suggested if the abnormal glucose tolerance or lipid abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome cannot be normalized by weight loss. This approach is in agreement with Endocrine Society guidelines for the treatment of PCOS in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Sometimes symptoms demand empiric treatment with COCs that would mask the documentation of the diagnostic criterion of <strong>persistence</strong> of hyperandrogenism and anovulation that is necessary to establish the diagnosis of PCOS in an adolescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. In such cases, pretreatment diagnostic screening should be initiated to the extent possible (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;</a>). In this way, a provisional diagnosis of PCOS can be made. After the patient reaches gynecologic maturity, the diagnosis of PCOS can be confirmed by demonstrating persistence of PCOS manifestations during a trial off COC treatment for a few months. If a trial off of COC is attempted, it should be coupled with contraceptive counseling, because the infertility of PCOS is relative, not absolute.</p><p>The optimal duration of treatment has not been determined. Whereas PCOS ordinarily persists, little is known about the natural history of PCOS diagnosed in adolescence, particularly in mild cases. We advise continuing treatment until the patient is gynecologically mature (five years postmenarcheal) or has lost a substantial amount of excess weight.</p><p>Management of PCOS in adolescents also includes evaluation of first-degree relatives because the hyperandrogenism and metabolic components of the syndrome have familial elements. (See <a href=\"#H20757812\" class=\"local\">'Family evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Goals of treatment include addressing each of the following major symptoms:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49639611\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal uterine bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCOS in adolescents is characterized by anovulatory symptoms, which can manifest as menstrual irregularity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive menstrual bleeding. The thresholds for defining these abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) patterns in adolescents are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93199 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Anovulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h3\">Menstrual irregularity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menstrual irregularity should be treated in adolescents with PCOS not only for psychosocial reasons, but because chronic anovulation increases the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia, which is associated with endometrial carcinoma. Progestin is the critical ingredient in COCs that inhibits endometrial proliferation; it prevents the hyperplasia that results from unopposed estrogen action. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686220506\"><span class=\"h3\">Excessive menstrual bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive irregular menstrual bleeding due to ovulatory dysfunction is a common manifestation of PCOS and often is the initial presenting complaint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93199 \">table 2</a>). Heavy uterine bleeding can cause anemia of a critical degree. COCs or progestin-only regimens are usually effective in managing this symptom. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, clinical features and differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Anovulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686220553\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous hyperandrogenism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over half of PCOS adolescents have hirsutism or acne vulgaris. Medical endocrine therapy is indicated if the response to cosmetic and dermatologic measures is inadequate. The goal of hormonal therapy is to decrease the effect of excess androgens by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing androgen production</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing serum free androgen levels by increasing androgen binding to plasma-binding proteins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blocking androgen action at the level of target organs (eg, hair follicle)</p><p/><p>COCs accomplish the first two of these goals. They lower serum free testosterone levels mainly by decreasing ovarian production via suppression of serum gonadotropin levels, and the estrogenic component increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. They also modestly lower dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate levels. Reducing androgen levels hinders the further transformation of vellus to terminal hairs, which occurs with androgen exposure. In most patients with PCOS, treatment with COCs can be expected to arrest progression of hirsutism, reduce the need for shaving by about half, and improve acne within three months.</p><p>Antiandrogenic therapy, which inhibits binding of androgen to its receptor, is indicated for patients with hirsutism that does not respond sufficiently to COC treatment and physical measures. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Antiandrogens'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686220580\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity and insulin resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin-resistant hyperinsulinism is an important factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS and its complications. Treatments that reduce insulin resistance improve ovulation moderately and hyperandrogenemia slightly. Obesity is an important contributor to the insulin resistance of PCOS, although the insulin resistance is disproportionate to the degree of adiposity. Insulin resistance is commonly manifested as acanthosis nigricans and metabolic syndrome, although it may exist in the absence of these clinical findings. Diet and exercise are first-line treatment to address obesity in adolescents with PCOS. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is appropriate for patients with impaired glucose tolerance, usually as an adjunct to COCs. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Obesity and insulin resistance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686220589\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal treatment with estrogen-progestin contraceptives is ordinarily the first-line approach for management of PCOS, in combination with weight management for patients with obesity. Additional strategies can be offered to patients with cutaneous hyperandrogenism or abnormal glucose tolerance that is not adequately controlled by these hormonal treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67829\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67829 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hirsutism'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Insulin resistance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination oral contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>COCs, which contain estrogen and progestin, usually are the first-line treatment for adolescents with PCOS and abnormal menstrual bleeding or cutaneous signs of androgen excess. The estrogen-progestin combination suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and reduces excess androgen production by the ovary, which improves menstrual irregularity, excessive anovulatory uterine bleeding, hirsutism, and acne. The progestin component also inhibits endometrial proliferation, preventing hyperplasia and the associated risk of carcinoma. COCs are packaged such that the active ingredients are ordinarily taken once daily for 21 successive days, and withdrawal bleeding is expected during the following week when inert ingredients are taken as a spacer. COCs regulate menstrual periods with a higher degree of reliability than other forms of treatment. Endocrine Society guidelines suggest COCs as first-line pharmacologic therapy of menstrual irregularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In general, we suggest selecting an COC that contains at least 30 &micro;g ethinyl estradiol. This is because COCs containing &le;20 &micro;g ethinyl estradiol, though posing little cardiovascular risk, may inadequately promote normal accrual of bone mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and may be less effective in controlling irregular menstrual bleeding, particularly in obese hyperandrogenic girls, than those containing 30 to 35 &micro;g ethinyl estradiol.</p><p>COCs may carry a more deleterious metabolic risk profile in obese women with PCOS than those without PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. For this reason, we ordinarily use an COC that has a progestin with antiandrogenic or minimal androgenic activity, as illustrated in the list below. However, consistent clinically significant differences in metabolic effects have not been found among commonly used COCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. All COCs are efficacious for treating hirsutism and acne. These effects are primarily due to the estrogen component, and any differences in the androgenicity of the progestin are minimal at these doses. Those listed below may be the most advantageous. The choice of agent depends mainly upon the clinical manifestation(s) of the individual patient, and <span class=\"nowrap\">cost/insurance</span> considerations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Available preparations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drospirenone, a progestational analogue of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid properties, is combined with ethinyl estradiol: 20 mcg for <span class=\"nowrap\">24/28</span> days (in Yaz) or 30 mcg for <span class=\"nowrap\">21/28</span> days (in Yasmin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Its unique properties seem particularly well-suited for patients with PCOS because its natriuretic effect minimizes the fluid retention that occurs with other COCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Drospirenone-containing COCs have about a 50 percent higher risk of venous thromboembolism than norgestimate-containing COCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110726 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Norgestimate is a potent progestin with marginal androgenic effect and is combined with ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg (as in Ortho-Cyclen or Ortho-Tri-Cyclen). There is variable absorption of this medication. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this combination for the treatment of acne, along with combinations containing drospirenone (Yaz, above) and the more androgenic progestin norethisterone (Estrostep) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A double-blind study of facial acne reported that a drospirenone COC (Yasmin) was slightly superior to a norgestimate COC for the reduction of total lesions but not of inflammatory lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ethynodiol diacetate (1 mg), a weakly androgenic norethisterone precursor progestin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], is available with ethinyl estradiol 35 or 50 mcg (in Zovia <span class=\"nowrap\">1/35-28</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">1/50-28,</span> respectively). The <span class=\"nowrap\">1/50</span> preparation is useful for patients who require a large dose of estrogen, such as those with obesity or heavy uterine bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; after control is achieved, maintenance should be attempted at the lower estrogen dose.</p><p/><p>Menstrual abnormalities usually can be controlled within one to two months of starting COC treatment, in our experience. COC therapy will normalize androgen levels within 18 to 21 days. We suggest rechecking serum free testosterone late in the third cycle of COC treatment. Because of escape from ovarian suppression during the pill-free interval, exceptional patients require an extended cycle COC to control severe hyperandrogenemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. If treatment is not successful in reducing androgen levels, the patient either has an unusually prominent component of functional adrenal hyperandrogenism to the PCOS, or the diagnosis of PCOS should be questioned. For such patients, we suggest referral to an endocrinologist for further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H768363709\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Further endocrine evaluation for rare disorders mimicking PCOS'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding is similar in adolescents with or without PCOS. The estrogen doses required to treat excessive abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) may be three- to fourfold higher than the doses needed to treat irregular menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Once active bleeding is controlled, therapy with cyclic COC or progestin should be started to prevent recurrence of AUB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After one to several years of treatment with COCs, we suggest withholding treatment for a few months to allow recovery of suppression of pituitary-gonadal function and to ascertain whether the menstrual abnormality is persistent. In doing so, however, one must provide contraceptive counseling since patients with PCOS may conceive despite their tendency for anovulatory cycles and relative infertility.</p><p>Gynecologic referral is indicated for patients who have uncontrollable menstrual irregularity despite COC therapy or whose bleeding cannot be controlled medically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of COCs in the management of PCOS in adolescents may be limited for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, COCs carry about a fourfold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with patients who are not using COCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110726 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. The risk is primarily related to a) the dose and duration of estrogen use and b) use of recent-generation progestins (eg, drospirenone, desogestrel), which confer about a 50 to 100 percent independent risk over first generation progestins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110726 \">table 3</a>). This risk is less than that of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. PCOS and obesity independently appear to pose a slightly increased risk for VTE; while population studies are unclear as to whether COCs further increase this risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], a desogestrel-containing COC has been reported to significantly increase thrombin generation, a VTE risk factor, in PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H342300742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Venous thromboembolism'</a>). For most women with PCOS, the benefits of oral contraceptives outweigh the potential risks of venous thromboembolism. A detailed discussion of the risks and side effects of COCs is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, COCs containing 30 to 40 mcg ethinyl estradiol carry a small increased risk (about 1.5 to 2.0-fold) of thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction in 15- to 49-year old women, compared with those who are not taking COCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The overall risks of these disorders in this population are low, approximately 20 and 10 events per 100,000 person years, respectively. This risk is not influenced by type of progestin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In perimenarcheal girls with short stature for whom growth potential is important, the risk of growth inhibition by the COC estrogen must be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estrogen promotes salt and water retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

However, this hypothetical concern is based on observations in other patient groups undergoing treatment with high-dose estrogens during adolescence. Most post-pill amenorrhea is thought to reflect the presence of an undiagnosed preexisting condition, such as PCOS, or hyperprolactinemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Progestin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menstrual irregularities in sexually mature adolescents often can be controlled with cyclic progestin alone. Cyclic progestin is particularly useful in younger patients with menstrual irregularity but without clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism, before the diagnosis of PCOS can be established. It is also useful when there are contraindications to estrogen-containing COCs.</p><p>Cyclic treatment with oral progestins relies on their direct inhibitory effects on endometrial proliferation. Unlike COCs, cyclic therapy with oral progestins is not effective in treating hirsutism: transient reduction in androgen levels is achieved, but this is variable and generally insufficient to expect improvement in hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Anovulatory menstrual flow can be expected to cease during progestin administration, and withdrawal bleeding can be expected to occur within a few days of cessation of the course of progestin administration. Progesterone itself confers no risk for cardiovascular disease or breast cancer and may lessen the small estrogen-related increase in risk in premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

The choice of therapy depends on the individual adolescent's symptoms, her goal for treatment, and preferences (eg, cost).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the use of combination oral contraceptives (COCs) as first-line treatment for adolescents who suffer the menstrual and cutaneous symptoms of PCOS, rather than other therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The progestin component inhibits endometrial proliferation, preventing hyperplasia and the associated risk of carcinoma. The estrogen component reduces excess androgen, which corrects menstrual abnormalities promptly and improves hirsutism and acne. An effect of COCs on hirsutism can be seen after three to six months of therapy. We prefer the use of an COC that has antiandrogenic or minimal androgenic activity. As a general rule, COCs should be continued until the patient is gynecologically mature (five years postmenarcheal) or has lost a substantial amount of excess weight. At this time, a trial off therapy is reasonable to document the persistence of the syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Combination oral contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the adolescent patient is unable or unwilling to take COCs, the main other therapeutic option for menstrual irregularities is progestin. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Progestin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H686220934\" class=\"local\">'Other androgen-reducing therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with substantial hirsutism who have an unsatisfactory response to initial treatment by cosmetic measures (such as shaving, bleaching, depilatory agents) in combination with COCs, we suggest either physical hair reduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiandrogen therapy. The decision among these options involves patient preference, including cost of the measure, tolerance of <span class=\"nowrap\">discomfort/pain,</span> risk of complications, and outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who choose physical hair reduction, the choice of technique is dependent on the extensiveness of the area affected by hirsutism and patient preference, and includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eflornithine-united-states-availability-of-intravenous-preparation-limited-to-cdc-and-who-distribution-programs-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eflornithine</a> hydrochloride cream, electrolysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laser therapy.

Spironolactone should only be used in combination with COCs because of potential teratogenic effects. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyproterone acetate</a> is a reasonable alternative, where available. The effects of hormone treatments on hirsutism are maximal after 9 to 12 months of therapy.
