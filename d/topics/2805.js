The disorder is characterized by inflammation in the setting of <em>Candida</em> species. Treatment is indicated for the relief of symptoms.</p><p>This topic will discuss the treatment of uncomplicated, complicated, and recurrent candida vulvovaginitis. Related topics on the clinical presentation and diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis and the general approach to the woman with vaginitis are presented separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-vulvovaginitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida vulvovaginitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555122149\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is indicated for relief of symptoms. Ten to 20 percent of reproductive-age women who harbor <em>Candida</em> species are asymptomatic; these women do not require therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3845569014\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment regimen is based on whether the woman has an uncomplicated infection (90 percent of patients) or complicated infection (10 percent of patients). Criteria are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62038\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62038 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1251775618\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral versus topical treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of oral and topical preparations, many available over the counter and in single-dose regimens, is available for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71686\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71686 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In randomized trials, oral and topical antimycotic drugs achieved comparable clinical cure rates, which are in excess of 90 percent; short-term mycologic cure is slightly lower (70 to 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Studies that have assessed patient preference consistently reported a preference for the convenience of oral treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, topical treatments have fewer side effects (eg, possible local burning or irritation), while oral medication may cause gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, rash, and transient liver function abnormalities. In addition, oral medications take a day or two longer than topical therapy to relieve symptoms. The absence of superiority of any formulation, agent, or route of administration suggests that cost, patient preference, and contraindications are the major considerations in the decision to prescribe an antifungal for oral or topical administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>If topical therapy is chosen, vulvar treatment alone is not adequate to eradicate the vaginal reservoir of organisms, even in women whose main symptoms are vulvar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While vulvar treatment can improve vulvar symptoms, vaginal therapy is necessary to fully treat the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347147711\"><span class=\"h2\">Uncomplicated infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2887505999\"><span class=\"h3\">Criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Criteria for uncomplicated infection include <strong>all</strong> of the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62038\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62038 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sporadic, infrequent episodes (&le;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">episodes/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild to moderate <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Probable infection with <em>Candida</em> <em>albicans</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthy, nonpregnant woman</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunocompetent woman</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H881989839\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest use of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, given that most women consider oral drugs more convenient than those applied intravaginally. Fluconazole maintains therapeutic concentrations in vaginal secretions for at least 72 hours after the ingestion of a single 150 mg tablet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Side effects of single-dose fluconazole (150 mg) tend to be mild and infrequent. However, although fluconazole interacts with multiple drugs, interactions are rare at the dosage used to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis. Since fluconazole is now available in a generic form, a single-dose regimen of fluconazole is less expensive than over-the-counter topical antifungals.</p><p>Azole resistance is rarely reported for vaginitis caused by <em>C. albicans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, in vitro susceptibility tests are typically not indicated unless compliant patients with a culture-proven diagnosis have no response to adequate therapy.</p><p>Uncomplicated infections usually respond to treatment within a couple of days. There is no medical contraindication to sexual intercourse during treatment, but it may be uncomfortable until inflammation improves. Treatment of sexual partners is not indicated.

It is unknown whether one route is more effective than the other, as comparative trials of topical versus oral treatment of complicated infection have not been performed.</p><p>Given the convenience of oral therapy, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (150 mg orally) for two to three sequential doses 72 hours apart for treatment of complicated infections, depending on the severity of the infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50932\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50932 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The efficacy of this approach was supported by a trial that randomly assigned 556 women with severe or recurrent candidiasis to therapy with a single dose of fluconazole (150 mg) or two sequential doses given three days apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Severity of disease was based upon a scoring system involving degree of pruritus and physical signs (erythema, edema, <span class=\"nowrap\">excoriation/fissure</span> formation). The two-dose regimen resulted in significantly higher clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">cure/improvement</span> rates at evaluation on day 14 (94 versus 85 percent) and day 35 (80 versus 67 percent) in women with severe, but not recurrent, disease. However, the response to therapy was lower in the 8 percent of women infected with nonalbicans <em>Candida</em>.</p><p>If the patient prefers topical therapy, observational series report that complicated patients require 7 to 14 days of topical azole therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clotrimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clotrimazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">miconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terconazole</a>) rather than a one- to three-day course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. </p><p>For severe <em>Candida</em> vulvar inflammation (vulvitis), low-potency topical corticosteroids (eg, clotrimazole-betamethasone or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-and-triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin-triamcinolone</a>) can be applied to the vulva for 48 hours until the antifungals exert their effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1220949165\"><span class=\"h3\">Candida glabrata</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. glabrata</em> has low vaginal virulence and rarely causes symptoms, even when identified by culture. Every effort should be made to exclude other coexistent causes of symptoms and only then treat for <em>C. glabrata</em> vaginitis. Treatment failure with azoles is common (around 50 percent) in patients with <em>C. glabrata </em>vaginitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Moderate success (65 to 70 percent) in women infected with this organism can be achieved with intravaginal boric acid (600 mg capsule once daily at night for two weeks) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50932\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50932 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Better results (&gt;90 percent cure) have been achieved with intravaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> cream or amphotericin B cream 4 to 10% (5 g nightly for two weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Neither boric acid capsules nor flucytosine or amphotericin B cream is available commercially and must be made by a compounding pharmacy. <strong>Boric acid capsules can be fatal if swallowed</strong>.</p><p>There are no good data regarding use of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> for <em>C. glabrata</em> vaginitis, and it should not be used to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis. Anecdotal reports suggest poor response, rare cures, and the potential for toxicity.</p><p>Although there are also no good data on the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin</a>, which is available as a pessary in some parts of the world, anecdotally, many clinicians consider nystatin the drug of choice for <em>C. glabrata</em>. One or two pessaries of 100,000 units nystatin are inserted into the vagina nightly for 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alternatively, a suppository can be prepared by a compounding pharmacy. Potential side effects include burning, redness, and irritation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120118866\"><span class=\"h3\">Candida krusei</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. krusei</em> is usually resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> but is highly susceptible to topical azole creams and suppositories, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clotrimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clotrimazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">miconazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terconazole</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50932\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50932 \">table 3</a>). We treat for 7 to 14 days. It is also likely to respond to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> (itraconazole 200 mg twice daily for 7 to 14 days or ketoconazole 400 mg daily for 7 to 14 days), but these oral agents have variable toxicity, so topical therapy is advised for first-line therapy. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity secondary to ketoconazole therapy is a concern but rare in this setting. In vitro susceptibility testing is indicated in compliant patients with culture-proven diagnosis of <em>C. krusei</em> and no response to a conventional course of one of these nonfluconazole therapies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1544249314\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For pregnant women with symptomatic <em>Candida</em> vulvovaginitis, we suggest application of a topical imidazole (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clotrimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clotrimazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">miconazole</a>) vaginally for seven days rather than treatment with an oral azole because of potential risks with oral azole therapy in pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50932\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50932 \">table 3</a>). Treatment of pregnant women is primarily indicated for relief of symptoms; vaginal candidiasis is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This approach is consistent with statements from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/12,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17,18</a>].</p><p>During pregnancy, we avoid oral azole therapy, particularly during the first trimester, because its impact on miscarriage risk is unclear, and high doses appear to increase the risk of birth defects. Since topical therapy is an effective alternative to oral dosing, we prefer vaginal treatment until more data are available to support the safety of low-dose oral treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miscarriage &ndash; A cohort study of over 3300 women who received 150 to 300 mg oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> between 7 and 22 weeks of pregnancy reported an approximately 50 percent increased risk of miscarriage in exposed women compared with either unexposed women or women treated with vaginal azole therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Stillbirth risk did not differ among the groups, although stillbirth was a relatively rare outcome. This study contrasts with two prior cohort studies totaling just over 1500 women that did not report an association between oral fluconazole and miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. As the larger study may have had greater power to detect an increase in miscarriage risk, we prefer to avoid oral azole therapy until more data are available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth defects &ndash; Case reports have described a pattern of birth defects (abnormalities of cranium, face, bones, and heart) after first-trimester exposure to high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> therapy (400 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The magnitude of the teratogenic risk is unknown. Further, the impact of low-dose fluconazole exposure is unclear. A United States case-control study including over 31,000 mothers of children with birth defects reported an association with first-trimester fluconazole use and cleft lip with cleft palate and d-transposition of the great arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Limitations of this study included that fluconazole use was assessed by self-report and that the total number of cases for each abnormality were small (six cleft lip with palate and three d-transposition of the great arteries), which makes the finding less certain. Multiple smaller epidemiologic studies have not reported an increased risk of birth defects after first-trimester use of a single low dose of fluconazole 150 mg to treat vaginal yeast infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/20,21,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,25-29</a>]. In the largest study, which included 7352 pregnancies, there was no overall risk of embryopathy associated with exposure to cumulative fluconazole doses of 150, 300, or 350 to 6000 mg during the first trimester nor with exposure to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Overall, these data appear reassuring for women who took low-dose fluconazole before realizing that they were pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], although an increased risk of specific anomalies cannot be definitively excluded.</p><p/><p>Although treatment of vaginal <em>Candida</em> colonization in healthy pregnant women is unnecessary, in Germany, treatment is recommended in the third trimester because the rate of oral thrush and diaper dermatitis in mature healthy newborns is significantly reduced by maternal treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>There is less information about the pregnancy safety profile of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terconazole</a>, a triazole, than for imidazoles. Vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin</a> is another option for treatment. As discussed above, a pessary is available in some parts of the world. One or two pessaries of 100,000 units nystatin are inserted into the vagina nightly for 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alternatively, a suppository can be prepared by a compounding pharmacy. Potential side effects include burning, redness, and irritation. We do not use boric acid in pregnant women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154650914\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT VULVOVAGINAL CANDIDIASIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3747047094\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition and testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is defined as four or more episodes of symptomatic infection within one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/12,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,32</a>]. Vaginal cultures should always be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and identify less common <em>Candida</em> species, if present. As discussed above, recurrent disease is usually due to relapse from a persistent vaginal reservoir of organisms or endogenous reinfection with identical strains of susceptible <em>C. albicans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]; however, rarely, a new strain of <em>Candida</em> is responsible for the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6481898\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimating the incidence and prevalence of RVVC is challenging because the symptoms are not exclusive to <em>Candida </em>infection, many women self-treat, and treatment is often empiric. In an internet survey study of over 7000 women across seven countries, the estimated probability of RVVC by age 50 ranged from 14 to 28 percent, with a mean of 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Longitudinal DNA-typing studies suggest that, in most women, recurrent disease is due to relapse from a persistent vaginal reservoir of organisms or endogenous reinfection with the identical strain of susceptible <em>C. albicans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35</a>]. Rarely, infection is due to a different <em>Candida</em> species. Risk factors are apparent in only a minority of women with recurrent disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-vulvovaginitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida vulvovaginitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Most women with RVVC are otherwise healthy, and RVVC is idiopathic in its origin. Evidence has accumulated linking or defining an association of recurrent episodes of symptomatic infection with vaginal mucosal immune hyper-reactivity to the fungus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This suggests the occurrence of dysregulated immune reactivity in the pathogenesis of RVVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Vaginal hyper-reactivity involves interleukin-22 (IL-22)-, IL-10-, and IL-17-producing regulatory T cells. The role of IL-17 in protection against mucosal <em>Candida</em> infections has been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. IL-17 plays a role in controlling <em>C. albicans</em> infection as it induces vaginal epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides. Studies in women with mucocutaneous candidiasis and RVVC have confirmed the genetic basis for these infections. Different mutations and polymorphisms in innate immune genes alter the vaginal mucosal immune response against <em>Candida</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis has also been associated with decreased in vivo concentration of mannose binding lectin (MBL) and increased concentration of IL-4. Two specific gene polymorphisms, variants in the MBL and IL-4 alleles, can account for this finding in some women. The prevalence of a variant MLB gene is higher in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis than in controls without candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Since the direct interaction of MBL with <em>C. albicans </em>is an important component of the host's ability to resist candidiasis, impairment of this interaction in MBL-deficient individuals, such as those with certain MBL polymorphisms, appears to predispose these women to recurrent vulvovaginal candidal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment/abstract/40,42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42-45</a>]. In general, women with RVVC mount a strong inflammatory response when exposed to small amounts of <em>Candida</em>, whereas normal women may not mount any inflammatory response and remain asymptomatic. IL-4 blocks the anti-<em>Candida</em> response mediated by macrophages; thus, elevated IL-4 levels result in inhibition of local defense mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2693174985\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163901978\"><span class=\"h3\">Azoles</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2855685582\"><span class=\"h4\">Drug regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials comparing different therapeutic regimens have not been performed.

A short-term relapse, with culture confirmation of the diagnosis, merits reinduction therapy with three doses of fluconazole, followed by repeat weekly maintenance fluconazole therapy, this time for one year. A minority of women persist in relapsing as soon as fluconazole maintenance is withdrawn (fluconazole-dependent recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis).

It is important to recognize that fluconazole is one member of the azole class of drugs, and it is difficult to distinguish between patients with allergy to fluconazole alone versus those with allergy to the entire azole class.
