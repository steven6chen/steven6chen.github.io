However, attention to the family history and genetic investigations of families in whom AL <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MDS cases cluster have identified nine genes that cause inherited forms of these diseases that can present throughout the lifespan.</p><p>Here we discuss the recognized syndromes that cause a predisposition to AL <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MDS as the main presenting feature. The many other disorders with an inherited predisposition to AL <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MDS that have other prominent systemic manifestations, such as Down syndrome or neurofibromatosis type I, are reviewed in more detail separately, as are the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, which most frequently present in childhood.

In a study that used next-generation sequencing to determine the contribution of germline predisposition mutations in sporadic pediatric cancer, mutations that were deemed to be pathogenic or probably pathogenic were identified in 26 of 588 (4 percent) patients with pediatric leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, many families in whom MDS and AL cluster test negative for mutations in all of the currently known genes, suggesting that additional causative genes remain to be identified. Because many of the genes that cause the familial AL and MDS syndromes when mutated in the germline or constitutional state are also found as somatic or acquired mutations, prior studies that sequenced these genes at diagnosis in large numbers of presumably de novo AL and MDS cases provide estimates of the maximum number of cases that could be accounted for by each inherited syndrome. Details regarding the maximum prevalence for each described entity are provided in the sections below.</p><p>Variation by race, ethnicity, and geography are not currently known. The families described in most of the familial AL and MDS syndromes appear to have their own private inherited mutations, suggesting independent events rather than a &quot;founder&quot; mutation occurring on an ancestral allele in a particular population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356931794\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING PATIENTS WITH ACUTE LEUKEMIA OR MDS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356931801\"><span class=\"h2\">Whom, when, and how to screen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with AL and MDS should be screened at the time of initial diagnosis or referral to rule out the presence of a familial AL and MDS syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similar screening is also essential during the initial pre-donation health screening evaluation for all individuals (related and unrelated) who wish to serve as an allogeneic hematopoietic cell donor for a person with a hematologic malignancy, either related or unrelated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Screening consists of obtaining a careful medical and family history aimed at identifying signs and symptoms of the known familial AL and MDS syndromes.

A prior history of cancer in the patient is also important for treatment and prognostic purposes.

It is important to note that anticipation has been observed in familial AL and MDS syndromes; thus, a child may present with symptoms prior to a parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Alternatively, parents may have subtle symptoms not yet recognized, and a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and medical history should be considered. Given the rarity of MDS in children, it is reasonable to obtain a CBC in parents of any child with MDS, especially if other worrisome history is elicited from the questions above. Otherwise, we do not routinely perform a CBC in parents of children with AL, unless there is a parental history of abnormal blood counts or worrisome answers to the screening questions above. (See <a href=\"#H356931801\" class=\"local\">'Whom, when, and how to screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who have a personal history of cytopenias long preceding their current AL or MDS diagnosis (eg, an individual with &quot;ITP&quot; since childhood who now has AL) or who have one or more of the organ system manifestations noted above should be referred regardless of the family history. A similar approach should be used for those who have limited knowledge of the family history (eg, adopted patients). (See <a href=\"#H356931801\" class=\"local\">'Whom, when, and how to screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals in whom routine tumor testing identifies a mutation in any of the genes causative of the known familial AL and MDS syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97500\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97500 \">table 1</a>). It is now common in clinical practice to sequence a number of genes for prognostic and therapeutic purposes in leukemia samples at diagnosis. It is important to recognize that testing done from a leukemia or MDS sample may identify a gene mutation that is actually germline rather than acquired. If tumor sequencing identifies a mutation in any of the genes causative of the familial AL and MDS syndromes noted below, clarifying the family and medical history is critical. If the history has any signs or symptoms of the corresponding syndrome, the patient should be referred to a cancer risk provider.</p><p>The urgency of referral should be based on the clinical scenario. For individuals with <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AL</span> who require treatment, referral should be made as soon as possible to allow time for pedigree assessment and genetic testing, if warranted. </p><p>The initial cancer risk assessment alone can aid in clinical treatment decision-making, as the family history may be suggestive enough of a familial syndrome to consider altering clinical management regardless of the genetic testing results. As an example, the following family history is strongly suggestive of an inherited syndrome: a 45-year-old patient is diagnosed with AML and notes a father with AML at age 60, a paternal aunt with MDS at age 52, and a paternal cousin with AML at age 35, all of which are clinically confirmed. Additional history questions as outlined above may help narrow which syndrome is most likely and guide genetic testing. However, even if comprehensive testing for all of the known familial AL and MDS syndrome genes is normal, the family history is consistent with a clinical diagnosis of a familial AL and MDS syndrome and the patient should be managed accordingly. This family is like many others in the literature and in our practice for whom a genetic etiology remains to be identified and research is essential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356931839\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic testing is clinically available for the majority of the known familial AL and MDS syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97500\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97500 \">table 1</a>). Both sequencing and large rearrangement testing are required to rule out an inherited mutation for most of the causative genes. In practice, the currently available tests for these syndromes utilize a traditional Sanger sequencing-based approach, which examines a single gene exon-by-exon. A second test, such as a microarray or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification-based (MLPA) assay, is needed to look for large genomic rearrangements. The turn-around time for both sequencing and rearrangement testing of a single gene is approximately two to four weeks. For situations in which treatment decisions are pending the results of genetic testing, we use an all-at-once approach and perform testing for all relevant genes at the same time. For non-urgent situations, we consider a gene-by-gene approach depending on the phenotype of the individual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family, but often end up testing several genes due to the significant phenotypic overlap of these syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97502\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97502 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Gene panel-based genetic testing assays that use next generation sequencing (NGS) technology to examine many genes simultaneously are now in use in clinical genetic testing for other hereditary cancer syndromes. Similar assays for the familial AL and MDS syndromes are now clinically available (eg, <a href=\"http://dnatesting.uchicago.edu/&amp;token=lz+/lrQ5tw3m7QCLg9saH/m0fEQFKwE0nUA/CibB1HWajcdwiJm/8bbdzEQGgZDQ&amp;TOPIC_ID=93183\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">University of Chicago Genetic Services</a> and <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/labweb/Divisions/MolDiag/MolDiagGen/index.htm&amp;token=XanXB35d+XMpk5sI6cYf6dOBAkmlpYAIcpbkhSzNUjpzLEwWdKDMmubHa8mTI0jzMKA6xet3YmqI2UfXumT7GTKkcqhmbEAgTlEP8HBh4b8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=93183\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The University of Washington</a> laboratories). A gene panel-based assay that includes all of the relevant genes allows a more cost-effective approach to broad-based testing in these individuals. Turnaround time in practice has been about six to eight weeks. Tissue selection is critical with laboratories often requiring skin fibroblast specimens in those with active hematologic malignancies. It is important to check specimen requirements with individual laboratories prior to sending a specimen for this testing. Ongoing research utilizing more extensive gene panels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> whole exome sequencing on both a clinical and research basis will likely continue to identify new genes that cause inherited forms of MDS or AL. The discovery of these new syndromes will require the cooperation of clinicians and researchers from around the world to define the clinical phenotype, specific cancer risks, and optimal clinical management of individuals who carry each mutation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356931846\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue selection for genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral blood is the tissue source utilized for genetic testing for most hereditary conditions. For many with hematologic malignancies, however, peripheral blood is tumor tissue and, therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider what tissue source is utilized for genetic testing in these individuals. Genetic variants identified using peripheral blood in these individuals may be tumor-specific, somatic, acquired genetic variants <strong>or</strong> inherited, constitutional, germline variants. Genetic testing of an alternative tissue source not involved by the hematologic malignancy is necessary to confirm that any genetic variants identified are, in fact, germline. Of the available sources, only skin fibroblasts are an unequivocal source of germline DNA.</p><p>There are benefits and limitations to each tissue type selected for genetic testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97501 \">table 2</a>). The tissue type should be selected based on the urgency of the testing scenario, the sample requirements of the chosen genetic testing laboratory, and the ability of a local laboratory to process specific samples such as skin biopsy specimens for fibroblast culture. The common tissues utilized and the practical considerations of each include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin fibroblasts</strong> &ndash; Skin fibroblasts are considered the optimal tissue for genetic testing in individuals with peripheral blood involvement of a hematologic malignancy and in those who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Skin fibroblasts are easily grown from a 3 mm punch skin biopsy or small skin ellipse taken at the site of the skin nick for a bone marrow biopsy procedure. A local Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory must be readily available to process and culture the specimen and coordinate sample send-out with the laboratory that will perform the genetic testing. Using this tissue source adds the additional costs of the skin biopsy and culture and requires approximately three to four weeks for adequate growth prior to send-out for genetic testing. Thus, in urgent testing scenarios, we recommend performing a skin biopsy for culture to be used for any required confirmatory genetic testing at the time another tissue source is sent for genetic testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hair and nails</strong> &ndash; These sample sources are also easy to obtain and contain alternative tissue for germline testing. However, the amount of DNA that can be isolated from these samples is often limited, making them most useful for small numbers of PCR-based assays. In addition, many CLIA-approved laboratories do not accept these samples for clinical testing. Therefore, they are used more often as sources of DNA for research purposes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Saliva and buccal swabs</strong> &ndash; These sample types are readily available, inexpensive, and contain epithelial cells as an alternative tissue source for genetic testing. However, both contain a significant number of cells derived from the peripheral blood, resulting in tumor contamination in many hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral blood with active hematologic malignancy involvement</strong> &ndash; This sample may be the only readily available sample type that meets requirements for urgent testing at some genetic testing laboratories. If this sample is used, the patient should be counseled about the limitations of the genetic testing results and the need to confirm any findings in a non-involved tissue type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral blood or bone marrow in remission</strong> &ndash; These sample sources can be considered for genetic testing in individuals who have not undergone prior allogeneic HCT. However, the specific hematologic malignancy and the depth of clinical remission must be considered carefully. For individuals with AML, for example, data have shown persistence of acquired mutations in a founding leukemia clone despite morphologic remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, some normal healthy individuals develop clonal hematopoiesis featuring MDS and AL-associated gene mutations (eg, <em>TET2</em> mutations), which occurs more often with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These concepts must be kept in mind when performing germline genetic testing from the peripheral blood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1276516133\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF AT-RISK FAMILY MEMBERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All of the known familial AL and MDS syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Thus, all first-degree relatives of an affected individual have a 50 percent chance of carrying the same mutation. All of these individuals should be offered genetic counseling and genetic testing to determine whether they carry the familial mutation. </p><p>Genetic testing of at-risk children is warranted for syndromes with manifestations in childhood. With the possible exception of the autosomal dominant telomere syndromes, childhood onset MDS or AL or other hematopoietic or organ system manifestations can be seen in most of these syndromes so genetic testing through pediatric cancer risk professionals should be considered. Pretest and post-test genetic counseling are key to aid each individual in understanding his or her genetic test results and the resulting health implications. Affected individuals of childbearing age can also be counseled about the availability of preimplantation genetic diagnosis if desired.</p><p>For each syndrome, early identification of at-risk family members allows management of any related hematopoietic or other organ system manifestations as well as monitoring for signs of hematologic malignancy development. Individuals with an inherited mutation who have not yet developed AL or MDS should be followed with regular complete blood counts and physical exams. A bone marrow biopsy should be performed at baseline and at the time of any significant change in blood counts.</p><p>In familial platelet disorder with propensity to myeloid malignancies (FPD), thrombocytopenia 2 (THC2), and thrombocytopenia 5 (THC5), identifying the causative mutation can help individuals avoid misdiagnosis with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and inappropriate interventions such as steroids or splenectomy. These individuals can also be informed about the possibility of excessive bleeding due to platelet dysfunction so they can help educate health care providers who may care for them. In familial <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> with mutated <em>GATA2</em> and autosomal dominant telomere syndromes due to <em>TERT</em> or <em>TERC</em> mutations, immunodeficiencies and organ system manifestations can be identified and managed and screening for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related malignancies and head and neck or anogenital cancers in the two disorders, respectively, performed. Lastly, knowledge of the mutation status of individuals within a family aids in the timely identification of a suitable allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell donor, should one be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356931881\"><span class=\"h1\">THE KNOWN INHERITED LEUKEMIA AND MDS SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of each of the known inherited AL and MDS syndromes are detailed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97500\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97500 \">table 1</a>).

Thus, it may be difficult to distinguish de novo cases from those with a germline predisposition based solely on the age of onset of disease. Generally, patients with germline <em>DDX41</em> mutations develop normal karyotype high grade myeloid neoplasms, including a variety of MDS subtypes (eg, refractory cytopenias with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with excess blasts, and 5q- syndrome) as well as AML and CMML, all with a poor prognosis.

In a study of six families, heterozygous mutations in a fourth gene, <em>IKZF1</em>, the gene encoding the transcription factor IKAROS, caused an autosomal dominant form of common variable immune deficiency (CVID) characterized by a progressive loss of serum immunoglobulins and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Two unrelated children from different families each with a unique <em>IKZF1 </em>mutation developed B cell ALL at ages three and five years. <em>IKZF1</em> is known to have a critical role in hematopoiesis and mutations in <em>IKZF1</em> have been identified in sporadic ALL.

Interestingly, all three pedigrees carried the same mutation (c.547G&gt;A), which results in substitution of a serine for a glycine at position 183 of the protein, despite coming from widely different ethnic backgrounds.

Prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the personal and family history of the donor and recipient should be reassessed to rule out the presence of a familial leukemia or MDS.

For situations in which treatment decisions are pending the results of genetic testing, we use an all-at-once approach and perform testing for all relevant genes at the same time, now most often via gene panel testing. For non-urgent situations, we consider a gene-by-gene approach especially if the phenotype of the individual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family is highly suggestive of a specific syndrome.

Genetic testing of an alternative tissue source not involved by the hematologic malignancy is necessary to confirm that any genetic variants identified are, in fact, germline. Of the available sources, only skin fibroblasts are an unequivocal source of germline DNA.
