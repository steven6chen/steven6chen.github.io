It is most common in women with darker complexions who live in areas of intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Melasma causes considerable cosmetic disfigurement and psychologic distress; quality-of-life studies have shown a significant negative effect of melasma on emotional wellbeing, social life, and leisure activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of melasma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10604381\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of melasma is unknown. Studies from Mexico and Peru found that melasma accounted for 4 to 10 percent of new dermatology hospital referrals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. It is more common in women than in men and is rare before puberty, occurring most frequently in women of reproductive age. Melasma occurs during pregnancy in approximately 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among pregnant women, the prevalence of melasma ranges between 15 and 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of melasma is poorly understood. Contributing factors include darker skin phototype (especially III and IV), ultraviolet (UV) radiation, hormonal factors (eg, pregnancy, oral contraceptives), genetic predisposition, cosmetic use, thyroid dysfunction, and antiepileptic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/1,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-14</a>].</p><p>The key role of exposure to UV radiation in the development of melasma is supported by the distribution pattern of facial hyperpigmentation, which spares relatively sun-protected sites such as the philtrum. UV radiation induces melanocyte proliferation and migration and melanogenesis; it also increases the levels of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone, which in turn upregulate melanocyte proliferation and melanogenesis. In patients with darker skin, visible light also may have a role in increasing skin pigmentation. In a study involving 20 volunteers with skin type IV to VI, both visible light and long-wavelength UVA (UVA1, 340 to 400 nm) were able to induce immediate pigmentation, but the pigmentation was more intense and more stable after visible light exposure than after UVA exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Melasma may be caused by the presence of more biologically active melanocytes in the affected skin. A transcriptional analysis of 279 genes found that, although the number of melanocytes was similar in lesional and perilesional skin, many melanin biosynthesis-related genes and melanocyte markers (eg, tyrosinase, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, silver locus protein homolog, tyrosinase-related protein 1) were upregulated only in melasma lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Dermal factors also may have a role in the development of melasma. Overexpression of both stem cell factor from fibroblast and tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit has been found in melasma lesions and may be associated with increased melanogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. An increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been demonstrated in melasma skin, supporting the observation of an increased vascularity in melasma skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, the finding that human normal melanocytes in vitro express VEGF receptors suggests a direct role of VEGF on melanocytes in the pathogenesis of melasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The role of female hormones is supported by the observation that the onset of melasma is associated with pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives in approximately half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Elevated levels of estrogen, progesterone, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy, may be involved in melanocyte stimulation. Estrogen and progesterone receptors have been demonstrated in human melanocytes in vitro, and the expression of estrogen receptors appears to be increased in melasma lesional skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. It is unclear whether hormonal factors play a role in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10604517\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of melasma is an increased melanin deposition in all layers of epidermis seen on Fontana-Masson staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Solar elastosis and mast cells are more prominent in melasma lesions than in normal skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Based upon the distribution of melanin deposition, melasma has been classically classified in three histologic types: epidermal (melanin increased in the epidermis), dermal (melanophages in the dermis), and mixed. However, this classification has been questioned based upon the observation that all patients with melasma appear to have increased epidermal melanin content and that dermal melanophages can be detected in both lesional and nonlesional skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/24,25,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,27,28</a>]. However, reflectance confocal microscopy studies have shown that, in some patients, the number of melanophages may be increased in some lesions but not in others and that, within the same lesion, the distribution of melanophages may be nonuniform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Some, but not all, studies have reported increased numbers of melanocytes in melasma lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/10,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24,25</a>]. In one study involving 21 patients, Mel-5 immunostaining demonstrated a normal number of enlarged, intensely stained melanocytes with prominent dendrites in the affected areas; electron microscopy revealed increased melanosomes in both melanocytes and keratinocytes in involved skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. An increase in number and size of blood vessels in melasma lesions also has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/18,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with melasma present with irregularly shaped, hyperpigmented macules on the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75884%7EDERM%2F64109%7EDERM%2F52220\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75884 graphicRef64109 graphicRef52220 \">picture 1A-C</a>). The color varies from light brown to dark brown or <span class=\"nowrap\">ash/blue,</span> depending upon the site of melanin deposition in the skin. Usually, a lighter color is associated with presence of melanin in the epidermis or upper dermis, whereas dermal melanin is most often associated with a <span class=\"nowrap\">grey/blue</span> hue.</p><p>The hyperpigmented macules are often confluent and symmetrically distributed. Three patterns of involvement are typically seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Centrofacial, involving the cheeks, forehead, upper lip, nose, and chin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malar, involving the cheeks and nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mandibular, involving the ramus of the mandible</p><p/><p>Less frequently, melasma can occur on the extensor aspect of the forearms and upper chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89286\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89286 \">picture 2</a>). Lesions typically appear or are accentuated after sun exposure and tend to be persistent. Melasma due to pregnancy usually regresses within a year after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]; however, areas of hyperpigmentation may never completely resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In men, melasma shares the same clinical and histologic features as in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10604727\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of melasma is based upon history and the clinical finding of symmetrically distributed hyperpigmented macules on the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75884%7EDERM%2F64109\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75884 graphicRef64109 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Elements of history that support the diagnosis include onset in relation to pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives, family history of melasma, and exposure to phototoxic drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Phototoxicity'</a>.)</p><p>Examination under Wood&rsquo;s light may be helpful in identifying the pattern of pigment deposition. Epidermal melasma is enhanced when viewed under a Wood&rsquo;s light, whereas dermal melasma is not. However, most patients have a &quot;mixed&quot; picture on Wood light examination, with enhancement in some areas and none in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Under natural light, epidermal and mixed melasma appear light to dark brown in color, whereas dermal melasma has a bluish or ashen gray hue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2353236\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The melasma area and severity index (MASI) was created in an attempt to standardize the subjective evaluation of melasma in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is based upon the percentage of the area involved in each of four regions (forehead, right malar area, left malar area, and chin), darkness, and homogeneity. Darkness and homogeneity are graded by comparison with the normal skin. The MASI score is calculated by multiplying the sum of the severity grades for darkness and homogeneity by the percentage of the facial area involved and ranges from 0 to 48.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10604741\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of melasma includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation</strong> &ndash; Localized hyperpigmentation of the face can occur as a result of several inflammatory conditions, including acne, eczema, contact dermatitis, and superficial injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78119\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78119 \">picture 3</a>). The diagnosis is based upon a history of inflammatory skin disorder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the coexistence of inflammatory lesion in the same area or elsewhere on the body.

The medication history can provide a clue to the correct diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pigmented contact dermatitis</strong> &ndash; Pigmented contact dermatitis (Riehl melanosis) is thought to be caused by repeated contact with cosmetic ingredients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It presents with a grey-brown reticular facial pigmentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89290\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89290 \">picture 5</a>) and is seen most often in middle-aged women, especially those with darker skin tones.

Patients should be educated about the importance of adopting sun protection measures, including sun avoidance, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and using broad-spectrum sunscreens, during and after treatment. (See <a href=\"#H249352121\" class=\"local\">'Photoprotection'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatments include skin-lightening agents, chemical peels, and laser and light-based therapy. Because no single therapy has proven to be beneficial for all patients with melasma, combinations of agents or modalities are often used, especially in recalcitrant cases.</p><p>Patients should be informed that continued application of topical skin-lightening agents for up to six months may be required before a reduction in pigmentation occurs. In most cases, long-term, intermittent use of skin-lightening agents is necessary to maintain depigmentation. (See <a href=\"#H1257250\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Melasma may have a negative impact on social life and emotional wellbeing. Cosmetic camouflage is an option for patients with unsatisfactory response to treatment who have feelings of embarrassment, depression, and social inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of sunscreen and sun-protective measures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest daily use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 30 or higher for patients with all types of melasma. Sunscreen should be applied in an adequate amount before going out and reapplied every two hours while outdoors. </p><p>Sunscreens alone for the treatment of melasma have never been evaluated in clinical trials. However, based upon clinical experience, there is ample consent among clinicians that all individuals with melasma should use daily a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF of at least 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Broad-spectrum sunscreens may enhance the efficacy of skin-lightening agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In a randomized trial, 96 percent of women using a topical combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> and broad-spectrum sunscreen achieved a slight to marked improvement versus 81 percent of those using hydroquinone alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melasma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Regular use of broad-spectrum sunscreens may prevent the development of pregnancy-associated melasma.
