Many clinical situations are appropriate for the placement of indwelling urethral catheters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76684 \">table 1</a>), but too frequently they are used without proper indication or continued longer than needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Daily evaluation of the ongoing need for the indwelling catheters with removal when no longer indicated is essential to reduce complications.</p><p>This topic will discuss the complications associated with urinary catheter use. The indications for placement, types, and management of urinary catheters are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Rates vary depending upon the type of catheter and duration of use. The evaluation of bacteriuria and diagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults#H123173127\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic bacteriuria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Recurrent urinary tract infections as a result of chronic catheter use can lead to acute or chronic pyelonephritis, or bladder cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Epididymitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethral instrumentation of any type can cause epididymitis, which may rarely disseminate to the testes as orchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Retained balloon fragments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous rupture of the urinary catheter balloon can occur. If the catheter spontaneously falls out, the integrity of the balloon should be examined carefully for any missing material. If balloon fragments cannot be located, cystoscopy should be performed to identify fragments retained in the bladder as these have the potential to cause urethral obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Balloon rupture can occur spontaneously, but also from the attempt to bluntly rupture or overdistend a balloon that will not deflate; this practice is not advised. Sharp balloon puncture to manage a non-deflating balloon (ie, percutaneous spinal needle) was not found to be associated with retained balloon fragments in one experimental study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults&quot;, section on 'Troubleshooting catheter removal'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of air or feces in the urine of a patient with an indwelling catheter may indicate the formation of a fistula. Fistulas can occur between the bladder and small intestine, colon, rectum, or vagina (ie, enterovesical, colovesical, rectovesical, and vesicovaginal). They are an uncommon complication of indwelling bladder catheters and more likely to occur in the setting of prolonged catheterization with risk factors that include malignancy, inflammation, radiotherapy, or trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder perforation, both intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal, is rare but has been reported with long-term indwelling catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Hematuria and abdominal pain may indicate acute perforation; free air is seen only with intraperitoneal perforation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder stone formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stones can form in the bladder due to the presence of a foreign body. Bacteria that are urea-splitting (eg, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>) are frequently associated with stone formation. The type of catheter may influence stone formation; however, there are no data to support the use of one catheter material (ie, latex, silicon) over another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS SPECIFIC TO TYPE OF CATHETER</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Condom catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most complications related to condom catheter usage are due to improper or prolonged application, and inadequate monitoring of the device when in place. Most complications are minor and self-limited; however, significant penile injury resulting in scarring and deformity can occur.</p><p>Patients with penile skin sensory loss (ie, spinal injury patients) are at the highest risk for more severe complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Instruction of the patient, relatives, and medical personnel on the proper application of the condom device is essential in preventing associated complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults&quot;, section on 'External catheter placement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Pressure effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin depigmentation can occur but is more likely in patients with underlying dermatologic conditions. </p><p>Constrictive effects of the condom catheter's adhesive band or roller ring can lead to superficial ulceration. Reapplication exacerbates the ulcer and can prevent healing. The condom catheter should be temporarily discontinued and a catheter (intermittent or indwelling) used until the site is healed.</p><p>Prolonged continuous pressure of the penis from an improperly placed condom catheter can cause tissue ischemia, which may lead to penile <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urethral necrosis. Treatment with surgical debridement is necessary to remove devitalized tissue, and reconstruction with skin grafts to the penis may be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Urethral catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical catheter problems such as leakage, catheter blockage, and catheter rejection are common and can frustrate and annoy both patient and clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Knowledge of catheter technology and routine catheter care can help reduce mechanical problems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults&quot;, section on 'Catheter technology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults&quot;, section on 'Catheter care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects of urethral trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic urethral catheter placement can lead to urethral injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99863\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99863 \">image 1</a>). A systematic review found that the pooled percentage of patients who developed urethral stricture or erosion was 3.4 percent among seven high-quality studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The presence of pain and bleeding following attempted catheter insertion, and subsequent inability to pass the catheter into the bladder suggests that a false urethral passage may have been created. Such injuries usually require significant reconstructive surgery.</p><p>Inflammation and infection of the periurethral soft tissues may create an abscess as a consequence of the creation of a false passage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If the abscess is not visible on physical examination, diagnosis may be delayed and the infection can spread into surrounding tissues. Urethrocutaneous fistulae may result as the infection tracks to the skin. Fournier's gangrene has been reported as a consequence of urethral catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stricture associated with urethral catheterization occurs almost exclusively in male patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Repeated urethral trauma from intermittent catheterization can cause urethral stricture formation, which in turn increases the likelihood of traumatic catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The incidence of urethral stricture increases with duration of chronic catheterization; most have developed following at least five years of intermittent catheterization (IC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incontinence can occur due to catheterization and is also related to urethral sphincter dysfunction.

Complications associated with initial placement include cutaneous or bladder bleeding and bowel injury, which is more common if suprapubic catheter placement is attempted when the bladder is not fully distended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The most effective strategies to reduce infectious complications of urinary catheters are avoidance of unnecessary catheterization and catheter removal when the catheter is no longer indicated. Adherence to a protocol for indwelling catheter placement, care, and removal can reduce the incidence of urinary tract infection and other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>].</p><p>Measures which help prevent complications associated with urinary catheters include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of urinary catheters only for appropriate indications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76684 \">table 1</a>).

When urinary bladder catheters are required, adequate training of the patient, hospital personnel, and caregivers is essential to avoid complications related to placement, to ensure proper care, and to promptly recognize and treat complications expeditiously when they do occur. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common complication of urinary bladder catheters is catheter-associated urinary tract infection. In males, urinary infection can lead to epididymitis or orchitis. Other rare complications of indwelling catheters include urinary tract obstruction from retained balloon fragments, bladder fistula, bladder perforation, or bladder stone formation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improper or prolonged application of condom catheters can cause pressure-related complications including skin depigmentation, ulceration, or penile necrosis. These complications are more frequent in patients with penile sensory loss and can be prevented with proper application of the device and frequent patient monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Condom catheters'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The traumatic insertion of urethral catheters can create a false passage, which if infected may lead to periurethral abscess. This complication is more frequent in patients with prior urethral stricture and can result in significant soft tissue infection. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Effects of urethral trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term complications associated with chronic urethral catheters (indwelling or intermittent) include urethral stricture and incontinence. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Urethral catheters'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When properly placed, complications from the placement of suprapubic catheters are uncommon. Inadvertent bowel injury can occur during percutaneous suprapubic catheter placement if the bladder is not fully distended, or the needle is not visualized with cystoscopy when performing the procedure in patients with prior pelvic surgery.
