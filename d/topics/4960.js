An individual experiencing depersonalization may report feeling like an automaton or as if in a dream or as if watching himself or herself in a movie. Depersonalized individuals may report the sense of being an outside observer of their mental processes or their body.

In a non-urban United States sample, the one-year prevalence of depersonalization symptoms was approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a large normative sample of German adolescents, 12 percent reported clinically significant depersonalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Approximately half of college students in another United States study reported experiencing an episode of depersonalization in the past year. Adolescents and young adults appear to be at the highest risk for reporting such symptoms, possibly because their sense of self is still fluid and developmentally unstable. </p><p>Transient depersonalization symptoms, which may be primary or secondary to another condition, are more common than <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder (DDD), which is primary and associated with greater mobility and some chronicity. Studies from several countries including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Turkey, and Germany have shown a lifetime prevalence for DDD in the range of 0.8 percent to 2.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], comparable to that of other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2022925\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DDD has been found to be equally common in men and women in clinical samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Common risk factors for depersonalization and derealization include the following. It is important to note that in a portion of patients there are no clearly identifiable precipitants:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute and chronic trauma or severe stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric conditions, most commonly anxiety or depressive disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance abuse </p><p/><p>Chronic depersonalization and derealization has been reported in as many as one-third to one-half of individuals experiencing chronic traumatic or highly stressful situations.

As an example, in a study of 117 United States adults with DDD, the lifetime prevalence of comorbid disorders was as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unipolar depression, 73 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any anxiety disorder, 64 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obsessive-compulsive disorder, 21 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidant personality disorder, 23 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Borderline personality disorder, 21 percent </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10289535\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pathogenesis of <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder (DDD) has not been established, it is generally assumed that the syndrome becomes manifest in individuals who have inherent diatheses combined with psychological <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemical stressors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H820260\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute depersonalization and derealization are quintessential responses to acute trauma (such as a motor vehicle accident) or other life-threatening experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], speculated to be hardwired into the brain so that a sense of distance and detachment from the traumatic event can facilitate surviving and negotiating the event without experiencing overwhelming, disorganizing emotion, ie, &ldquo;going through the motions&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, acute depersonalization and derealization symptoms occurring in the above circumstances typically clear within minutes, hours, or days, and do not become chronic. Chronic depersonalization and derealization symptoms, qualifying for the disorder are more common among persons experiencing chronic traumatic or highly stressful situations such verbal or emotional abuse or neglect during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Other situations include growing up frightened by a parent with severe mental illness, traumatically struggling with sexual orientation, or experiencing the unexpected death or suicide of a family member or close friend. Sexual abuse and severe physical abuse are less common antecedents of <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder but can clearly occur. Numerous other severe life stressors (interpersonal, financial, or occupational) have been associated with onset or exacerbation of DDD. Examples include a very difficult divorce, academic failure, or job loss. It should be noted, however, that acute, short-lived traumas or stressors can trigger the onset of the disorder as well. (See <a href=\"#H2022925\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Chronic depersonalization and derealization symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria for the disorder have also been reported to begin during severe or prolonged episodes of a mood or anxiety disorder, which may destabilize the sense of usual expected self and in itself act as a powerful internal stressor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This pattern occurs in approximately one-third of all patients with DDD. Typically in this scenario, the depersonalization and derealization symptoms set in at some point of escalation of the original disorder, but persist or worsen on a long-term basis after the precipitating disorder has spontaneously remitted or been treated, taking on an independent course, a &ldquo;life of its own.&rdquo; </p><p>The traumas reported by DDD patients are generally less severe than those typically reported by patients with other dissociative disorders, such as dissociative identity disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

In such cases the diagnosis of the disorder is not made, as it requires the exclusion of such &ldquo;organic&rdquo; underpinnings.</p><p>Substance abuse has been known to precipitate chronic depersonalization in some people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2022362\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>These individuals can thus be conceptualized as having a neurobiological or genetic vulnerability to the onset of chronic depersonalization and derealization, ie, DDD, after drug use. A large survey study has shown that the characteristics and course of the condition do not differ between drug-induced and non-drug-induced cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H409471\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurobiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several neurotransmitter systems, brain regions, and functional circuits have been associated with depersonalization and derealization symptoms with some consistency and are summarized below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) system &ndash; NMDA receptors are widely distributed in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, and mediate associative processes. The NMDA antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> induces a profound dissociative state in healthy subjects that is distinct, both phenomenologically and in the implicated brain pathways, from the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. For example, pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> in healthy volunteers reduces the dissociative impact of ketamine administration, possibly via NMDA receptor blockade, but not the psychotomimetic impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Ketamine has complex pharmacodynamics and effects on other neurotransmitter systems, including Kappa opioid receptors that could relate to the acute induction of depersonalization and derealization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endogenous cannabinoid system &ndash; Cannabis has been experimentally shown to induce depersonalization in healthy volunteers, with a pronounced component of temporal disintegration, and particular brain regions have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Cannabinoids block NMDA receptors at sites distinct from other noncompetitive NMDA antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and therefore their dissociative effect may be partly mediated via NMDA antagonism, as well as by the endogenous cannabinoid system. Of interest, unlike psychotic disorders in which a dose-response relationship has been demonstrated with lifetime cannabis use, DDD can be induced by sporadic, sometimes even single, use of cannabis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], especially when associated with a &ldquo;bad trip&rdquo; that is experienced as terrifying or life-threatening. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kappa opioid agonists &ndash; The illicit drug salvia, which acts as a selective kappa opioid agonist, has been found to precipitate chronic depersonalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In an experimental study of healthy volunteers, placebo-controlled pharmacological challenge with the kappa opioid agonist enadoline induced a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; depersonalization-like syndrome with perceptual disturbances and a sense of detachment in the absence of prominent mood, anxiety, or psychotomimetic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although selective kappa opioid antagonists are still in Phase II trials, non-selective antagonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a>, and nalmefene, which have varying affinity for the kappa receptor, have been reported to diminish dissociative symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serotonin agonists &ndash; Hallucinogens act as agonists at serotonin 5HT2A and especially 5HT2C receptors, and experimental challenge studies with the partial 5HT2A and C agonist m-CPP have demonstrated the induction of depersonalization in a mixed group of social phobia, borderline personality disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], the induction of flashbacks and dissociative symptoms in a subgroup of PTSD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and the induction of dissociation in healthy volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic hypo-reactivity &ndash; There is some evidence for autonomic hypo-reactivity in DDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a study of 15 patients with the disorder, compared with subjects with anxiety disorders and healthy controls, DDD subjects exhibited reduced magnitude and increased latency of skin conductance response to unpleasant stimuli, but not to non-specific stimuli, suggesting a selective inhibition of emotional processing. Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter central to facilitating alertness, selective attention, and enhanced memory encoding under stressful conditions. 24-hour urine norepinephrine was also found to be strongly inversely correlated to depersonalization severity in nine subjects with DDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis &ndash; The HPA axis has been investigated in DDD with conflicting findings.

Unfamiliarity with these symptoms may lead individuals to fear that they may be taken for &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; or will become crazy. This is especially common in those raised in homes with severely mentally ill parents. Both of these factors, as well as clinicians&rsquo; typical focus on comorbid symptoms such as mood and anxiety, contribute to frequent underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder (DDD). </p><p>Symptoms, although quite specific, may sound vague or metaphorical rather than clear subjective experiences, such as &ldquo;feeling dead,&rdquo; &ldquo;everything is unreal,&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;m the one doing anything,&rdquo; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m watching a movie,&rdquo; etc. The symptoms are typically extremely distressing, at times crippling, and are associated with major morbidity and some mortality. The affectively flattened and robotic demeanor that these patients often demonstrate can also fool the clinician into not recognizing the extreme emotional pain of the condition. It is not uncommon, for example, for patients to wonder whether it would matter if they died. A relative high rate of suicide attempts was associated with DDD; however, given the high rates of comorbid depression and other psychiatric disorders in DDD, the relationship between suicidality and DDD remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>].

In a series of 117 cases of patients with DDD, approximately one third of individuals had an episodic course; one-third had a continuous course from time of onset; and one third initially had an episodic course that over time became continuous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Many patients with chronic depersonalization and derealization experience marked impairment in occupational, social, and personal functioning.

DDD patients were younger, significantly more male, had a longer illness duration, earlier age of onset, and tended to show greater functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Available research suggests that onset is most commonly in late adolescence or early adulthood, with onset of the disorder rarely occurring as late as the fourth or fifth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Onset may be very sudden or insidious. Most patients with DDD are initially treated for secondary anxiety and mood disorder symptoms; the primary nature of the DDD may not be recognized until later. Once chronic depersonalization has set in, new traumatic or stressful events or episodes of other illness may lead to exacerbations of the symptoms. </p><p>Depersonalization or derealization that follows traumatic or stressful experiences or intoxication commonly remits acutely and spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] In our clinical experience, depersonalization accompanying mood or anxiety disorders commonly remits with definitive treatment of these conditions, especially if treated early in their course.

Our clinical experience suggests that it may not be useful or effective to diagnose and treat DDD unless the symptoms continue for a month or possibly longer. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for DDD do not specify a minimal duration of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2022362\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed psychiatric history and mental status exam can distinguish DDD from other mental disorders and medical conditions, including those below.

The differentiation from a prodromal psychotic syndrome can be made based on the presence of perceptual alterations that are not accompanied by magical ideation-type interpretations of the symptoms. As an example, a patient with DDD may feel as if they are dead and simply dreaming their lives. However, if asked whether this were truly so, the patient should be able to reply that they know they are alive in this world.</p><p>Another feature differentiating DDD from psychotic disorders is that the report of an &ldquo;as if&rdquo; experience of depersonalization typically is not accompanied by distorted cognitive explanations. A study comparing perceptual alterations and magical ideation in patients with DDD and healthy volunteers found that people with the disorder only had elevated perceptual, but not cognitive, distortions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H409772\"><span class=\"h3\">Other conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic depersonalization and derealization may less commonly result from a medical or neurological condition (eg, temporal lobe epilepsy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>], or be secondary to substance abuse (most commonly marijuana, hallucinogens, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, and salvia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,49</a>].
