They are classified as distinct entities, but in reality, they represent a spectrum of sleep-related behaviors that occur as a result of incomplete transition out of deep NREM sleep.</p><p>While disorders of arousal typically present in childhood, they may continue into adulthood, remit and recur in adulthood, or present de novo in adults. NREM disorders of arousal must be distinguished from other sleep-related conditions that occur in adults, including rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), movement disorders of sleep, and nocturnal seizures.</p><p>Disorders of arousal are an important cause of sleep-related injury in adults. Management consists primarily of education, environmental and behavioral modifications to promote safety, and identification of predisposing and triggering factors to minimize the number of episodes.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of disorders of arousal in adults will be reviewed here. A more general approach to abnormal movements and behaviors during sleep is presented elsewhere. Other parasomnias in adults and disorders of arousal and other parasomnias in children are also reviewed separately.

A cross-sectional study of over 19,000 noninstitutionalized adults found that while over 15 percent of the sample reported confusional arousals in the prior year, all but 0.9 percent were in association with other sleep disorders (circadian rhythm disorders or long sleepers), psychiatric disorders (bipolar or panic disorder), or use of psychotropic drugs (mainly antidepressant medications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Sleepwalking affects approximately 15 percent of children and 4 percent of adults, with peak prevalence between ages 8 and 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Onset in adulthood is observed in approximately 15 percent of cases, and childhood-onset sleepwalking continues into adulthood in 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Sleep terrors affect up to 3 percent of adults, often in association with other disorders of arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a series of 100 adult sleepwalkers, sleep terrors were reported by 64 percent and sleep talking by 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819282965\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep and wakefulness are not mutually exclusive states. Therefore, dysfunction in the orchestration of neural pathways regulating wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep can produce state dissociation, resulting in the ability to perform complex motor behaviors outside of consciousness.</p><p>Disorders of arousal manifest when there is an incomplete dissociation of NREM sleep into wakefulness, leading to clinical states of sleep with central nervous system activation of skeletal muscle and autonomic networks. Sleep inertia and sleep fragmentation each promote the occurrence of abnormal behaviors. Accordingly, NREM arousal instability, represented by changes in cyclic alternating patterns, is often observed in affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Activation of central pattern generators has also been implicated. Pattern generators are genetically determined or learned neural circuits located in the mesencephalon, pons, and spinal cord that code for self-sustained patterns of behavior that are essential for survival. Activation of central pattern generators results in primitive behaviors that would normally be suppressed during wakefulness, including eating, locomotion, aggression, and sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Genetic factors play a role, particularly in the case of sleepwalking. Compared with the general population, first-degree relatives of sleepwalkers have a 10-fold or higher increased likelihood of sleepwalking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a series of 100 adult sleepwalkers, 57 percent had a positive familial history, which in the majority of cases was a first-degree relative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Family studies have identified several potential candidate genes, including the adenosine deaminase gene on chromosome 20q12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2996744184\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders of arousal have a strong association with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, also called sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A common pathophysiologic mechanism involving cholinergic pathways in the ascending arousal system has been hypothesized. In families with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, causative mutations have been identified in various subunits of the nicotine acetylcholine receptor gene (eg, <em>CHRNA4</em>, <em>CHRNB2</em>, <em>CHRNA2</em>) and in the corticotrophin-releasing hormone gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Receptor mutations confer a gain of function, with increased sensitivity to acetylcholine that may lead to changes in the excitability of cortical and subcortical networks and, at the same time, altering arousal mechanisms and destabilizing sleep. The lifetime prevalence of disorders of arousal is nearly fivefold greater in relatives of probands with nocturnal frontal epilepsy than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and approximately one-third of probands report a personal or family history of parasomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes#H2948959093\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes&quot;, section on 'Nocturnal (sleep-related) focal epilepsies'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1725867\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders of arousal constitute a spectrum of complex nocturnal behaviors that arise as a result of incomplete arousal from deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The behaviors most commonly arise from slow wave sleep (stage N3), usually in the first third of the major sleep period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104210\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104210 \">figure 1</a>). They may also arise from other NREM stages anytime during sleep, including daytime naps. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep#H630021595\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;, section on 'NREM sleep'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819283097\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Affected individuals exhibit a spectrum of behaviors outside of consciousness, generally without dream imagery and followed by partial or complete amnesia for the event (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104869 \">table 1</a>). In contrast to nocturnal seizures, disorders of arousal are not typically stereotyped and vary over time. Several minutes of confusion after an event is typically followed by a return to sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1725873\"><span class=\"h3\">Confusional arousals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confusional arousals (also referred to as Elpenor syndrome, sleep drunkenness, or sleep inertia) are episodes of mental confusion or confusional behavior during an arousal or awakening from nocturnal sleep or a daytime nap. They represent an interval of &quot;excessive sleep inertia,&quot; defined as confusion and disorientation during and following arousals from slow wave sleep. Responsiveness to environmental stimuli is reduced, although patients appear to be awake and may exhibit goal-directed behaviors. </p><p>Speech is generally slow and devoid of content. Affected individuals typically appear bewildered and have little to no memory of the event. Unlike in sleepwalking and sleep terrors, motor features in confusional arousals are less complex and do not include any form of ambulation (as in sleepwalking) or sympathetic activation (as in sleep terrors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The duration of a confusional arousal is usually a few minutes to less than 15 minutes, although episodes as long as several hours have been described. Episodes typically arise from slow wave sleep during the first part of the sleep period, but they can also arise during the transition from sleep to wakefulness in the morning or from light NREM sleep.</p><p>In adults, confusional arousals are often observed in patients with other sleep <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As with other disorders of arousal, precipitants include sleep deprivation, use of sedative hypnotics or sleep aids before bedtime, and sudden awakening from sleep. (See <a href=\"#H1819283068\" class=\"local\">'Common precipitating factors'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1725879\"><span class=\"h4\">Sleep-related abnormal sexual behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-related abnormal sexual behavior (also referred to as atypical sexual activity during sleep, sexsomnia, or sleep sex) is a confusional arousal variant that is characterized by abnormal sexual behaviors without awareness of intention. Behaviors may include prolonged or violent masturbation and sexual vocalizations, initiation of sexual intercourse with bed partners, or sexual assault of minors or adults who may be in close proximity to the patient.</p><p>As in other types of confusional arousals, episodes typically occur one to two hours after sleep onset from NREM sleep. Many patients have comorbid obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the treatment of which can reduce or eliminate sexual behaviors. Episodes may occur in isolation or in association with sleepwalking, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), or parasomnia overlap disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1819283068\" class=\"local\">'Common precipitating factors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1725917\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The prevalence of this variant in the general population is not well known. Symptoms suggestive of sexsomnia were reported by 8 percent of a cohort of 832 patients presenting to a sleep disorders clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a systematic review of medical-legal cases involving sleep-related abnormal sexual behavior, affected individuals were largely male, while victims were usually female and, in most cases, minors in close physical proximity (eg, sleeping in the same bed, room, or home) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1725886\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleep terrors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep terrors (also referred to as night terrors or pavor nocturnus) are characterized by a sudden arousal from sleep associated with sitting up in bed, intense fear, a piercing scream, and intense autonomic activation including tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, facial flushing, and mydriasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104443 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Affected individuals appear frightened and confused and are inconsolable and difficult to arouse. They typically have no recollection of events the following morning. In contrast to children, adults typically present with explosive episodes during which they may bolt out of bed in a violent or agitated manner and have partial dream recollection after the event. Episodes typically last several minutes and are followed by the individual calmly and quietly returning to sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1725892\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleepwalking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleepwalking (somnambulism) is characterized by a sequence of complex behaviors in sleep, including ambulation that is more elaborate and seemingly goal-directed than what is seen with confusional arousals. Episodes begin with a confusional arousal that is followed by the individual leaving the bed. Ambulation is typically slow and quiet, with the eyes open. More agitated behaviors, such as running, jumping, vocalization, and other automatic or purposeless behaviors, occasionally occur. Preparing foods, eating, cleaning, rearranging furniture, driving, and inappropriate behaviors such as urinating in a closet may be observed.</p><p>Episodes usually terminate spontaneously with the patient waking up in a different location or returning to bed without incident. Patients appear confused and can be agitated or aggressive when aroused. Self-injury is not uncommon. Violent acts, including homicide and sexual molestation, have been reported. Complete amnesia is typical, although some patients have partial recollection of their behavior.</p><p>Episode frequency varies, ranging from isolated, rare occurrences to multiple events per night for several nights followed by prolonged remission. Higher episode frequency has been associated with earlier onset of sleepwalking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1725898\"><span class=\"h4\">Sleep-related eating disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) (sleep eating) is a variant of sleepwalking characterized by recurrent episodes of involuntary eating associated with diminished levels of consciousness during an arousal from sleep and not linked to daytime eating disturbances such as bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or anorexia nervosa.</p><p>Formal criteria for SRED also specify that the recurrent episodes of eating and drinking during the main sleep period must be accompanied by consumption of inedible or toxic substances (eg, high caloric processed foods, frozen foods, cat food, cigarettes, or cleaning solutions), insomnia, sleep-related injury, occurrence of dangerous behaviors in the search for or while cooking food, morning anorexia, or adverse health consequences from recurrent binge eating of high caloric food, including weight gain, metabolic disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia), hypertension, and OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Like sleepwalking, episodes typically occur in the first one-third of the sleep period. This disorder generally presents in young adulthood and preferentially affects females. In a study that compared the clinical and polysomnographic features of SRED with sleepwalking and controls, patients with SRED were more likely to be female, to have a disease onset in adulthood, and to have nightly episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Common comorbid symptoms included insomnia, anxiety, daytime sleepiness, past or current sleepwalking (two-thirds), and former or current eating behavior problems.</p><p>The absent or diminished level of awareness during the nocturnal food intake is the primary feature distinguishing SRED from eating disorders and nocturnal eating syndrome, a disorder characterized by excessive eating between dinner and bedtime or following complete awakening from sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Psychotropic medications, including sedative-hypnotics, have been implicated in some cases of SRED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition to sleepwalking, sleep disorders associated with SRED include OSA, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), circadian rhythm disorders, narcolepsy, and restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis-Ekbom</span> disease <span class=\"nowrap\">(RLS/WED)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1819283068\" class=\"local\">'Common precipitating factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819283068\"><span class=\"h2\">Common precipitating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders of arousal are often provoked or exacerbated by sleep deprivation, recovery from sleep deprivation (due to slow wave sleep rebound), or physical and emotional stress. Other precipitants include fever, menses, environmental stimuli, and internal stimuli such as bladder distention. Comorbid sleep disorders, particularly OSA and periodic limb movements, can provoke or exacerbate episodes by way of increasing number of arousals from sleep.</p><p>A variety of medications and substances can precipitate events, including alcohol, psychotropic medications (eg, anticholinergics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, antipsychotics), and sedative-hypnotic agents, most notably the nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a>. In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration strengthened warnings on the risk of complex sleep behaviors for sedative-hypnotic agents as a class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Additional data suggests that SRED is more common in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED,</span> potentially related to use of hypnotics to help address sleep-onset insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In the setting of nonbenzodiazepines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a>, behaviors are often prolonged and can include eating, sexual activity, and driving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Supratherapeutic doses or drug-drug interactions have been implicated in many, but not all, reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819283158\"><span class=\"h2\">Polysomnographic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrographic features of disorders of arousal are more variable and less definitive than those associated with seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Whereas seizure patterns typically evolve in frequency, field, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> amplitude, disordered arousals are characterized by generalized hypersynchronous delta waves with superimposed faster frequencies without considerable evolution.</p><p>The arousal itself can consist of any frequency, including rhythmic delta activity suggestive of a persistent sleep pattern or a predominance of alpha activity that is more widespread and less reactive than the waking background, suggestive of partial wakefulness. Electroencephalogram (EEG) state dissociation, with a posteriorly dominant alpha rhythm and anterior delta activity combined with vertex waves or sleep spindles (consistent with light sleep), has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. An increase in delta power immediately preceding the arousal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increase in slow wave sleep percentage across the sleep period may also be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The history should be obtained from the patient as well as from relevant observers, as patients often have little or no memory of the events. (See <a href=\"#H1819283097\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to the event description, the history should include questions about personal and family history of similar events in childhood, sleep deprivation, symptoms of other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), medications, and other factors that may be contributing to the emergence of events. (See <a href=\"#H1819283068\" class=\"local\">'Common precipitating factors'</a> above.) </p><p>When the clinical history is atypical or there is suspicion for a comorbid sleep disorder such as OSA or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), polysomnography (PSG) with expanded electromyographic (EMG) montage should be performed. For patients with suspected nocturnal seizures, a PSG with expanded electroencephalography (EEG) is recommended. Additional indications for PSG in patients with suspected disorders of arousal are listed in the table and include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103096\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103096 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potentially injurious night behaviors or behaviors otherwise disruptive to the bed partner or household members</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daytime symptoms such as excessive sleepiness, since sleepiness is not usually the result of a parasomnia, per se</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disruption out of proportion to what would be expected based on the frequency of nocturnal events</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to respond to appropriate therapy</p><p/><p>The diagnostic yield of PSG with EEG in adults with suspected disorders of arousal is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 124 consecutive patients referred for PSG for the evaluation of a suspected disorder of arousal, the utility of PSG varied significantly based on the history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When the clinical history was typical for a disorder of arousal, PSG rarely identified a different sleep disorder or unsuspected precipitant (5 percent, respectively). When the diagnosis was not clinically obvious or the history had unusual features, however, the yield of PSG was higher: other sleep diagnoses were identified in 18 percent of patients and potential precipitants were identified in 24 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 100 adults with a history of sleep-related injury, PSG combined with EEG provided conclusive diagnostic information in 65 percent of cases and was helpful in another 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].
