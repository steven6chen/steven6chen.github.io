The obstruction can occur at several different locations, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Valvar PS</strong> &ndash; Valvar stenosis is the most common type of PS, and is typically characterized by fused or absent commissures with thickened leaflets of the pulmonary valve.

The closer the click to the first heart sound, the more severe the PS, until it merges with the first heart sound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-subvalvar-and-supravalvar-pulmonic-stenosis-ps-and-peripheral-pulmonic-stenosis-pps-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The click corresponds to the time when the doming pulmonary valve reaches its open position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The split between the second heart sounds is dependent on the severity of the obstruction. The more the severity increases, the longer it takes the RV to empty and the wider is the splitting. The second component (pulmonary) is also decreased, and proportionally lower as the pressure in the pulmonary artery decreases in more severe PS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristic murmur of valvar PS is a systolic ejection murmur heard at the second left intercostal space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104796\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104796 \">movie 2</a>). In general, the intensity of the murmur increases with the severity of the obstruction. Of note, in neonates with severe PS, the murmur may be very soft as a result of the decreased flow through the pulmonary valve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In more severe cases, a thrill is palpable at the second and third intercostal space.</p><p/><p>In the setting of supravalvar and subvalvar PS, a systolic ejection murmur is also noted at the second left intercostal space, whereas in patients with peripheral PS, there is a systolic ejection murmur, which can be heard in the back. If the obstruction is bilateral, the murmur can be found equally loud over the chest and back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H626097291\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients undergo initial testing with electrocardiography (ECG) and chest radiography.

In patients with moderate or severe disease, there is almost always a right axis deviation and findings of RV hypertrophy (eg, larger R waves in the right chest leads) in proportion to the severity of RVOT obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91514\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef91514 \">waveform 1</a>). In infants older than 24 hours of age, upright T waves in the right chest leads may be observed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609331712\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic features also vary depending on the severity of the obstruction. Chest radiographs in PS may demonstrate an enlarged cardiac silhouette, most commonly in severe cases, and occasionally dilated pulmonary arteries can also be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91513\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91513 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H626097297\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PS is usually suspected based on a cardiac examination that identifies the distinctive characteristics of PS (normal first sound accompanied by an audible click, a split second sound, and a systolic ejection murmur at the second left intercostal space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104796\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104796 \">movie 2</a>)). However, the diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography, as even experienced pediatric cardiologists may miss making a diagnosis of PS based on clinical examination alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-subvalvar-and-supravalvar-pulmonic-stenosis-ps-and-peripheral-pulmonic-stenosis-pps-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

There is good correlation between the Doppler-derived gradient and that obtained by direct catheterization measurements. However, the maximum instantaneous gradient measured by Doppler echocardiography can overestimate the catheter gradient by 20 to 30 mmHg, whereas the mean gradient may be an underestimation of the peak to peak gradient obtained from catheterization.</p><p>Echocardiography is also the test of choice to diagnose cases of subvalvar and supravalvar PS, and those of peripheral PS that involve the major pulmonary arteries. However, echocardiography may have more difficulty detecting distal branch pulmonary artery stenosis.

However, in some cases in which the diagnosis remains uncertain (eg, patients with PPS involving distal branch arteries), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) are useful noninvasive imaging modalities that provide excellent visualization of the pulmonary artery (PA) architecture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-subvalvar-and-supravalvar-pulmonic-stenosis-ps-and-peripheral-pulmonic-stenosis-pps-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

There are several different levels at which obstruction can occur (see <a href=\"#H626097243\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Valvar PS is the most common variant, in which stenosis occurs at the level of the pulmonary valve, which typically is characterized by a dome-shaped valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91425\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef91425 \">movie 1</a>). Dysplastic pulmonary valves are a less common form of valvar PS, often seen in patients with Noonan syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subvalvar PS is uncommon and is usually caused by primary fibromuscular narrowing below the pulmonary valve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Supravalvar PS is caused by a discrete narrowing of the main PA, located just above the pulmonary valve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peripheral PS is caused by peripheral discrete areas of narrowing in the pulmonary arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PS can be isolated or be associated with other cardiac lesions including double-outlet right ventricle, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallot, and both D- and L-transposition of the great arteries. In addition, several syndromes are associated with PS including Noonan, Alagille, Williams-Beuren, and congenital rubella syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H609327867\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because PS results in right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, the RV pressure needed to overcome the obstruction rises as the severity of the obstruction increases, resulting in a higher pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve, which is usually determined by echocardiography. The pressure gradient defines the severity of obstruction and is used to make management decisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114535\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114535 \">table 1</a>).
