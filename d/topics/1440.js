The two factors that are most important in determining a patient's prognosis and potential treatment options are tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">mass/location</span> and the patient's hepatic reserve. Patients with unresectable tumors who do not fulfill criteria for liver transplantation are typically managed with nonsurgical locoregional therapy (percutaneous needle-based ablation techniques, transarterial therapies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy [RT]) or systemic therapy (molecularly targeted agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> or conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy).

Accurate assessment of response requires evaluation of tumor size and other features, including the ablative margin, tumor viability and vascularity (as reflected by contrast enhancement), and early detection of <span class=\"nowrap\">residual/recurrent</span> tumor and new areas of tumor involvement.</p><p>This topic review will cover the alternative methods of tumor assessment used for HCC that is treated either by nonsurgical local means or systemic therapy. Antitumor efficacy of specific nonsurgical locoregional treatments and systemic therapy is covered elsewhere.

However, attempts to generate algorithmic approaches to the treatment of HCC are difficult since new treatments and indications for various treatments are evolving rapidly. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches tend to vary based upon the available expertise, as well as variability in the criteria for hepatic resection and liver transplantation. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, the optimal treatment for early stage HCC is surgical resection or liver transplantation. Patients with unresectable tumors that are outside of usual criteria for liver transplantation (the Milan criteria) are typically managed with nonsurgical locoregional therapy or systemic therapy. Nonsurgical locoregional therapy may also be used as a bridge to liver transplantation or to downstage tumors that initially exceed usual transplantation criteria.

The choice of nonsurgical treatment modality is empiric and influenced by tumor size, location, local expertise, and institutional practice. Few trials have directly compared any of the available therapies with one another, and there is little consensus as to when one modality should be chosen over another. In general, hepatic arterial embolization is reserved for treatment of an unresectable HCC that is either too large or multifocal for percutaneous ablation techniques, such as RFA or stereotactic RT, as long as liver function is relatively well-preserved, and there is no extrahepatic tumor spread, vascular invasion, or main portal vein thrombus.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H524732010\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES FOR ASSESSMENT OF TREATMENT RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Response assessment of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is a requirement for clinical evaluation of the effect of locoregional and systemic therapies, and for use as end points in clinical trials as a surrogate for survival. The gold standard for response to therapy is pathological evaluation of tissue. However, this is impractical as it is invasive and can have both false positive and false negative results, depending upon site of biopsy. Radiographic imaging offers a noninvasive, robust, and very accessible method of evaluation of tumor response.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically the efficacy of nonsurgical local ablation therapy is assessed by dynamic computed tomography (CT) or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) one month after therapy and every three to six months thereafter. In general, MRI is preferred over CT due to its inherent superior tissue contrast resolution and sensitivity for detection of both the lesion and associated posttreatment changes. MRI is also beneficial for patients who have an allergy to iodinated contrast and for those who have undergone ethiodized oil (Lipiodol)-based therapies. (See <a href=\"#H524732206\" class=\"local\">'MRI'</a> below and <a href=\"#H610037953\" class=\"local\">'Response after locoregional therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving systemic therapy, reimaging is typically carried out using cross-sectional imaging after the initial six to eight weeks of therapy, and then every two to three months thereafter.

There is no clear evidence of superiority of MRI over CT for assessing HCC response to therapy. MRI may be preferred for individuals with acute or chronic kidney injury, those who are allergic to intravenous iodinated contrast, and for follow-up of patients treated with Lipiodol-based transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H524732075\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast-enhanced CT is the most common radiographic modality used for diagnosis of HCC and follow-up after therapy. The ability of CT to detect HCC has improved with the development of helical CT technology, which involves the rapid administration of intravenous contrast in combination with extremely fast imaging. Multiphase contrast-enhanced thin-slice (multidetector row) helical CT (MDCT) is now the most common scanner type for CT evaluation. Thin section images allow multiplanar reconstruction, and the liver can be imaged in a single breath-hold, providing good quality images.</p><p>The characteristic appearance of an HCC on MDCT includes tumoral uptake of contrast in the late hepatic arterial phase of contrast enhancement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73767\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73767 \">image 1</a>), washout during the later (portal venous) phase, and peripheral &quot;rim&quot; contrast enhancement. Some tumors are isoattenuating on both arterial and portal phase imaging, and may be missed; the addition of delayed venous phase imaging improves their detection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The usual protocol for patients undergoing treatment for HCC is a quadruple-phase contrast-enhanced CT with unenhanced images (to allow characterization of residual posttreatment enhancement), a single late arterial phase based on a bolus-tracking method (for accurate peak arterial enhancement), a portal venous phase at 60 or 70 seconds after iodinated contrast injection at a rate of 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/s,</span> and a late venous phase (&ge;120 seconds) after iodinated contrast injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The CT appearance of treated HCC is discussed in detail below.

DECT provides a higher temporal resolution and can provide an iodine map with virtual nonenhanced images, which decreases radiation dose as it eliminates the need for nonenhanced image acquisition.</p><p>DECT increases detection of hypervascular lesions, such as HCC, and it may improve characterization of indeterminate subcentimeter lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. DECT may also have utility in evaluating HCC response to locoregional therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), because of a higher lesion-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio on iodine maps, aiding in the detection of residual tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, further studies are needed before the use of DECT in this setting is considered routine.</p><p>CT perfusion imaging (CTP) is an advanced technique for the evaluation of tumor vascular physiology. It is acquired by applying mathematical kinetic models, such as compartmental or deconvolution analysis for contrast material exchange, on the temporal changes in attenuation of a dynamic contrast-enhanced CT. The parameters used in CTP are blood volume, mean transit time, and permeability surface area product. Blood volume deals with the volume of blood within a tumor and the normal background, mean transit time provides information about the transit time of blood from the artery to the vein through the tumor, and permeability surface area product gives information about the total flux from plasma to interstitial space in the tumor. At least some data suggest promise for CTP in monitoring response to TACE and systemic antiangiogenic therapy in HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, as with DECT, further studies are needed before the use of CTP in this setting is considered routine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H524732206\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with CT, MRI has the advantage of achieving high-resolution images of the liver without the use of nephrotoxic contrast agents or ionizing radiation. On contrast-enhanced MRI, HCC appears as a high-intensity pattern on T2-weighted images and a low intensity pattern on T1-weighted images, often with an enhancing capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F75007\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75007 \">image 2</a>). The characteristic appearance of HCC on contrast-enhanced MRI is arterial phase hyperenhancement, with subsequent washout on portal or delayed phases, lower signal intensity in the hepatobiliary phase (when gadoxetic acid is used), and rim (pseudocapsule) enhancement.</p><p>Our institution uses the following protocol for liver evaluation on MRI: coronal fast spin echo T2-weighted images (which enhances T2 differences between tissues), axial fast spin echo T2-weighted images with and without chemical presaturation to reduce signal from fat (FAT SAT), axial gradient recalled echo (GRE; which allows images to be acquired rapidly in a single breath hold), in-phase and opposed-phase T1-weighted image, and axial 3D FAT-SAT GRE T1-weighted imaging before and after dynamic injection of an extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The volumetric T1-weighted imaging sequence is the most important sequence for HCC detection and characterization. Acquisitions are performed at the hepatic arterial phase using either a test bolus of contrast material or a bolus-tracking method for accurate timing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The portal venous phase is at one minute after contrast injection, late venous or equilibrium phase at three minutes (for gadoxetic acid), and hepatobiliary phase at 10 or 20 minutes (for gadoxetic acid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The added value of liver-specific gadoxetic acid (Eovist) over extracellular GBCAs to assess response after locoregional therapy of HCC is unclear. One study suggested no benefit for the detection of local recurrence after RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], whereas another study comparing CT with gadoxetic acid&ndash;enhanced MRI after RFA showed higher inter-observer agreement and a better performance in general for MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The added potential value of gadoxetic acid may be in the differentiation of small areas of viable tumor from &quot;pseudolesions&quot; seen during the arterial phase by assessing washout on the late venous phase or hypointensity in the hepatobiliary phase (which reflects the lack of functioning hepatocytes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the contrast kinetics of gadoxetic acid are such that the arterial phase lacks the robustness of gadolinium, and this may compromise the identification of new lesions.</p><p>For patients being assessed after RFA or TACE, image subtraction techniques are used in every patient. This is helpful because without subtraction, posttreatment coagulative hemorrhagic necrosis tends to be bright on precontrast (unenhanced) T1-weighted imaging, leading to difficulty in evaluation of postcontrast tumor enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, unlike CT, in which the beam-hardening effects of high-attenuation Lipiodol may obscure small enhancing tumors, Lipiodol does not adversely affect MRI signal-intensity characteristics, so residual enhancement can be detected, especially when image subtraction is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F99602\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99602 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The MRI appearance of treated HCC is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H610037953\" class=\"local\">'Response after locoregional therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Contrast-enhanced dynamic T1-weighted imaging with diffusion-weighted MRI is a type of functional imaging that can also be advantageous in assessing treatment-related changes in HCC and is superior to contrast-enhanced CT after Lipiodol-based TACE therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,18</a>].</p><p>Diffusion-weighted imaging with MRI is a technique that derives its imaging contrast on the basis of differences in the mobility of extracellular protons in tissues. Diffusion is a physical process that results from the thermally driven random motion of water molecules. The signal of a diffusion-weighted MRI is proportional to the compactness of the cells, which in turn means a lack of extracellular space. This is exploited in interrogation of tumors to evaluate cellularity and cell death. This in turn can be an indirect measure of treatment effect. The diffusion characteristics are measured by the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Most institutions do not routinely use diffusion-weighted imaging during MRI scans; however, it is increasingly being incorporated in routine protocols, especially for patients with renal insufficiency who cannot get intravenous contrast. There is some potential for diffusion-weighted imaging for monitoring the response to anti-HCC treatment, but this is not yet a standard approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

It employs analysis of the temporal changes of the contrast agent following intravenous gadolinium injection. There are multiple parameters; the ones used in liver imaging are vascular permeability, reverse reflux rate constant between extracellular space and plasma, and fractional extravascular extracellular space. Early data support potential benefit for MRP in assessing response to systemic antiangiogenic therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

In general, tumor necrosis produces a lack of contrast enhancement in the arterial phase, and enhancement is characteristic of residual disease. As with MRI, one advantage of contrast-enhanced US in patients treated with TACE is that retained Lipiodol in a treated tumor does not interfere with US, while CT evaluation of enhancement in the setting of retained Lipiodol is difficult.

There was an increasing awareness of the need to standardize assessment of response to the expanding number of cytotoxic chemotherapy agents. In 1979, WHO published a handbook of criteria for solid tumors (including HCC) in an attempt to standardize treatment response assessment, summarized in the table and compared with RECIST 1.0 and RECIST 1.1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F99517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99517 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Despite good intentions, the WHO criteria were problematic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The progressive disease category could be easily achieved by chance changes in measurement (eg, a 25 percent increase in the product of two measurements could occur with an approximately 11 percent increase in each dimension) that are well within interindividual and intraindividual variability in measurement by palpation or estimation on plain radiographs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The criteria were not explicit on such factors as how many tumor foci should be measured or minimum size for a lesion to be considered measurable.</p><p/><p>The WHO criteria are still in use in some trials and were the criteria used to define clinical response rates in many important reference trials from the past two decades.

RECIST 1.0 specified the number of target lesions to assess (up to 10), though it did not give substantial guidance on how they were to be selected, except that there should not be more than five per organ. RECIST 1.0 specified that only the single longest dimension of the tumor should be measured (ie, unidimensional measurement), and the sum of these unidimensional measurements was to be used as the metric for determining response. The criteria also specified the minimum size of the lesions to be assessed (typically 1 cm using modern CT with 5 mm or thinner slices).</p><p>Updated RECIST (RECIST 1.1) included several modifications, at least some of which were controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the original RECIST included size measurements of up to 10 lesions, simulations performed using data from several clinical trials found strong agreement in response classifications using fewer lesions (even one) but better concordance with five lesions.

In RECIST 1.1, the short (rather than long) axis of lymph nodes were measured; short-axis dimensions greater than 1.5 cm were considered suitable for measurement, and nodes with short axes &lt;1 cm were considered normal.

Modality wise, either CT or MRI can be used. Intravenous contrast administration is recommended unless medically contraindicated. Dual phase imaging is mandatory, including arterial and portal venous phase. Delayed phase imaging is not mandatory. Multidetector CT acquiring thin, contiguous slices with no reconstruction gap is mandatory. For image interpretation, the panel recommended a &quot;centralized radiologic review&quot; to ensure comparability across studies. Uniform image acquisition parameters, rigorous quality control, and independent blinded multireader assessment is mandatory. Independent radiologists will assess the baseline imaging and follow-up imaging according to mRECIST.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At baseline, tumors are characterized as measurable (lesion accurately measured in at least one dimension equal to or greater than 1 cm) or nonmeasurable (all other lesions, lesions smaller than 1 cm). Importantly, mRECIST criteria can only be used for typical hypervascular HCC and not for atypical HCC, including poorly differentiated HCC and diffuse-type HCC. For these nonenhancing atypical lesions, standard RECIST criteria are used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74693 \">table 3</a>). HCC lesions that were treated in the past with locoregional or systemic treatments may or may not be considered suitable targets for mRECIST; if the lesion shows a well-defined area of arterial enhancement, which correlates with viable tumor, and is at least 1 cm in the longest dimension, it can be considered a target lesion. Lesions showing atypical enhancement with poor delineation due to prior treatment cannot be selected for mRECIST evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lesions that can be selected as a target lesion as per mRECIST should meet the following criteria:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They can be classified as a RECIST measurable lesion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They are suitable for repeat measurement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They show intratumoral arterial enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Definitions of treatment response and tumor progression</strong> &ndash; As outlined in the table, these are classified as target lesion response, nontarget lesion response, and new lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58792 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Target lesion response is classified as complete response, partial response, progressive disease, and stable disease. Following treatment, likely due to necrosis, viable tumor measurement can be a challenge. Arterial phase measurement of CT or MRI was recommended since the contrast between the viable and nonenhancing necrotic area is highest at this time. Measure the longest diameter of viable tumor without any intervening major area of necrosis. It should be mentioned that the longest diameter of enhancement on posttreatment scans may not be in the same plane as the baseline measurement. The panel mentioned that volumetric assessment should be a priority for future research, since there is a 138 percent difference in tumor volume between partial response (at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions, amounting to a 65 percent change in volume) and progressive disease (increase of at least 20 percent in the diameter of the viable tumor, amounting to a 73 percent change in volume). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For nontarget lesions, persistent enhancement in even one lesion should be considered an incomplete response or stable disease, and a lack of contrast enhancement is consistent with a complete response. Appearance of even one new lesion or unequivocal progression of the older nontarget lesion should be called progressive disease. Some nontarget lesions (eg, malignant portal vein thrombus) are considered nonmeasurable. For a porta hepatis lymph node to be considered malignant, it should measure at least 20 mm in the short axis. In patients showing worsening of ascites or pleural effusion who have otherwise met criteria of response or stable disease, the nature of <span class=\"nowrap\">ascites/pleural</span> effusion should be confirmed by cytopathology. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A newly detected hepatic nodule is classified as HCC (and declared evidence of progression) when its longest diameter is at least 1 cm and the nodule has a typical vascular pattern on dynamic imaging (hypervascular in arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or late venous phase). Liver lesions &gt;1 cm that do not show a typical vascular pattern can be diagnosed as HCC if there is at least 1 cm of interval growth on subsequent scans. An individual radiologic event will be called disease progression in retrospect at the time the lesion was first detected, even if the lesion fulfilled the criteria on subsequent imaging scans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overall response assessment</strong> &ndash; Similar to conventional RECIST, mRECIST defines overall patient response as a result of the combined assessment of the target lesions, nontarget lesions, and new lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58792 \">table 2</a>). Appearance of any new lesion equates to disease progression, irrespective of the target and nontarget lesion's response to therapy. Thus, strict criteria should be enforced, and any lesion not meeting strict criteria should be considered equivocal and not conclusive for disease progression.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436795600\"><span class=\"h3\">Choi criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, a molecularly targeted agent used in treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), is often characterized by an early decrease in tumor density followed by slow tumor regression.

These patterns of response and disease progression are not well captured by standard dimensional measurements. This prompted Choi et al to develop an alternative set of response evaluation criteria, the so-called Choi criteria, based upon studies showing that a 10 percent decrease in unidimensional tumor size or a 15 percent decrease in tumor density on contrast-enhanced CT scans (as reflected by differences in radiography attenuation between a given material and water, expressed in Hounsfield units) correlates well with positron emission tomography (PET) scan findings and is a better predictor of response to therapy (as judged by time to tumor progression) than standard RECIST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

Therefore, quantification of <span class=\"nowrap\">necrosis/tumor</span> viability rather than size measurement appears to be a better method of treatment response assessment in HCC treated with these biologic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer/abstract/34,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,115</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H850019\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate response assessment of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is a requirement for clinical evaluation of the effect of nonsurgical locoregional and systemic therapies, and for use as end points in clinical trials as a surrogate for survival. Cross-sectional imaging with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a noninvasive, robust, and very accessible method of evaluation of tumor response (see <a href=\"#H524732010\" class=\"local\">'Techniques for assessment of treatment response'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Typically the efficacy of nonsurgical local ablation therapy is assessed by dynamic CT or contrast-enhanced MRI one month after therapy and every three to six months thereafter. In general, MRI is preferred over CT due to its inherent superior tissue contrast resolution and sensitivity for detection of both the lesion and associated posttreatment changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients receiving systemic therapy, assessment for tumor response is typically carried out using cross-sectional imaging after the initial six to eight weeks of therapy, and then every two to three months thereafter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In either situation, for the subset of patients with an elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), this marker can be useful to follow response; elevations may precede radiographic imaging changes of progression by several weeks or months. (See <a href=\"#H524732851\" class=\"local\">'Tumor markers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard methods to classify treatment response that are based upon radiographic studies (eg, unidimensional Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 [RECIST 1.1]) involve measurement of tumor dimensions on cross-sectional imaging before and after treatment. Methods such as these disregard tumor viability and the extent of necrosis, which is the end result of locoregional ablative therapies, and may precede a change in measurable dimensions. Furthermore, many systemic therapies in HCC are cytostatic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>), leading to little change in tumor size. (See <a href=\"#H436793246\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic-based methods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formal classification systems for response assessment of HCC that incorporate estimated reductions in tumor viability are preferred for classifying responses to nonsurgical locoregional therapies and systemic chemotherapy for hypervascular tumors. The absence of contrast uptake within the tumor is thought to reflect tumor necrosis, while the persistence of contrast uptake indicates persistent disease. Recurrence of tumor in the treated area (or elsewhere) is signaled by the reappearance of vascular enhancement. (See <a href=\"#H436793446\" class=\"local\">'Classification systems that incorporate tumor viability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two are available, and neither can be recommended over the other:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>EASL &ndash; Guidelines from the European Association for Study of the Liver (EASL) suggest that estimated reductions in viable tumor burden using dynamic imaging techniques be incorporated into definitions for response in this setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F99517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99517 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H436794110\" class=\"local\">'EASL criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Modified RECIST (mRECIST) for HCC &ndash; Others have proposed a modification of the RECIST criteria for HCC, which parallels the definitions of conventional RECIST and measures the amount of residual viable tumor tissue by summing the length of the remnant viable parts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58792 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H436793566\" class=\"local\">'Modified RECIST for HCC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, mRECIST criteria can only be used for typical hypervascular HCC and not for atypical HCC, including poorly differentiated HCC and diffuse-type HCC. For these nonenhancing atypical lesions, standard RECIST 1.1 guidelines are used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patterns of response to treatment with immunotherapy differ from those with molecularly targeted agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Patients may appear to have a transient worsening of disease, manifested either by progression of known lesions or the appearance of new lesions, before disease stabilizes or regresses. In addition, responses can take appreciably longer to become apparent compared with cytotoxic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy#H280928298\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Patterns of response'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Immune-related response criteria have been proposed to properly recognize the nontraditional patterns of response occasionally seen with checkpoint inhibitors and some other immunotherapies. (See <a href=\"#H1513262194\" class=\"local\">'Response criteria for immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend dynamic (contrast-enhanced) cross-sectional imaging with either CT or MRI four to eight weeks after the start of systemic therapy or after nonsurgical locoregional therapy, then continued monitoring every three months for at least the first two years. Thereafter, either cross-sectional imaging or ultrasound (US) could be performed every six months. Although not entirely reliable, the absence of contrast uptake within the tumor is thought to reflect tumor necrosis, while the persistence of contrast uptake generally indicates persistent disease. (See <a href=\"#H610037811\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines for posttreatment imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with ethiodized oil (Lipiodol), MRI may be preferred over CT because of the potential interference of Lipiodol with arterial phase contrast enhancement during CT. (See <a href=\"#H524732206\" class=\"local\">'MRI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following ablation with radiofrequency or microwaves, residual viable tumor or tumor regrowth is most often detected at the periphery of the treated lesion, either as irregular thickening at the margin or as a new tumor nodule. By MRI, increased signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging or restriction on diffusion-weighted MRI with associated nodular enhancement is characteristic of an incompletely treated tumor. (See <a href=\"#H610038069\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radiographic responses may be delayed in patients treated with selective internal radiation therapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients treated with systemic multikinase inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>, quantification of <span class=\"nowrap\">necrosis/tumor</span> viability, rather than size measurement, appears to be a better method of treatment response assessment.
