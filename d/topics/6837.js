(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radial head subluxation (nursemaid's elbow)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2452967771\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An immobile arm is a relatively common complaint in pediatrics evaluated in both the emergency department and primary care provider office. An infant or child is not moving the limb either due to current or recently resolved pain or weakness and can be considered to have an upper extremity equivalent of a &quot;limp&quot;. Since many of these children are preverbal and fearful of strangers, the evaluation may be challenging. Radial head subluxation (&quot;nursemaid's elbow&quot;) is by far the most common cause of arm immobility in children younger than six years of age, however, children with much more serious pathology may present with this complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-immobile-arm-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By using historical information, physical findings, selective radiologic studies, and laboratory tests, children with an immobile arm can be appropriately diagnosed and managed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005537\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An immobile arm most frequently results from radial head subluxation or an injury after a fall. The causes of an immobile arm are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87861\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87861 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005545\"><span class=\"h2\">Life and limb-threatening causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although these causes of an immobile arm are presented first and should always be considered, other than trauma, they are quite rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005552\"><span class=\"h3\">Complicated fracture or dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with fractures or dislocations typically present with a history of trauma and have focal tenderness, swelling, or deformity. Although uncommon, associated neurovascular compromise or an open fracture may be present and require emergent intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midshaft-humeral-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Midshaft humeral fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of supracondylar fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87050670\"><span class=\"h3\">Child abuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the preverbal child, the history of trauma may be absent either because it was unwitnessed or inflicted by a caretaker who is not forthcoming. Careful physical examination of the child often identifies other signs of inflicted trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109402 \">table 2</a>). In addition, inflicted fractures may have characteristic findings on radiographs. Identifying inflicted injuries is crucial to preventing further, potentially more serious injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthopedic aspects of child abuse&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005574\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone or joint infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone or joint infections are an uncommon cause of immobile arm. Patients often (but not uniformly) have associated history of fever. The onset of arm disuse is often less abrupt than with trauma. There is frequently associated paradoxical irritability (increased crying when being held), localized swelling, warmth and tenderness; infected joints usually have limited, painful range of motion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial arthritis: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Clinical features and complications&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5832605\"><span class=\"h3\">Necrotizing cellulitis or fasciitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Necrotizing soft tissue infections in children are most commonly caused by group A streptococcus; other agents include s. aureus and anaerobic organisms. Predisposing factors include skin trauma (eg, laceration, burn, surgery) and varicella, although skin may be intact. Children are usually febrile and toxic and the affected area is typically erythematous (without sharp borders), swollen, warm, shiny and exquisitely tender, often with pain out of proportion to the physical exam findings. Advanced cases may show blue-gray skin with cutaneous gangrene. Compartment syndrome and complicating myonecrosis may occur and CPK is often elevated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections#H650406663\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;, section on 'Necrotizing fasciitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections#H2611694952\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005588\"><span class=\"h3\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stroke is a rare cause of arm weakness in children and typically presents with abrupt onset of hemiparesis (rather than isolated arm paresis). Although stroke may affect the arm more than the leg, suggesting a monoplegia, careful examination may reveal mild leg weakness, deep tendon reflex abnormalities or extensor plantar response. Stoke may also be associated with headache, seizure, altered mental status or speech difficulty. Children with sickle cell disease, structural cardiac disease, and coagulation disorders are predisposed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-and-young-adults-etiology-and-clinical-features#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children and young adults: Etiology and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Etiologies and risk factors in children'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005603\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor or malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, a child with a neoplasm or malignancy may have decreased arm movement due to pain, either from tumors of bone, cartilage or muscle, or from neoplastic infiltration of the bone marrow. Associated pathologic fractures may be present. Typically less abrupt in onset, there may be a history of fever, malaise, or weight loss and localized tenderness or swelling may be present. With leukemia or neuroblastoma, abdominal mass, hepatosplenomegaly or pathologic adenopathy may be present. Rarely, tumors impinge on nerves or the brachial plexus, causing weakness (with or without pain) as the presenting symptom.

The classic mechanism involves a sudden pull of the arm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86688\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86688 \">figure 1</a>). However, almost half of injuries are caused by other mechanisms including falling and twisting, and it is not uncommon to have no history of trauma. The child with RHS typically holds the affected arm slightly flexed (often in the lap) with the forearm pronated and without spontaneous arm movement. The child is usually not distressed unless the elbow is moved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82235 \">figure 2</a>). There is typically no reproducible tenderness, warmth or swelling (best evaluated while distracting the child). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radial head subluxation (nursemaid's elbow)&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005632\"><span class=\"h3\">Fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fracture of the clavicle or arm may lead to arm disuse. In the neonate, this may be due to a difficult delivery. In the child there is typically a history of trauma with moderate to severe pain and examination reveals local swelling and tenderness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clavicle-fractures#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clavicle fractures&quot;, section on 'Pediatric considerations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midshaft-humeral-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Midshaft humeral fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of supracondylar fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005639\"><span class=\"h3\">Soft tissue injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with soft tissue injuries usually present with a history of trauma and may have swelling, tenderness, or a contusion on exam. If obtained, radiographs show no bony abnormality. Rarely, direct neurologic injury may cause neurologic deficits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005674\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005682\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemoglobinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with sickle cell disease may present with decreased arm use because of stroke or vasoocclusive crisis, causing ischemia or infarction of bone marrow with acute bone pain. Long bones are commonly affected; however, young children frequently have involvement of the small bones of the hands and feet (dactylitis). Usually, no precipitating events are identified. The child typically has pain with localized tenderness and may have swelling of the involved areas. There may be associated warmth. If febrile, it is important to consider septic arthritis and osteomyelitis as children with sickle cell disease are susceptible to infection, and the clinical findings may overlap with bone infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Acute painful episodes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H4039440923\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Stroke and TIA'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005689\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflammatory process</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonseptic arthritis may cause decreased arm use, and can be due to rheumatologic diseases, postinfectious causes, or, less commonly in the upper extremity, Lyme disease. In addition to a swollen, tender joint, children with inflammatory arthritis often have other findings of systemic disease including multiple joint involvement, rash, fever, adenopathy, heart murmur, hematuria or bloody stools. If the examination suggests an inflammatory arthritis but cannot exclude a septic process, then arthrocentesis is necessary for definitive diagnosis. Rarely, myositis (due to infection, injury, autoimmune or drug) can cause localized muscle tenderness and weakness leading to arm disuse.

Associated clinical findings may include hepatosplenomegaly, syphilitic rhinitis (&quot;snuffles&quot;), maculopapular rash, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Long bone films and serologic tests for syphilis can establish the diagnosis.

The child will typically have a history of a bleeding disorder (although not with the first presentation) and may or may not have a history of trauma. The affected joint is swollen and tender with limited range of motion but there is typically no fever or other systemic symptoms.

Their examination is often illogical both anatomically and physiologically. Discontinuous resistance during testing of power or give-way weakness may exist. Muscle wasting is absent, and reflexes are normal. Conversion disorder should be diagnosed only after organic causes have been ruled out. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis#H1954453\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conversion disorder in adults: Terminology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005710\"><span class=\"h3\">Complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) have pain to light touch and decreased movement that typically occurs in a single extremity (more commonly lower). There may or may not be history of preceding trauma. Onset of disuse and pain is usually less abrupt than with trauma, worsens over time and is unimproved or worsened by immobilization. Children with CRPS often have associated decreased skin temperature, edema and cyanosis, with some exhibiting hyperhidrosis. Erythema and fever are typically absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005717\"><span class=\"h3\">Other neurologic conditions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556738\"><span class=\"h4\">Todd paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Todd paralysis is a transient focal weakness that occurs after a seizure. The paralysis may be partial or complete. It is typically unilateral and although often a hemiparesis, it may be more prominent in one extremity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of seizures in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Behavior after the event'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005725\"><span class=\"h4\">Complex migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal motor deficits, usually hemiplegia, may occur during a classic migraine attack. The evolution of symptoms is variable but often includes scotomas, unilateral dysesthesias of the hand and mouth and unilateral weakness (may involve only the arm and face, sparing the leg). These non-headache symptoms may precede the headache by 30 to 60 minutes. Other features of migraine are often present, and typically include a throbbing frontotemporal headache contralateral to the affected hemisphere, as well as nausea and vomiting. The neurologic symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. First episodes of hemiplegic migraine should only be diagnosed after other causes of acute stroke have been excluded by brain imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-migraine-in-children#H698850692\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of migraine in children&quot;, section on 'Hemiplegic migraine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005746\"><span class=\"h4\">Brachial plexus pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachial plexus abnormalities are unusual causes of an immobile arm. Typical etiologies are determined by patient age as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neonatal brachial neuropathy</strong> &ndash; Brachial plexus injuries in the newborn are caused by excessive traction during delivery. Erb palsy involves the upper roots <span class=\"nowrap\">(C5/6),</span> causing the arm to be adducted and internally rotated, elbow extended, forearm pronated, and wrist flexed with preservation of hand movement. Klumpke palsy, an injury to the lower roots <span class=\"nowrap\">(C8/T1)</span> is much rarer, manifesting as isolated hand paralysis. Severe damage to all C5-T1 roots causes a flail arm and Horner syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachial-plexus-syndromes#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachial plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Neonatal brachial plexus palsy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postnatal brachial neuropathy</strong> &ndash; Although unusual, impairment of the brachial plexus is most often caused by trauma (traction or pressure), although tumor, inflammation or ischemia may rarely be responsible. Onset of symptoms may be acute or insidious and include weakness and pain, less commonly sensory loss. Examination may reveal weakness, atrophy, sensory loss, or diminished reflexes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachial-plexus-syndromes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachial plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Traumatic plexopathies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005772\"><span class=\"h4\">Mononeuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radial, ulnar, or median nerve dysfunction causes weakness or sensory symptoms in the distal regions of innervation and is most commonly due to trauma (fracture or compression). Axillary neuropathy most commonly results from shoulder injury, direct trauma or pressure, and manifestations include numbness of the outer shoulder and deltoid weakness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556926\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005779\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive history helps narrow the extensive list of possible causes in the child with an immobile arm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87861\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87861 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient age</strong> &ndash; Patient age helps narrow the differential diagnosis as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neonates may present with birth complications (clavicle fracture, brachial plexus injury). If not from birth, arm disuse in this patient population and young infants up to one year of age is potentially concerning for significant pathology (eg, central nervous system abnormality, child abuse, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis). It is important to note that infants may not mount a febrile response to infection and may only have nonspecific symptoms (eg, increased sleeping, lethargy, diminished feeding, irritability). Of note, congenital syphilis many cause pseudoparalysis in infants in the one to three month age range with or without fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children one to five years of age most commonly have radial head subluxation (RHS, nursemaid's elbow) or a fracture of the clavicle, humerus, or forearm bones, as the cause of an immobile arm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children older than five years of age and adolescents typically have a fracture or soft tissue injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Onset</strong> &ndash; Acute arm immobility is usually due to trauma although acute onset may occur with some of the rare neurologic causes (eg, complex migraine, Todd paralysis, stroke). Subacute disuse is more typical of infection or a systemic disease such as an inflammatory arthritis, vasoocclusive crisis, or malignancy. If the patient is an infant, it should be determined whether the arm disuse began abruptly at birth, suggesting either brachial plexus injury or clavicle fracture sustained during a difficulty delivery, or more gradually in the first three months of life, as may be seen with pseudoparalysis of Parrot caused by congenital syphilis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma</strong> &ndash; A history of a pull on the arm or trauma is typically present for children with RHS, fracture, or soft tissue injury. Details of the event may provide clues to the type of injury incurred: a fall onto an outstretched hand may cause soft tissue injury (eg, contusion, strain, or sprain) or an elbow, wrist or forearm fracture, whereas a sudden arm pull by a caregiver can cause RHS. It is important to note that many children with RHS may have a mechanism of injury other than traction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pain</strong> &ndash; Pain is present for the majority of diagnoses but may be absent in RHS (if the arm is not moved) and with weakness due to rare neurologic processes. Location and duration of pain are important to elicit and can aid in diagnosing the etiology of the arm immobility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other findings</strong> &ndash; Associated signs and symptoms can help suggest specific etiologies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever, malaise, rash and weight loss can be seen in infectious, inflammatory or oncologic diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of sickle cell disease, bleeding disorder, structural cardiac disease, or underlying inflammatory process (eg, rheumatologic disease) would suggest complications of the underlying illness as a possible etiology of arm disuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Headache, seizure, paresthesias, or weakness would point to a neurologic cause.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005821\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a full physical examination is important for evaluation of the child with arm disuse, examining a young child can prove challenging because they often cry when approached or touched by a stranger. Observation and inspection, sometimes from a distance of several paces, can provide information that might otherwise be unobtainable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General appearance</strong> &ndash; Children with radial head subluxation typically appear comfortable as long as the arm is not moved. Significant pain at rest suggests fractures; or less commonly, arthritis, osteomyelitis, or sickle cell disease. Fever or ill appearance are concerning for an infectious cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Examination of the affected arm</strong> &ndash; The following findings help in narrowing the differential diagnosis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Position </strong>&ndash; A child with RHS often holds the arm pronated and slightly flexed with obvious diminished movement although typically without apparent discomfort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82235 \">figure 2</a>). A child with neurologic abnormality may hold the arm limply at the side of the body. A child with a fracture may support the injured arm using the unaffected arm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Inspection</strong> &ndash; Evaluate for deformity, redness, swelling or bruising which may be evidence of localized trauma or inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Palpation</strong> &ndash; The arm should be palpated from the sternoclavicular joint to the fingers to identify areas of warmth, swelling or tenderness (often best accomplished in the younger child while he or she is being distracted). Patients with RHS typically have no reproducible tenderness at rest but often have poorly localized pain with movement. The patient with no tenderness who does not have RHS yet is not moving the limb should be closely evaluated for neurologic impairment. For children in whom the examiner is unable to distinguish whether the reaction to palpation is secondary to pain as opposed to stranger anxiety, it may be helpful to have the parent palpate the arm while the examiner observes from across the room or the doorway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Joint exam </strong>&ndash; Joints should be assessed for focal warmth, redness, tenderness and range of motion; however, if a history of trauma is present manipulation can be deferred until an acute fracture has been excluded by radiograph.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Neurovascular status</strong> &ndash; Careful assessment should be performed.

These images may reveal a fracture or dislocation. Normal plain radiographs often imply soft-tissue injury, but reproducible tenderness or swelling overlying the epiphysis implies a Salter-Harris I fracture. Not infrequently, a child with radial head subluxation may have an atypical clinical picture; if a child younger than four to five years has radiographs that exclude a fracture, but the patient is holding the arm in a characteristic position without focal tenderness, an attempt at reduction should be performed.

Children with neurologic abnormalities should be evaluated urgently to localize the site and cause of the impairment (eg, central versus peripheral process) and to determine if they have an underlying predisposition for stroke (eg, sickle cell disease, hypercoagulable state, or congenital heart disease). Appropriate imaging and subspecialist consultation (eg, neurologist or neurosurgeon with pediatric expertise) should occur. The rare child or adolescent with neurologic findings that are illogical anatomically and physiologically may have a conversion disorder.

Patients with fever or other findings of systemic inflammation warrant measurement of a complete blood count, blood culture, and inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) and plain radiographs (although occasionally some children may have fever from an unrelated source, eg, viral illness). Other laboratory studies may be indicated depending upon the clinical findings (eg, creatine phosphokinase in patients with possible myositis; serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid if concern for oncologic process). Based upon the history, physical examination, imaging and laboratory studies the child may have infection (eg, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis), malignancy, rheumatologic, or noninfectious inflammatory disease, for which the clinician can begin specific management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356005995\"><span class=\"h2\">No trauma or concern for neurologic, infectious, or systemic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients without a history of trauma and with no evidence for neurologic, infectious, or systemic disease should undergo plain radiographs to evaluate for bony abnormalities (eg, fracture, dislocation, tumor) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F88517\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88517 \">algorithm 1A</a>). An attempt at reduction of a radial head subluxation (RHS) is warranted for children with normal radiographs who are younger than five years. If there is no improvement, then the diagnosis is most likely either a soft tissue injury or an unreduced RHS. These patients may be immobilized in a sling or splint and should undergo evaluation in one to two days.</p><p>If radiographs are normal in the older child, he or she may have a soft tissue injury, complex regional pain syndrome, or conversion disorder.</p><p>Regardless of age, an indolent pathologic process or occult fracture may be present in patients without a clear etiology.
