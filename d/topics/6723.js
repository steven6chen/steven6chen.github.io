Osteoporosis is a skeletal condition characterized by low bone mass, whereas osteomalacia is a disorder of decreased bone mineralization of newly formed osteoid at sites of bone turnover. Both disorders increase the risk for fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-osteomalacia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of osteomalacia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation of low bone mass in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis).

In observational studies, age, weight, height, histologic stage, menopausal status, vitamin D deficiency, and severity and duration of liver damage were identified as risk factors for osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/4,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,8,9</a>]. Only 20 percent of patients with advanced stages of PBC have normal bone mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of fractures among patients with PBC is approximately 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. When compared with the general population, the absolute increase in fracture risk is moderately increased. In a population-based study, patients with primary biliary cholangitis had a twofold increased risk of any fracture compared with the general population, with an absolute excess fracture rate of 12.5 per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In one study, fractures were associated with bone density, menopause, age, and height but not with severity of PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Osteomalacia, characterized by decreased bone mineralization, is rarely seen in PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When present, it is typically associated with vitamin D deficiency, with or without concomitant fat malabsorption.

The plasma concentration of calcium is usually normal. Patients with cholestatic liver disease may be at increased risk for malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins due to decreased bile acid secretion, and deficiency of vitamin D is seen in approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>]. However, chronic cholestasis leading to malabsorption of vitamin D does not fully explain bone disease in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) because the plasma concentrations of calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) and calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) are normal in some patients with PBC and osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Oral bisphosphonates should not be used as therapy in patients with esophageal disorders (eg, esophageal varices) or with an inability to follow the dosing requirements (eg, stay upright for at least 30 minutes). These patients can be treated instead with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy.
