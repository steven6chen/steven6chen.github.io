The first step in the management of patients with ACS is prompt recognition, since the beneficial effects of therapy are greatest when performed soon after hospital presentation. For patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain suspicious of an ACS, the diagnosis of MI can be confirmed by the electrocardiogram and serum cardiac biomarker elevation; the history is relied upon heavily to make the diagnosis of unstable angina.

As a consequence, initial management is the same for these two syndromes. For this reason, and because the pathogenetic mechanisms of the two conditions are similar, they are often considered together.
