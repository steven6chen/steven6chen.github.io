In general, patients in developed settings typically present acutely at an early stage of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], while patients in developing settings may have a delayed presentation with manifestations of subacute IE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H557821181\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever is the most common symptom of IE (up to 90 percent of patients); it is often associated with chills, anorexia, and weight loss. Other common symptoms of IE include malaise, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, night sweats, abdominal pain, dyspnea, cough, and pleuritic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with IE associated with dental infection may report tooth pain or related symptoms.</p><p>Cardiac murmurs are observed in approximately 85 percent of patients. Supportive signs include splenomegaly and cutaneous manifestations such as petechiae or splinter hemorrhages. Petechiae are observed in 20 to 40 percent of patients; they may be present on the skin (usually on the extremities) or on mucous membranes such as the palate or conjunctivae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F57118\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57118 \">picture 1</a>). Splinter hemorrhages consist of nonblanching linear reddish-brown lesions under the nail bed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72076\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72076 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical manifestations reflecting complications of IE may be present at the time of initial presentation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may develop subsequently, as discussed below. When present, such findings warrant independent diagnostic evaluation, concurrent with evaluation for IE. (See <a href=\"#H2802726720\" class=\"local\">'Complications as presenting symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Relatively uncommon clinical manifestations that are highly suggestive of IE include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Janeway lesions &ndash; Nontender erythematous macules on the palms and soles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58380\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58380 \">picture 3</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osler nodes &ndash; Tender subcutaneous violaceous nodules mostly on the pads of the fingers and toes, which may also occur on the thenar and hypothenar eminences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68796\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68796 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Roth spots &ndash; Exudative, edematous hemorrhagic lesions of the retina with pale centers</p><p/><p>Janeway lesions are more common in acute than subacute IE; histologically, they reflect microabscesses with neutrophil infiltration of capillaries. Osler nodes and Roth spots occur most frequently in the setting of protracted bacteremia; they probably represent the sequelae of vascular occlusion by microthrombi leading to localized immune-mediated vasculitis. Roth spots (also described as Litten spots) occur in 2 percent of patients with IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Osler nodes were commonly observed among patients with IE in the preantibiotic era though are now uncommon since IE is frequently diagnosed and treated before their development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2802726720\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications as presenting symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IE is associated with a broad array of systemic complications due to septic embolization, which may be associated with localized thrombosis, bleeding, infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> development of immune reactions. Clinical manifestations reflecting these complications may be present at the time of initial presentation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may develop subsequently (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and outcome of infective endocarditis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac complications (up to 50 percent of patients) &ndash; Valvular insufficiency, heart failure, and others</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic complications (up to 40 percent of patients) &ndash; Embolic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, brain abscess, and others</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Septic emboli (up to 25 percent of patients) &ndash; Infarction of kidneys, spleen, and other organs.

As examples, patients with IE may present with clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure due to valvular regurgitation, focal neurologic complaints due to an embolic stroke, or back pain due to vertebral osteomyelitis. A thorough investigation of extracardiac manifestations is particularly important in the setting of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> bacteremia given the virulence of this organism. Issues related to complications of IE are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-staphylococcus-aureus-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Staphylococcus aureus infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and outcome of infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107317790\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory findings in the setting of IE are relatively nonspecific; they may include elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated C-reactive protein), normochromic-normocytic anemia, and positive rheumatoid factor. Hyperglobulinemia, cryoglobulinemia, circulating immune complexes, hypocomplementemia, and false-positive serologic tests for syphilis occur in some patients. Urinalysis may demonstrate microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pyuria. The presence of red blood cell casts on urinalysis is generally indicative of glomerulonephritis, which is a minor diagnostic criterion for IE. (See <a href=\"#H973176202\" class=\"local\">'Modified Duke criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Electrocardiography may demonstrate new or evolving conduction disease (first-degree atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, or complete heart block), reflecting paravalvular or myocardial extension of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4084836\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973173900\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) should be suspected in patients with fever (with or without bacteremia) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relevant cardiac risk factors (prior IE, presence of a prosthetic valve or cardiac device, history of valvular or congenital heart disease) or noncardiac risk factors (intravenous drug use, indwelling intravenous lines, immunosuppression, or a recent dental or surgical procedure).</p><p>The diagnosis is established based on clinical manifestations, blood cultures (or other microbiologic data), and echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The accepted criteria for diagnosis of IE are the modified Duke criteria, which are summarized below and in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73023 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53004 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-clinical-diagnosis-of-endocarditis-not-appropriate-for-neonates-age-28-days\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Additional evaluation for patients with suspected IE includes electrocardiography, chest radiography, other radiographic imaging tailored to clinical manifestations, and dental evaluation.</p><p>At least three sets of blood cultures should be obtained from separate venipuncture sites prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. For patients who are clinically stable, antimicrobial therapy may be deferred while awaiting the results of blood cultures and other diagnostic tests. For patients with signs of clinical instability, initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy (after blood cultures have been obtained) is appropriate. Follow-up blood cultures should be obtained 48 to 72 hours after antimicrobial therapy is begun and repeated every 48 to 72 hours until clearance of bacteremia is documented. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Blood cultures'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood cultures for the detection of bacteremia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial therapy of native valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Empiric therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Echocardiography should be performed in all patients with suspected IE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73023 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53004 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106519\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106519 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-9</a>]. In general, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first diagnostic test for patients with suspected IE. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has higher sensitivity than TTE and is better for detection of cardiac complications such as abscess, leaflet perforation, and pseudoaneurysm. In some circumstances, it is reasonable to forgo TTE and proceed to TEE. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional diagnostic evaluation for patients with suspected or known IE includes electrocardiography, chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) of the torso, and additional radiographic imaging tailored to clinical manifestations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiography (ECG) &ndash; Baseline ECG should be performed as part of the initial evaluation for all patients with suspected IE, with subsequent telemetry monitoring or serial electrocardiograms. The presence of heart block or conduction delay (which may manifest initially as a prolonged PR interval) may provide an important clue to paravalvular extension of infection to the valve annulus and adjacent septum (which should prompt further evaluation with echocardiography as discussed below). In addition, the presence of findings consistent with ischemia or infarction may suggest the presence of emboli to the coronary circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-basic-principles-of-ecg-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Basic principles of ECG analysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiography &ndash; Chest radiography is warranted to evaluate for presence of septic pulmonary emboli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80439\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80439 \">image 1</a>), infiltrate (with or without cavitation), congestive heart failure, and potential alternative causes of fever and systemic symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography &ndash; CT of the torso is useful to evaluate for subclinical sites of metastatic infection (such as splenic infarct, renal infarcts, psoas abscess, or other sites of infection) that may warrant localized drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>]. Routine brain imaging with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not necessary, though further study is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,12</a>]; in one study including 53 patients, early use of cerebral MRI led to upgraded classification of IE to definite or possible in one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional radiographic imaging to evaluate for complications of IE should be tailored to findings on history and physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As examples, patients with back pain should be evaluated for vertebral osteomyelitis with MRI, and patients with headache, neurologic deficits, or meningeal signs should be evaluated with head MRI for neurologic complications (including intracranial mycotic aneurysm or central nervous system bleeding). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infected-mycotic-arterial-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infected (mycotic) arterial aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Lastly, patients with IE should undergo a thorough dental evaluation; the examination should focus on periodontal inflammation, pocketing around teeth, and caries that may result in pulpal infection and subsequent abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Risk factors for IE include cardiac factors (history of prior IE, presence of a prosthetic valve or cardiac device, or history of valvular or congenital heart disease) and noncardiac factors (intravenous drug use, indwelling intravenous catheter, immunosuppression, or a recent dental or surgical procedure). (See <a href=\"#H3210980956\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of IE are highly variable; IE may present as an acute, rapidly progressive infection or as a subacute or chronic disease with low-grade fever and nonspecific symptoms. Fever is the most common symptom of IE (up to 90 percent of cases); it is often associated with chills, anorexia, and weight loss. Other symptoms of IE include malaise, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, night sweats, abdominal pain, dyspnea, cough, and pleuritic pain. Cardiac murmurs are observed in approximately 85 percent of patients. Supportive signs include cutaneous manifestations such as petechiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F57118\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57118 \">picture 1</a>) or splinter hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72076\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72076 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IE is associated with a broad array of systemic complications; these include cardiac and neurologic complications, septic emboli, metastatic infection, and systemic immune reactions. Clinical manifestations reflecting these complications may be present at the time of initial presentation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may develop subsequently. Clinical manifestations of a complication of IE warrant independent diagnostic evaluation, concurrent with evaluation for IE. (See <a href=\"#H2802726720\" class=\"local\">'Complications as presenting symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of IE should be suspected in patients with fever (with or without bacteremia) in the setting of relevant cardiac and noncardiac risk factors. The diagnosis is established based on clinical manifestations, blood cultures (or other microbiologic data), and echocardiography. The accepted criteria for diagnosis of IE are the modified Duke criteria, which are summarized above and in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73023 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53004 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-clinical-diagnosis-of-endocarditis-not-appropriate-for-neonates-age-28-days\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H973173900\" class=\"local\">'Overview of diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H973176202\" class=\"local\">'Modified Duke criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least three sets of blood cultures should be obtained from separate venipuncture sites prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. For patients who are clinically stable, antimicrobial therapy may be deferred while awaiting the results of blood cultures and other diagnostic tests. For patients with signs of clinical instability, initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy (after three blood cultures have been obtained) is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H973173900\" class=\"local\">'Overview of diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical microorganisms consistent with IE include <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, viridans streptococci, <em>Streptococcus gallolyticus </em>(formerly <em>S. bovis</em>), HACEK (<em>Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella</em>) organisms, or community-acquired enterococci. (See <a href=\"#H973176202\" class=\"local\">'Modified Duke criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture-negative IE should be suspected in patients with negative blood cultures and persistent fever with one or more clinical findings consistent with infective endocarditis (eg, stroke or other manifestations of emboli). Culture-negative IE should also be suspected in patients with vegetation on echocardiogram and no clear microbiologic diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2561123772\" class=\"local\">'Culture-negative endocarditis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=culture-negative-endocarditis-epidemiology-microbiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Culture-negative endocarditis: Epidemiology, microbiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography should be performed in patients with suspected IE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73023 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53004 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106519\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106519 \">algorithm 1</a>). In general, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first diagnostic test for patients with suspected IE. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has higher sensitivity than TTE and is better for detection of cardiac complications such as abscess, leaflet perforation, and pseudoaneurysm. In some circumstances, it is reasonable to forgo TTE and proceed to TEE. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional evaluation for patients with suspected IE includes electrocardiography, chest radiography, other radiographic imaging tailored to clinical manifestations, and dental evaluation.
