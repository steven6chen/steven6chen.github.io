Laboratory tests to evaluate fetal health can be performed on amniotic fluid since this fluid is largely composed of fetal substances: urine, secretions, exfoliated cells, and transudate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497450\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common diagnostic indications for obtaining amniotic fluid are prenatal genetic studies and assessment of fetal lung maturity. Other indications include, but are not limited to, evaluation of the fetus for infection, degree of hemolytic anemia, blood or platelet type, hemoglobinopathy, and neural tube defects. </p><p>Amniocentesis is also performed as a therapeutic procedure to remove excess amniotic fluid, such as in symptomatic polyhydramnios or twin-twin transfusion syndrome, or to reduce volume and pressure of amniotic fluid in cases of prolapsed fetal membranes in the second trimester to facilitate placement of an emergency cerclage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This procedure is termed amnioreduction and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin-twin transfusion syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Amnioreduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyhydramnios#H350994269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyhydramnios&quot;, section on 'Amnioreduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transvaginal-cervical-cerclage#H320435712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transvaginal cervical cerclage&quot;, section on 'Replacement of prolapsed membranes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniocentesis, like other potentially morbid procedures, should be preceded by appropriate counseling regarding the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purpose of the procedure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential complications, including technical problems that might necessitate a second procedure </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time required before results will be available</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accuracy and limitations of the diagnostic test(s) planned, including possible inability to make a diagnosis </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatives that may yield the same or similar information</p><p/><p>Depending on the condition under investigation, invasive alternatives to amniocentesis may include chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and fetal blood sampling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-blood-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal blood sampling&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sampling maternal blood for cell-free DNA is a noninvasive method for diagnosing DNA-based conditions (including fetal sex, Rh typing, and single gene disorders), and to screen for the most common aneuploidies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniocentesis for prenatal genetic studies is technically possible at any gestational age after approximately 11 weeks of gestation, but is optimally performed at 15 to 17 weeks of gestation. Procedures performed before 15 weeks (ie, early amniocentesis) are associated with higher fetal loss and complication rates, including culture failure, and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Later procedures can be problematic if termination of pregnancy is planned based upon abnormal results. However, late procedures for genetic studies are performed in some cases, such as when fetal abnormalities are discovered late in gestation, because the information can be useful for counseling and preparing parents, as well as for planning the optimal time, route, and site of delivery. </p><p>Fetal genetic studies (eg, conventional karyotype, microarray) can be determined by studying cells obtained via amniocentesis, CVS, or fetal blood sampling. Test results are available sooner when blood is the source of cellular material: 24 to 48 hours versus 7 to 10 days when amniocytes or chorionic villus cells are cultured. This is because cells from amniotic fluid and chorionic villi need to be stimulated to grow before they can be captured in metaphase for conventional G-banding, whereas cells from a blood sample are rapidly dividing and can be captured in metaphase immediately. Use of chromosomal microarray appears to increase diagnostic yield because it can identify microdeletions and microduplications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics#H1897463\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Clinical indications for CMA in obstetrics'</a>.).</p><p>Most of the cells floating in amniotic fluid are morphologically and biochemically characterized as epithelioid; fibroblastoid and amniotic fluid-specific cells are also present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cells shed from the amnion and the lower fetal urinary tract comprise the largest proportion of proliferating amniotic fluid cells. Although the amniotic fluid contains more than 200,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mL</span> at 16 weeks of gestation, only a small number of the floating cells (average 3.5&plusmn;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mL</span> of fluid) are capable of attaching to a culture substrate and yielding colonies. Cells derived from amniotic fluid before 15 weeks and at 24 to 32 weeks show a significant decline in cloning efficiency (fewer than 1.5 clone forming <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mL</span> fluid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Indeed, laboratory-related failure rates of karyotyping increase significantly with advancing gestation so that, in the third trimester, karyotyping is more likely to fail than microarray [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497062\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluorescence in situ hybridization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) provides a limited karyotype within 24 to 48 hours, but only detects aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y, which are the most common causes of aneuploidy. Irrevocable actions (eg, pregnancy termination) should not be undertaken based on FISH results alone because rare false positives occur. The American College of Medical Genetics monograph Standards and Guidelines for Clinical Genetics Laboratories states that &quot;abnormalities detected by interphase FISH that are also considered reliably detectable by chromosome analysis should be confirmed by conventional cytogenetic analysis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics#H15538631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497125\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation of fetal demise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromosomal abnormalities are more prevalent in stillborn than liveborn infants. Amniocentesis to obtain fetal cells as soon as possible after fetal demise is more likely to yield viable cells for analysis than tissue obtained after delivery. Use of chromosomal microarray appears to increase diagnostic yield because it does not require cell culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal death and stillbirth: Maternal care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics#H12423093\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Fetal demise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal lung maturity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal lung maturity testing is rarely performed in the United States as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) does not recommend amniocentesis for assessment of fetal lung maturity to guide the timing of delivery in well-dated pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If fetal lung maturity is assessed, amniocentesis is usually performed after 32 weeks of gestation since pulmonary maturity is unlikely before this time and the rate of falsely mature results is higher at earlier gestational ages. Fetal lung maturity is not assessed after 39 weeks because the risk of respiratory distress in the neonate is low. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of fetal lung maturity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics for reducing procedure-related pregnancy loss has not been evaluated extensively. One trial randomly assigned 33,748 women to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> 500 mg daily for three days before amniocentesis or no antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. All of the procedures were performed by a single operator. There were significantly fewer fetal losses in the four weeks after the procedure in the prophylaxis group than in the control group (0.03 versus 0.28 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.26). Nearly half of the fetal losses <span class=\"nowrap\">(21/43)</span> occurred in the setting of premature rupture of membranes, which also occurred less often in the prophylaxis group (0.06 versus 1.12 percent; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03-0.10). </p><p>However, there were several limitations to this trial, such as lack of follow-up until delivery, an unusually high rate of membrane rupture within four weeks of the procedure, an unusually high rate of fetal death after membrane rupture (14 percent) in the control group, and the use of a single dedicated operator performing all procedures (raising the issue of reproducibility of the results). Thus, it is unlikely that the conclusions from the trial will change the standard of care, which is <strong>not</strong> to use antibiotic prophylaxis prior to amniocentesis. Results from a case control study support this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Site selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An obstetrical ultrasound examination is initially performed to determine fetal viability, position, biometry, location of the placenta, and anatomic survey. The presence and location of an amniochorionic separation, which may be seen as late as 16 to 17 weeks of gestation, should also be noted if present. If the pregnancy is 15 to 16 weeks of gestation, we delay amniocentesis for a week, if possible, to allow more time for membrane fusion. </p><p>The optimal needle insertion site is then selected, avoiding the placenta if possible. Some studies have suggested a greater risk of fetal complications with transplacental amniocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]; however, this has been challenged by other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. If a transplacental approach is required, options include traversing the placenta or delaying the procedure by one week to allow the greater intrauterine volume with advancing gestation to potentially create a placenta-free window. If the first option is chosen, the needle should be directed through the thinnest portion of the placenta. Color flow mapping may be helpful to identify and avoid the umbilical cord insertion site and large chorionic vessels. If the maternal bladder interferes with the path of the needle, the woman should void prior to needle insertion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497744\"><span class=\"h2\">Site preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maternal abdomen is cleaned with an antiseptic solution and draped. It is prudent to cleanse a larger area of maternal abdomen than the site identified for needle insertion since fetal movements may change the location of the optimal pocket of fluid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497759\"><span class=\"h2\">Local anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local anesthesia is optional but usually unnecessary, as most women have no or mild discomfort, administration of anesthetic is itself somewhat painful, and no intervention has been proven to reduce this discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. Risk factors for pain at amniocentesis include maternal anxiety, history of menstrual cramps, previous amniocentesis, and needle insertion into the lower part of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. When our patients request anesthesia, we tell them that amniocentesis is associated with two moments of discomfort, one at skin insertion and the other when the needle crosses the uterine muscle; local anesthesia may relieve the former sensation, but is ineffective for the latter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 20 or 22 gauge spinal needle is generally used for amniocentesis. Use of the larger bore needle lowers the risk of intrauterine bleeding if the needle is passed through the placenta and allows faster fluid retrieval compared with use of 22 gauge needle, but causes more maternal discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The standard length of a spinal needle is 8.9 cm (excluding the hub), but longer needles are available (15 cm). The length of the needle should take into account the thickness of the maternal panniculus, location of the target pocket of fluid, and the possibility that intervening events, such as uterine contractions, may increase the distance between the skin and target.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle insertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of concurrent ultrasound guidance rather than pre-amniocentesis ultrasound evaluation has not been associated with a reduced rate of fetal losses in controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Nevertheless, ultrasonographic monitoring with continuous visualization of the needle should be performed throughout the procedure to avoid direct fetal injury (see below) and to reduce the number of punctures and the incidence of bloody fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The probe is either held by an assistant in an area of skin away from that cleansed with antiseptic or, more commonly, it is inserted in a sterile pouch (eg, a glove). Nonsterile gel is placed in the pouch in contact with the probe and sterile gel is placed on the outer surface of the pouch in contact with the maternal skin.</p><p>A &quot;free-hand technique&quot; is preferred by most operators because it permits adjustments in the path of needle insertion. However, a needle-guiding device attached to the transducer may facilitate reaching the optimal pocket of fluid, particularly with less experienced operators. Most real-time ultrasound machines are equipped with an on-screen template of the needle tract that is used to target the sampling site.</p><p>The maternal bowel and bladder should be identified and excluded from the path of the needle. Traversing the bowel, which is rare, can introduce bowel flora into the amniotic fluid, leading to infection and pregnancy loss.</p><p>Most operators prefer to insert the needle while holding the transducer themselves; once the needle tip is in place, an assistant holds the transducer and maintains visualization of the needle tip while the operator draws amniotic fluid samples. Other operators prefer to be guided throughout the procedure by an assistant.</p><p>The operator should be familiar with the appearance of the needle on the screen. If a &quot;parallel&quot; approach is taken to needle insertion, the needle enters the skin at the end of a curvilinear or sector probe and can be imaged along its entire extent from skin to target location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67803\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67803 \">image 1</a>). If a &quot;perpendicular&quot; approach is taken, the needle is inserted adjacent to the middle of a linear or curvilinear probe, and only the area of the needle tip is imaged.</p><p>The needle should not be advanced if the position of its tip cannot be identified on the screen. Using the operator's wrist, a sudden thrust of the needle as it passes from the uterine muscle into the amniotic cavity may help to avoid membrane tenting (see below). Entrance into the amniotic cavity is often accompanied by a tactile popping sensation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Dry tap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniotic fluid typically appears at the needle hub when the stylet is removed. If no amniotic fluid is visible at removal of the stylet, fetal membranes may have tented over the needle tip, thus preventing needle penetration into the amniotic cavity (ie, impingement of the membranes without piercing them). This occurs more often with insertions prior to 15 completed weeks of gestation due to incomplete physiological &lsquo;fusion&rsquo; of the amnion, chorion, and decidua parietalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F91180\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91180 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>The needle may be rotated to redirect the bevel and puncture the membranes. However, if this maneuver is unsuccessful and the needle must be repositioned, the stylet should be reinserted before further thrusts are made. These subsequent attempts at redirecting the needle should be guided ultrasonographically.</p><p>Alternatively, the needle may be withdrawn within the maternal abdomen and redirected to an area of the uterus where there is no amniochorionic separation. A second needle insertion may also be attempted. If a dry tap occurs, many clinicians will postpone another attempt until a week has passed, although procedure-related fetal losses are not related to the number of punctures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Failure to obtain amniotic fluid after 15 weeks by experienced operators using ultrasound guidance occurs in less than 1 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/9,14,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,27</a>]. The rate of failure to aspirate fluid was much higher in older studies that did not use ultrasound guidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawing and handling the sample</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial drop of amniotic fluid may contain maternal cells acquired by the needle from passage through the maternal abdominal and uterine walls. Most operators discard this drop because inclusion of this sample may be responsible for low level mosaicism with maternal cells in cytogenetic studies. Others aspirate the initial sample of fluid into a separate syringe for amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein determination.</p><p>Twenty to 30 mL of amniotic fluid are aspirated into sterile syringes by gentle traction on the barrel or by use of vacuum tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The amount of amniotic fluid withdrawn should be based upon gestational age since amniotic fluid volume increases across pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59704 \">figure 1</a>). One rule of thumb for removing an appropriate amount of amniotic fluid is to take a volume in milliliters equivalent to the gestational age in weeks (eg, 15 mL at 15 weeks).</p><p>There have been a few case reports of growth inhibition in amniocentesis cell cultures due to prolonged contact of the fluid with the syringe stopper (the black, rubber-like, grommet on the end of the plunger rod). To minimize this risk, it is recommended that the syringe be kept in a tip down position until the fluid is transferred to the culture tubes, and that the time the amniotic fluid is kept in the syringe be minimized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-procedural care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetal heart rate should be assessed sonographically after the procedure and recorded. Uterine cramping, transient spotting, and vaginal loss of a few drops of amniotic fluid may occur immediately after the procedure. The woman should be instructed to report any persistent loss of vaginal fluid or bleeding, severe uterine cramping lasting for several hours, or fever. Limitation of activity after the procedure is unnecessary.</p><p>Electronic fetal and uterine monitoring following procedures performed after fetal viability are an option to assess for uterine contractions triggered by the procedure and to provide reassurance regarding fetal status. Alternatively, sonographic demonstration of normal fetal heart rate and activity post-procedure is adequate in most cases. </p><p>Nonalloimmunized Rh(D)-negative women should receive Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (eg, RhoGAM) after the procedure to prevent Rh(D) sensitization. ACOG recommends a dose of 300 mcg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Rhesus (D) alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCOLORED SAMPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood-tinged amniotic fluid is aspirated in less than 1 percent of amniocenteses when the procedure is done under ultrasound guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/9,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27</a>]. The blood is almost always of maternal origin and does not adversely affect amniotic cell growth. Two studies have reported an increased risk of fetal loss after bloody taps (odds ratios [OR] of 2.2 and 6.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>]. In contrast, a series of 5948 procedures performed under ultrasound guidance by the same operator reported a 3.7 percent rate of &lsquo;hemorrhagic&rsquo; amniotic fluid, but did not find an association between bloody fluid and fetal loss up to 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The presence of green or brown pigment in second trimester amniotic fluid is more common (approximately 2 percent) than gross blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54992\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54992 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/9,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27</a>]. This type of discoloration indicates intraamniotic hemorrhage antedating amniocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], since the fetus does not pass pigmented meconium in the first half of pregnancy. Green or brown fluid is associated with a higher rate of miscarriage or fetal death than clear fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. As an example, one randomized trial reported the relative risk of miscarriage of a euploid fetus after amniocentesis was increased 10-fold (95% CI 4.3-22.6) if discolored fluid was withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The rate of miscarriage was particularly high (occurring in one-third of pregnancies) if there was both abnormally colored fluid and an unexplained high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein.</p><p>Discolored amniotic fluid is more likely to be associated with chromosomal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], culture failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and microbial contamination of the amniotic fluid (particularly Mycoplasma species) than clear fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Detection of Mycoplasma may indicate chronic endometrial infection, and possibly a higher risk of premature rupture of membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Fluid loss is almost always small and usually spontaneously stops within one week, with reaccumulation of fluid and restoration of normal amniotic fluid volume in an average of three weeks (range one to seven weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Cessation of leakage is probably not due to actual repair and regeneration of the membranes, but rather to changes in the decidua and myometrium that block further leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Temporary loss of fluid is generally associated with a good pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Chronic leakage for the duration of pregnancy, ie, frank membrane rupture, rarely occurs, but can also be associated with a good outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In a study comparing premature rupture of membranes after amniocentesis with premature spontaneous rupture of membranes, women experiencing the former delivered at more advanced gestational ages than those with spontaneous premature rupture of membranes (34.2 versus 21.6 weeks), despite similar gestational ages at membrane rupture; perinatal survival was also higher (91 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Given this potential for a good outcome, conservative management with serial monitoring of amniotic fluid volume, fetal growth, and signs of maternal infection is appropriate as a reasonable option. However, patients with chronic fluid loss should be apprised of the increased risks of preterm delivery, skeletal deformation, and pulmonary hypoplasia, especially if anhydramnios is present.

Randomized trials are ideally positioned to provide the best estimates of the procedure-related risk of miscarriage, fetal death, and preterm delivery after amniocentesis. However, only one such trial has been conducted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this trial, outcome of pregnancy was studied in 4606 women 25 to 34 years of age without known risk of genetic disease randomly assigned to undergo amniocentesis or routine care (ultrasound and determination of MSAFP). In both groups, 99 percent of women followed the examination schedule of the group to which they had been allocated. The total spontaneous abortion rate was 1.7 percent in the study group and 0.7 percent in the control group (RR 2.3, 95% CI <span class=\"nowrap\">1/3-4</span>.0). Eleven of the 15 pregnancies with chromosomal aneuploidies in the study group were terminated, whereas in the control group, only one chromosomally abnormal pregnancy was diagnosed and terminated, suggesting that the 1 percent excess risk of spontaneous fetal loss in the amniocentesis group is underestimated.</p><p>Several large case-control and cohort studies have attempted to fill the gap in information on amniocentesis-related risks and complications. However, biases may occur in such studies both among cases and controls. The following factors are major biases in cases. The indication for amniocentesis may select women at increased risk for adverse outcome. Indeed the rate of miscarriage and other complications is significantly affected by maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>] and, to a lesser extent, by other maternal factors (eg, abnormal serum screening results) which may constitute indications for the procedure. Another bias is that, in some series, outcome information was not available in all cases, the rate of loss to follow-up was significantly different between cases and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], or cases lost to follow-up were excluded from analysis. This introduces a bias since pregnancies that are the most difficult to follow up are often associated with fetal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>The following factors are major biases in controls. In all of the non-randomized studies, fetal losses in controls included both normal and abnormal karyotypes, whereas those after amniocentesis mainly involved euploid fetuses (since aneuploid pregnancies were usually terminated). This bias leads to an underestimation of the post-amniocentesis spontaneous fetal loss rate and it explains the paradoxical finding of the FASTER trial, in which amniocentesis was associated with significantly lower odds of spontaneous fetal loss before 24 weeks than controls who did not undergo amniocentesis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Not surprisingly, the rate of termination of pregnancy was significantly higher among women undergoing amniocentesis than in those who did not (2.9 versus 0.2 percent).</p><p>In the FASTER trial, some patients who were screen negative in both trimesters elected to undergo amniocentesis anyway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. This subpopulation of women with screen negative results represents a group in which underestimation of procedure-related spontaneous losses before 24 weeks is minimized because these women would be expected to have a low risk of fetal aneuploidy and thus a low rate of active pregnancy termination. The excess spontaneous loss rate with amniocentesis in screen negative women was 0.15 percent (95% CI -0.25 to 0.81) or a procedure-related loss rate of <span class=\"nowrap\">1/600</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/700</span> procedures. Of note, certain aneuploidies with increased risk of spontaneous midtrimester loss or active pregnancy termination, such as some cases of trisomy 21, 18 and 13 and Turner syndrome, would be expected to be present among screen negative women.</p><p>The choice of the control population also differs from study to study: In one study, the authors chose to compare the observed rate of fetal losses after amniocentesis in their cohort with the expected rate of spontaneous losses based on published data adjusted for ethnicity and maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

However, misdiagnosis using such a technique has been reported in as many as 3.5 percent of samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>If triplets or higher order gestations are present, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> is commonly injected into the second sac and a third needle is inserted into the third sac (and so forth until each sac has been sampled). Withdrawal of clear fluid confirms that a new sac has been successfully entered, while aspiration of blue-tinged fluid indicates that a previously tapped sac was reentered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Single needle technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspiration of both twin sacs using a single needle insertion into the uterus is an alternative technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/101-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">101-104</a>]. This technique reduces maternal discomfort.</p><p>The needle is inserted into the more anterior sac, choosing a pocket of fluid that is contiguous to the deepest twin's sac. After aspiration of fluid from the first sac, the needle is advanced under ultrasound guidance through the dividing membrane into the second sac. No dye is used for confirmation of the origin of the fluid.</p><p>Theoretic concerns with this procedure include the potential for mixing the two fluids, leading to inaccurate interpretation of genetic tests, and shearing of the dividing membrane, resulting in a functionally monoamniotic pregnancy with its attendant risks. Placental location or fetal position may make this procedure either too difficult or too risky. Data using a single needle insertion are too limited to allow an adequate assessment of the associated risks and safety of this approach.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis of amniocentesis in twin pregnancies using double entry technique and ultrasound guidance, the odds of total pregnancy loss in twin pregnancies undergoing amniocentesis were significantly higher than in those not undergoing amniocentesis (pooled OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7; seven studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. The pooled loss rate for one or both fetuses before 24&thinsp;weeks following amniocentesis was 3.5 percent (95% CI 2.6-4.7; 7 studies). Although this loss rate is similar to the natural loss rate in twin pregnancies, these results are difficult to interpret because of variations in the definition of pregnancy loss (fetal death or <span class=\"nowrap\">miscarriage/delivery),</span> whether one or both fetuses were lost, and the timing of loss after the procedure. In the only study that reported procedure-related loss rates by chorionicity, the risk of loss was significantly higher in monochorionic twins that underwent amniocentesis compared with monochorionic twins that did not undergo the procedure (7.7 versus 1.4 percent). </p><p>There are inadequate data from large, well-controlled studies to conclude whether the risk of early procedure-related fetal loss is higher in twin than singleton pregnancies undergoing amniocentesis. Confounders that need to be addressed include maternal age, chorionicity, ultrasound findings, and maternal analyte screening results. Other important factors include the completeness of ascertainment of pregnancy outcome and how fetal loss is defined (all losses up to term versus losses up to 24 weeks versus losses within 4 weeks of the procedure).</p><p>The only two observational studies that compared amniocentesis to CVS in twin pregnancies did not find a significant difference between techniques in pregnancy loss rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-amniocentesis/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Amniocentesis for lung indices or signs of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniocentesis performed late in pregnancy for lung maturity studies only requires that one sac be sampled; ideally, the sac of the twin less likely to be mature is chosen. As an example, if the twins have discordant sexes, the sac of the male fetus is sampled, whereas if the twins are of the same sex, the sac of the larger twin is chosen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Assessment of pulmonary maturity'</a>.)</p><p>Only the lower-most sac needs to be sampled in procedures done in the late second or early third trimester for evaluation of infection in preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor, since infection generally follows an ascending route from the vagina.

When the procedure is performed under ultrasound guidance, reported rates of fetal loss range from about <span class=\"nowrap\">1/100</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span> procedures. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin cites a procedure-related rate of loss of <span class=\"nowrap\">1/300</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/500</span>. A systematic review calculated <span class=\"nowrap\">1/143</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/200</span> rate of pregnancy loss within 14 days of the procedure, but could not determine how many of these losses were procedure-related. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Fetal loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Green or brown fluid is associated with an increased risk of subsequent spontaneous abortion or fetal death compared with clear fluid. Chromosomal abnormalities, culture failure, and microbial contamination of the amniotic fluid (particularly Mycoplasma species) are also more common when the fluid is discolored. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Discolored samples'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks of direct fetal injury or maternal injury during amniocentesis are minimal. There may be a small risk of indirect fetal injury, such as orthopedic abnormalities and respiratory problems. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Direct fetal injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Indirect fetal injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporary leakage of amniotic fluid occurs more frequently in pregnancies that undergo amniocentesis than among controls (1.7 versus 0.4 percent), but is generally associated with a normal pregnancy outcome. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Leakage of amniotic fluid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal to fetal transmission of infection may occur in women with <span class=\"nowrap\">viremia/bacteremia</span> at the time of the procedure. Although the risk is low, noninvasive methods of prenatal fetal risk assessment are preferable, using tests with high sensitivity and low false-positive rates. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Vertical transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When performing amniocentesis in a multiple gestation, we suggest insertion of a new needle for each amniotic cavity. The risk of amniocentesis-related loss in twin pregnancies is likely increased above the baseline risk of loss among twin gestations, but the exact risk is uncertain.
