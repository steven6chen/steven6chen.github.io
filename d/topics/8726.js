Infection in these patients often results in excessive morbidity and mortality, and antimicrobial therapy is typically less effective than in the immunocompetent host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although immunization appears to be an obvious way to prevent infection, many patients with impaired immunity are unable to mount a protective immune response to active vaccination. Furthermore, immunization with live virus vaccines may result in unchecked proliferation of attenuated strains.</p><p>The rationale for immunizing patients who have undergone HCT will be reviewed here. Issues related to immunizations in patients who have had or are waiting for a solid organ transplant, who have undergone chemotherapy for treatment of hematologic malignancies or solid tumors, or who have other immunocompromising conditions, including HIV infection, and in healthy adults and healthcare workers are discussed separately.

The greater the degree of immunosuppression, the less likely the patient is to respond to immunization. Although certain vaccines provide some benefit to the immunocompromised patient, an adequate response cannot be assumed. Successful protection of the immunocompromised adult may require the use of vaccines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> passive immunization (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>) as well as adjunctive measures, such as antiviral drug prophylaxis during influenza A outbreaks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-seasonal-influenza-with-antiviral-drugs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of seasonal influenza with antiviral drugs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-and-treatment-with-antiviral-drugs#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention and treatment with antiviral drugs&quot;, section on 'Chemoprophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>The degree of immunosuppression after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) varies with the type of transplant.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After allogeneic HCT, the immune system of the recipient is replaced by the immune system of the donor. The factors contributing to the patient's &quot;net state of immunosuppression&quot; are the conditioning regimen for HCT, the presence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and the immunosuppressive agents administered after transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since there is no immunologic disparity between graft and host after autologous HCT, the factors contributing to the &quot;net state of immunosuppression&quot; are the high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy administered before transplantation as well as the underlying disease. The risk of infection for autologous HCT recipients may also relate to the cumulative effects of pretransplant immunosuppression, including such medications as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, administered as therapy for the underlying malignancy before HCT.</p><p/><p>Both autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients are at risk of developing infectious complications during the period of immune reconstitution. Both types of HCT recipients initially have profound humoral and cell-mediated immunodeficiency but gradually recover to the point of being capable of functional B and T cell responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although controversial, CD4 count recovery provides a reasonable guide to immune system recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>The challenge is to maintain protective immunity through this period of profound immunosuppression when the recipient is unable to respond to immunization. Strategies focus on transferring, maintaining, and eventually eliciting protective immunity.</p><p>Surveys performed in Europe and the United States have shown that immunization practices after HCT vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In an attempt to standardize prophylactic strategies in HCT recipients, international guidelines were published in 2009 that include recommendations for immunizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2009, guidelines for preventing infectious complications after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) were published, which represent the collaboration of several organizations from Europe and North America, including the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group, the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant Group, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These guidelines replace the 2000 guidelines from the CDC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The 2009 guidelines recommend earlier vaccination of HCT recipients compared with the 2000 guidelines. </p><p>Although the 2009 guidelines make recommendations regarding the optimal time to initiate each of the vaccine series following HCT, no recommendations were made regarding dosing intervals when more than one dose is required, given the lack of data regarding this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, European guidelines from 2005 made recommendations regarding dosing intervals; we have followed these recommendations where relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In 2013, the IDSA published guidelines for vaccination of immunocompromised hosts, including HCT recipients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91882 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Our recommendations are generally in keeping with these various guidelines.</p><p>These recommendations are based largely upon small studies of transplant recipients or information extrapolated from healthy individuals when no information is available in HCT recipients. It is well recognized that vaccine responses vary by type of HCT (eg, allogeneic, autologous, umbilical cord blood, reduced intensity), but there are insufficient data to make separate recommendations for each type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562649016\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO IMMUNIZATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562649038\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretransplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), HCT candidates who are not already immunocompromised should receive the vaccines that are indicated for immunocompetent individuals based upon age, vaccination history, and exposure history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Live virus vaccines are avoided altogether during the first 24 months following HCT, but certain ones (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) are indicated 24 months following HCT in patients who do <strong>not</strong> have active graft-versus-host disease and who are <strong>not</strong> receiving immunosuppressive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>]. The approach to immunization is summarized in the following Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91882 \">table 1</a>).

Alternatively, a dose of Tdap should be administered, followed by either two doses of DT or two doses of Td. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">DT contains full doses of both diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid, whereas Td contains a full dose of tetanus toxoid and a reduced dose of diphtheria toxoid. In the United States, DT and DTaP are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for individuals &gt;6 years due to adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, a study in adult HCT recipients suggests that such individuals have a lower risk of adverse effects with DT administration compared with immunocompetent adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is not known whether the immune response to Td is equivalent to the response to DT. There are also data suggesting that the response to Tdap is poor in autologous HCT recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], suggesting that it should be used as a booster rather than as part of the primary series. For this reason, the IDSA states that a three-dose series of DTaP should be considered for initial vaccination following HCT regardless of patient age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>The 2005 European recommendations suggest that doses should be spaced one to three months apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. After the posttransplant series, tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccines can be administered according to routine recommendations for adults and children.</p><p>If Td is administered in an individual expected to be at increased risk for diphtheria infection, it is reasonable to check diphtheria titers following vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing'</a> below.) </p><p>Tetanus and diphtheria are rare in the developed world. However, tetanus remains common in the developing world and sporadic cases continue to occur in developed countries. Large epidemics of diphtheria have occurred in states of the former Soviet Union, and the disease remains endemic in parts of the developing world. The incidence of pertussis has been increasing in the United States and worldwide due largely to waning immunity among adolescents and adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73317\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73317 \">figure 1</a>). HCT recipients are particularly vulnerable to pertussis infection because of pulmonary damage due to chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total body irradiation. In one study, only 13.5 percent of HCT recipients had protective titers against pertussis after transplantation and only 2 of the 28 patients developed a twofold or greater response to vaccination with Tdap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Titers of both tetanus and diphtheria antibodies vary by age at transplantation, underlying diagnosis, dose intensity, duration of treatment before transplantation, and the transplantation conditioning regimen. Approximately 50 percent of allogeneic HCT recipients and 19 percent of autologous HCT recipients who had protective levels of tetanus antibody before transplantation become seronegative within one year of transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Although donor immunization can be done prior to stem cell harvesting when the donor is related to the recipient and agrees to being vaccinated in order to enhance the immune responses of the recipient, the 2009 international guidelines regarding immunization of HCT recipients do not make a recommendation regarding donor vaccination due to practical and ethical challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The 2013 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend against vaccinating the donor solely for the benefit of the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. We agree with these recommendations.</p><p>The possible benefit to HCT recipients of vaccinating donors has been shown in studies with <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccines, and hepatitis B vaccine: adoptive transfer of specific antibodies was achieved from immunized HCT donors to both non&ndash;T cell&ndash; and T cell&ndash;depleted allogeneic HCT recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/73-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-77</a>].

However, although this strategy may be effective, it is unlikely to be cost effective for the prevention of invasive Hib disease in HCT recipients.</p><p>The ability of donor immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to enhance early protective antibody response was observed in HCT recipients whose donors were randomly assigned to receive either a dose of PCV7 vaccine or no vaccine before transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

After the first dose of vaccine, 76 percent of HCT recipients in the immunized donor group had protective antibody concentrations to all seven serotypes compared with 36 percent in the unimmunized donor group. This strategy may prove to be cost effective since pneumococcal infections are more common than Hib infections during the first transplant year.</p><p>There are case reports of attempts to clear chronically infected HCT recipients by immunizing the donor with hepatitis B vaccine and immunizing the recipient with hepatitis B vaccine in the early posttransplant period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/49,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">HOUSEHOLD CONTACTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Household contacts should receive recommended routine vaccinations.

Although immunization appears to be an obvious way to prevent infection, many patients with impaired immunity are unable to mount a protective immune response to active vaccination. Furthermore, immunization with live virus vaccines may result in unchecked proliferation of attenuated strains.

Following transplantation, HCT recipients typically lose immunity to pathogens against which they were previously immunized. Thus, HCT recipients should be immunized against a number of pathogens such as pneumococcus, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, tetanus, and others once they are likely to mount an immune response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91882 \">table 1</a>).
