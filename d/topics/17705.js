Candidemia is the most common manifestations of invasive candidiasis. <em>Candida</em> in a blood culture should never be viewed as a contaminant and should always prompt a search for the source of the bloodstream infection. For many patients, candidemia is a manifestation of invasive candidiasis that could have originated in a variety of organs, whereas, for others, candidemia originated from an infected indwelling intravenous catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment of candidemia in adults will be reviewed here.

Most prominent have been <em>C. glabrata</em> and <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, followed by <em>C. tropicalis</em> and <em>C. krusei</em>. This is important because some <em>C. glabrata</em> isolates are resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, and all <em>C. krusei</em> isolates are resistant to fluconazole. In addition, the minimal inhibitory concentrations for <em>C. parapsilosis</em> with the echinocandins are higher than for other <em>Candida</em> species. Risk factors for infection with fluconazole-resistant <em>Candida </em>species include neutropenia, recent azole use, and others. The risk factors for and epidemiology of candidemia are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of candidemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevalence of Candida species'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2629268750\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common antifungal agents used for the treatment of candidemia are the echinocandins (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=caspofungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caspofungin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anidulafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anidulafungin</a>) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>. Formulations of amphotericin B are given less often due to the risk of toxicity.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of candidemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend that empiric antifungal therapy be considered in critically ill patients who are at risk for invasive candidiasis and who have persistent fevers and no other known cause of fever; the decision regarding empiric therapy should be based upon clinical assessment of risk factors, surrogate markers for invasive candidiasis (eg, beta-D-glucan) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> culture data from nonsterile sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Empiric therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients with risk factors for invasive candidiasis and signs of septic shock because of the high mortality in this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. We agree with this approach.</p><p>It is not clear whether the empiric use of antifungal agents is beneficial in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. One multicenter randomized trial in the ICU setting found no difference in rate of invasive candidiasis or outcomes between patients given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> empirically and those given placebo; invasive candidiasis occurred in only 9 patients in the fluconazole group and in 11 patients in the placebo group (5 versus 9 percent), a nonsignificant difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. However, this trial was underpowered, with so few patients developing invasive candidiasis that a significant treatment benefit could not be shown. </p><p>In a multicenter randomized trial (EMPIRICUS) of 260 non-neutropenic critically ill patients with <em>Candida</em> colonization at multiple sites, multiorgan failure, and ICU-acquired sepsis, empiric treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a> for 14 days did not result in improved infection-free survival at 28 days but did decrease the rate of new fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Several other studies in patients who had undergone bowel surgery or had bowel perforation showed some benefit of empiric use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>].</p><p>For empiric therapy in ICU patients, we recommend an echinocandin. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> can be used as an alternative in patients who have not received prior fluconazole and who are colonized with fluconazole-susceptible species.

However, the optimal approach remains unclear. We suggest <strong>not</strong> routinely using prophylactic antifungal agents in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. However, consideration can be given to the use of prophylaxis in selected patients in ICUs that have high rates (&gt;5 percent) of invasive candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Only patients at the highest risk for invasive disease should be targeted for prophylaxis; risk factors include central venous catheters, parenteral nutrition, hemodialysis, trauma, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and recent surgery (particularly abdominal surgery) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of candidemia in adults&quot;</a>). In such patients, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> or an echinocandin can be used, depending upon the risk of resistant <em>Candida</em> species.

However, most ICUs have not adopted routine fluconazole prophylaxis because widespread use would likely contribute to increasing fluconazole resistance. In a small study, more selective fluconazole prophylaxis for patients at high risk for intraabdominal candidiasis was beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

There were 10 <em>Candida</em> infections in 102 patients in the caspofungin arm and 14 in the 84 patients who received placebo, a nonsignificant difference.

The in-hospital mortality rate among the 142 patients who had adequate source control within 24 hours of the onset of septic shock and antifungal therapy administered within 24 hours of the onset of septic shock was 53 percent, compared with 98 percent among the 82 patients for whom these goals were not attained. On multivariate analysis, both failure to achieve timely source control (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 77.4, 95% CI 21.5-278.4) and delayed antifungal therapy (aOR 33.8, 95% CI 9.7-118.0) were highly associated with in-hospital mortality.
