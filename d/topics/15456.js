While there is general agreement that first-degree relatives of patients with HH should be screened for the disease, population screening for HH remains a topic of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

It consists of the identification of an asymptomatic disease, harmful condition, or risk factor, with the overall aim that the condition be caught early before it causes harm to the affected individual. Since hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is present at birth, its cause cannot be removed, and primary prevention is not practical. However, secondary prevention, which aims to detect early disease when it is asymptomatic and when treatment might stop it from progressing, is a viable option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evidence-based-approach-to-prevention#H20177847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evidence-based approach to prevention&quot;, section on 'Preventive activities in clinical settings'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2809636\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease penetrance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease penetrance is an important issue when family and population screening for HH are performed, as a significant percent of individuals found to have homozygous HH at the time of screening have no evidence for iron overload either at the time of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>] or after 12 or more years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p>The latter point was shown in a prospective cohort study of Australians of northern European ancestry in whom the overall incidence of <em>HFE</em> C282Y homozygosity was 0.68 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. During 12 years of follow-up, 28 percent of male homozygotes (95% CI 19-40 percent) and only 1.2 percent of female homozygotes (95% CI 0-6 percent) developed criteria for the development of iron-overload-related disease (ie, one or more of the following: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, clinician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6754359\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutoff levels for screening purposes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We and others, including the AASLD screening guidelines outlined below, advocate using a screening &quot;cutoff&quot; value of 45 percent transferrin saturation for both men and women, which will lead to fewer patients being missed (ie, those with the disease but without symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> iron overload) at the expense of an increased false positive rate. It remains to be demonstrated that symptomatic disease can develop in those diagnosed using these lower &quot;cutoff&quot; values.</p><p>A transferrin saturation &ge;60 percent in men or &ge;50 percent in women has been accurate in detecting over 90 percent of patients with homozygous HH who have clinical symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> documented iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Although a study has shown no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes when fasting samples are obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], the 2011 AASLD guidelines (see below) state that it is advisable to confirm an elevated transferrin saturation with a second determination, and it is not unreasonable to do this on a fasting specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>An elevated transferrin saturation is generally more sensitive than the plasma ferritin in screening for HH because a lesser degree of iron overload is required to raise the transferrin saturation than to increase serum ferritin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The accuracy of the above measures of iron status was evaluated in a study involving more than 30,000 adults attending a health clinic who agreed to undergo blood testing and DNA analysis for <em>HFE</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. A transferrin saturation &ge;50 percent had a sensitivity of only 0.57 and a specificity of 0.98 for the detection of C282Y homozygosity. A ferritin level &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> had a sensitivity of 0.66 and specificity of 0.85 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52869 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>As an example, the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study recruited 99,711 participants from primary care practices and blood drawing laboratories; all had blood samples tested for iron studies as well as for the C282Y and H63D mutations of the <em>HFE</em> gene.

Given these estimates, the possibilities for family members are as follows: (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'The HFE gene'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Siblings</strong> &ndash; If the proband is homozygous for the C282Y <em>HFE</em> mutation, both parents must be heterozygotes for this mutation.

The possibility exists that early detection and treatment would have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality if subjects can be identified before cirrhosis has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, counter arguments have been raised based on the low penetrance of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/1,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36,37</a>].

This cost is substantially higher than other screening modalities (such as mammography) that have been considered to be cost-effective.

All participants answered a health questionnaire concerning symptoms potentially related to HH and received comprehensive laboratory screening as well as mutation analysis of the HFE gene. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening identified 152 individuals with the <em>HFE</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/C282Y</span> genotype, 45 of whom had been previously diagnosed with HH.

Of the 333 C282Y homozygotes detected, 75 had been previously diagnosed. Of the 302 C282Y homozygotes who underwent additional testing, 16 and 12 percent had increased levels of ALT and AST, respectively, compared with 11 and 8 percent, respectively, in controls. Of the 11 centrally reviewed liver biopsies, all showed increased liver iron concentrations, but only two had stage 3 or 4 fibrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4965174\"><span class=\"h2\">Studies favoring population screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A favorable conclusion concerning population screening for HH was reached in an Australian study that compared symptoms, laboratory findings, and the results of liver biopsy in two groups of patients found to be homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 1: 401 subjects detected via screening of relatives with proven C282Y-associated HH</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group 2: 271 subjects detected by primary care physicians primarily on routine health checks</p><p/><p>Results for the two groups of subjects were quite similar, as follows (all comparisons are group 1 versus group 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum ALT levels &ndash; 15 versus 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least one disease-related condition present (ie, arthropathy, diabetes, hepatomegaly, hypogonadism, arrhythmia) &ndash; 17 versus 27 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 to 4 iron present on liver biopsy &ndash; 69 versus 82 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 or 3 fibrosis on liver biopsy &ndash; 15 versus 18 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cirrhosis on liver biopsy &ndash; 5 versus 10 percent</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that screening for HH in the primary care setting and family screening revealed comparable levels of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in C282Y homozygotes. Of importance, all those undergoing periodic phlebotomy had a reduction in the degree of hepatic fibrosis and all subjects with cirrhosis were asymptomatic, suggesting that screening for HH is effective in detecting patients with significant but reversible disease and should not be confined to patients with symptomatic liver disease or relatives of probands with HH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2810273\"><span class=\"h2\">Consensus guidelines for population screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 1998 consensus statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Human Genome Research Unit did not recommend population-based genetic screening for HH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This recommendation was based upon uncertainty regarding the prevalence and penetrance of HFE mutations and the optimal care of asymptomatic individuals who have this mutation. The panel also cited possible stigmatization and discrimination among those with a positive screening test as a factor in their decision.</p><p>Two systematic reviews of the available literature from 1966 through 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] or 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] concerning all of the above-noted issues concluded that the available evidence does not demonstrate that benefits outweigh risks and costs of screening for hemochromatosis in the primary care setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based in part on the first of these reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], an American College of Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against such screening in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based in part on the second of these reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against the use of routine genetic screening for HH in the asymptomatic general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>Results from the Australian study cited above, if confirmed by others, may cause us to reevaluate these recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2809563\" class=\"local\">'Overview of disease prevention and screening for HH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rationale against screening</strong> is based upon the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals identified as having HH may never demonstrate clinically significant iron overload (ie, the condition has low penetrance).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is the potential of discrimination by employers and life insurance companies against those detected by such screening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There may be a reluctance of healthcare carriers to pay for treatment (ie, phlebotomy) of asymptomatic individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is a lack of proof that earlier phlebotomy in the population identified via screening reduces morbidity and mortality compared with treatment after a diagnosis has been made during routine clinical care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Detection in family members</strong> &ndash; In a family containing at least one member with symptomatic HH, a fasting transferrin saturation and ferritin concentration, along with testing for mutations in the <em>HFE</em> gene, should be obtained in all first-degree relatives. The optimal time for such testing is likely to be between the ages of 18 and 30, before significant iron overload has had time to occur. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Detection in family members'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Population screening</strong> &ndash; For individuals in the general population without a family history of HH, we suggest not screening for this disorder (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Population screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Screening tests</strong> &ndash; For initial screening purposes we use the following tests: serum (or plasma) ferritin, transferrin saturation, and genetic testing for <em>HFE</em> mutations. (See <a href=\"#H6754697\" class=\"local\">'AASLD screening guidelines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Screening strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Making the diagnosis of HH</strong> &ndash; The diagnosis of HH is made in the vast majority of affected individuals by demonstrating homozygosity for the <em>HFE</em> C282Y mutation. A variable percent of individuals with compound heterozygosity (eg, the <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/H63D</span> genotype) may also develop iron overload. This subject is discussed in depth separately.
