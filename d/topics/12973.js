It involves the knee cap, which doctors call the &quot;patella&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57878\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57878 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Many times, patellofemoral pain happens in runners or other people who put a lot of pressure on their knees. But the condition can also happen when a person's knee cap gets out of line with the knee joint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278125883\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of patellofemoral pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patellofemoral pain causes pain in the front of the knee, or around or behind the knee cap. The pain can come on slowly or quickly. The pain is usually worse when people squat, run, or sit for a long time. Some people might also feel as if their knee is giving out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278125898\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for patellofemoral pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No test can tell for sure if you have patellofemoral pain. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have the condition by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>To make sure your symptoms aren't caused by another condition, your doctor might order an X-ray or imaging test of your knee. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278125913\"><span class=\"h1\">How is patellofemoral pain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment usually involves a few parts.</p><p>The first part of treatment helps to reduce your pain. It can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting your knee and avoiding activities or movements that make the pain worse</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, also called &quot;NSAIDs&quot; &ndash; NSAIDs are a large group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting ice on your knee when it hurts or after activities that cause pain &ndash; You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the painful area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p>Another part of treatment involves doing exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knee. Your doctor or nurse will show you which exercises to do, or he or she will have you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert).</p><p>Your doctor might also recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a knee brace to support your knee.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tape up your knee in a certain way to support your knee.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear special shoe inserts made to fit your foot (to keep your foot from turning in or out too much).</p><p/><p>Your symptoms will most likely improve with treatment. But if they don't, your doctor might have you see a knee specialist to discuss treating your condition with surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278125928\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent getting patellofemoral pain again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting this condition again by doing the exercises and stretches that your doctor or physical therapist shows you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278125943\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Knee pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chondromalacia-patella-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chondromalacia patella (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Knee pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
