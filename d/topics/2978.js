Progression of atheromatous plaque at the carotid bifurcation results in luminal narrowing, often accompanied by ulceration. This process can lead to transient ischemic attack or stroke from arterial embolization, or thrombosis, or less commonly from hemodynamic compromise. Treatment options for carotid occlusive disease include medical management, carotid endarterectomy, and carotid angioplasty and stenting.</p><p>This topic will review procedural aspects of carotid artery stenting (CAS), including early and late complications. Other treatment options are reviewed elsewhere.

The CCA divides into the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) at the level of the superior border of the thyroid cartilage corresponding to the <span class=\"nowrap\">C3/C4</span> disc space. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External carotid artery &ndash; The ECA has multiple branches that supply the face and scalp and provide collateral circulation to the brain.

The cervical segment of the internal carotid extends from the carotid bifurcation until it enters the carotid canal anterior to the jugular foramen.

The carotid sinus baroreceptors are located within the adventitia of the origin of the internal carotid artery and are innervated by the sinus nerve of Hering, which is a branch of glossopharyngeal nerve. In response to low blood pressure, the nerve fibers decrease their firing rates, stimulating the sympathetic nervous system and inhibiting the parasympathetic nervous system via a centrally acting mechanism. </p><p>Carotid sinus reactivity may be impaired in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.

In a Canadian study, while the overall rate of carotid revascularization decreased by 29 percent from 2002 to 2014 (from 6.0 to 4.3 procedures per 100,000 individuals &ge;40 years old) during this period of time, the rate of carotid artery stenting increased by 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106667205\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of the procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of intervention in patients with symptomatic carotid disease depends on the nature and severity of symptoms and is discussed separately.

A staged approach limits the length of the procedure and intravenous contrast load, whereas simultaneous CAS theoretically increases the risk for cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome and the risk of severe bradycardia or hypotension related to bilateral baroreceptor irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In general, older patients and those with complex calcified aortic arches or complex carotid index lesions are considered to be at an increased risk of thromboembolic complications and poor outcomes following CAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some have suggested the development of validated risk scores as a means to predict those patients at risk for in-hospital stroke or death following CAS, primarily to aid with patient selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Several studies have evaluated factors related to cerebral embolization during carotid artery stenting using transcranial Doppler, or have compared cerebral imaging studies before and after CAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/14-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-23</a>]. In one of these studies, pre- and postprocedure diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) was performed on 728 of 837 consecutive patients undergoing CAS with embolic protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. New ipsilateral ischemic brain lesions were found in 32.8 percent of the patients and were associated with increased age, hypertension, increased lesion length, lesion eccentricity, and type III aortic arch. Contralateral ischemic brain lesions were found in 25 percent and were associated with age, greater than 50 percent stenosis of the contralateral carotid artery, type II aortic arch, and a trend for type III aortic arch. The overall stroke rate among all the patients was 1.9 percent; however, only 5 percent of patients with a positive DWMRI developed a clinical deficit. These risk factors for cerebral embolization are similar to those identified in various trials and observational studies as increasing the risk for periprocedural stroke. However, whether or how these embolic events impact clinical outcomes remains debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In addition, a retrospective study suggests that patients older than 80 have a higher incidence of unfavorable arterial factors that increase the technical difficulty of CAS, such as aortic arch elongation, arch calcification, common carotid and innominate artery origin stenosis, common and internal carotid artery tortuosity, and a higher risk of residual stenosis post-stenting due to underlying vessel calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H855944959\"><span class=\"h3\">Gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical studies indicate that the perioperative risk of CAS compared with CEA may be higher in women compared with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-40</a>].

An analysis of plaque characteristics derived from the CREST trial found that only plaque length was associated with age with respect to stroke risk; however, it was responsible for only 8 percent of the excess stroke risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99771484\"><span class=\"h3\">Contralateral disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prospective data suggest that the presence of contralateral carotid stenosis &ge;50 percent is associated with a higher risk for stroke after CAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In support of this hypothesis, a single-center case series of 528 patients who had CAS without protection over a five-year study period noted a significant reduction in the 30-day minor stroke rate in the fifth year compared with the first year (3.1 versus 7.1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The most likely explanation for the inability of EPDs to prevent all perioperative strokes is that they do not prevent all emboli from reaching the distal cerebral vessels.

Another difficulty that may be encountered is passing a filter-type EPD through a severely stenotic internal carotid artery.

However, in one retrospective review of 51 patients, hypotension occurred in 22 percent of the patients and lasted up to 27 hours postoperatively (none less than four hours). Hypotension was associated with older age and history of myocardial infarction but not necessarily with bradycardia (although, on average, the hypotensive group had more episodes of bradycardia).

In the meta-analysis, hemodynamic instability following CAS was significantly associated with age, &gt;10 mm distance between the carotid bifurcation and the site of minimum lumen diameter, and with prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy.
