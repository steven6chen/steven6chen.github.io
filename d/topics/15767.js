However, it is not particularly helpful in distinguishing between different types of peripheral nerve disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Historically, biopsy of a sensory nerve with a specific cutaneous field was necessary to establish an anatomic diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. Cutaneous sensory nerve biopsy remains a standard diagnostic tool in the evaluation of peripheral neuropathies. The most common nerve biopsied is the sural sensory nerve in the calf. While the surgical procedure is generally well tolerated, risks include infection, other surgical morbidity, numbness along the lateral foot, and neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cutaneous nerve biopsy is potentially useful for a limited number of conditions, including peripheral nerve vasculitis, amyloid neuropathy, atypical forms of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, and certain forms of toxic (eg, n-hexane) and hereditary neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For most other causes of peripheral neuropathy, nerve biopsy reveals evidence of axonal loss but is not particularly helpful for determining etiology. Nerve biopsy as a research tool is limited by the potential risks and by the fact that it can only be performed twice (once on each side).The evaluation of small unmyelinated axons by nerve biopsy is challenging, even with electron microscopy. Other pathologic techniques must be used to evaluate small fiber neuropathies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin biopsy with assessment of dermal and epidermal innervation is a standard diagnostic test at many facilities and a powerful research tool. &#160;</p><p/><p>This chapter will review the technique of skin biopsy in the evaluation and study of peripheral nerve disease. Other diagnostic methods for the evaluation of neuropathy and neuromuscular disease are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3851098\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The existence of epidermal innervation was controversial for much of the 20th century, despite the fact that Langerhans first recognized epidermal nerve fibers in the 1860s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. His drawings provide an accurate representation of these epidermal fibers, as confirmed by modern immunohistochemical techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Despite their early recognition, epidermal nerves were difficult to visualize using standardized histochemical techniques, so little effort was made to study them for most of the 20th century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Elegant studies by Winkelman and Dyck demonstrated abnormalities of cutaneous receptors, such as Meissner corpuscles, in subjects with inherited neuropathies, but this technique was of little diagnostic utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In 1989, an immunohistochemical technique was developed that permitted relatively easy visualization of cutaneous nerves and sensory organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. This technique has facilitated widespread study of cutaneous innervation for both clinical and research applications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3851105\"><span class=\"h2\">Methodology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin biopsy is a benign procedure. Most laboratories use a 3 mm punch to obtain skin tissue. This does not require a suture, and the biopsy site heals on its own over several weeks. The only risks are local bleeding and infection. Both are uncommon. The procedure is very well tolerated and may be repeated multiple times in order to follow neuropathy progression.</p><p>The biopsy site depends on the specific indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For length dependent peripheral neuropathies, most laboratories recommend biopsy at the distal leg (8 cm proximal to the lateral malleolus) and at a more proximal site such as the lateral thigh (10 cm distal to the iliac crest). The tissue is immediately placed in either 2 percent periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) or Zamboni solution (2 percent paraformaldehyde, picric acid) for 12 to 24 hours at 4&deg;C, and is then placed in a cryoprotectant solution. The biopsies can then be stored in a freezer or shipped to a central laboratory for processing. The punch biopsy is cut into thick (eg, 50 micron) sections and stained with antiprotein gene product 9.5 antibody (PGP 9.5), which binds to ubiquitin hydrolase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. PGP 9.5 avidly stains all axons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In normal subjects, both epidermal and dermal structures are readily observed and evaluated. The number and morphology of axons within the epidermis are evaluated, by either qualitative or quantitative assessment, to determine epidermal nerve fiber density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These values are compared with age-dependent normal values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>There are two different methods of microscopic analysis. Many groups use standard bright field light microscopy. Its primary advantages are convenience, cost, and ease of use. Other centers use confocal microscopy. Confocal imaging is more labor intensive and expensive, but it allows for multiple antibodies to be more readily used. For example, an antibody to collagen IV may be used to stain the basement membrane with a different fluorescent color, so points where the nerves cross are more easily appreciated.</p><p>For clinical interpretation, both microscopic techniques are adequate. For some research applications, confocal imaging is advantageous. It is important that the ordering physician know which technique is being used, particularly if formal quantification of epidermal nerve fiber density is being performed, because densities are somewhat higher using confocal imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3851112\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A basic appreciation of normal dermal anatomy is essential for understanding pathologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Skin areas are classified as being glabrous (hairless) or nonglabrous:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glabrous skin is located on the palms, soles, and fingertips and contains more sweat glands and cutaneous sensory organs dedicated to touch, position, and vibration sensation. Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles, Merkel cells, and abundant sweat glands are easily observed. Small myelinated fibers that supply these structures are also seen within the dermis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonglabrous skin has fewer sensory organs and myelinated dermal fibers than glabrous skin and a greater number of hair follicles and piloerector muscles, which are supplied by small autonomic nerves.</p><p/><p>Skin in both areas has abundant epidermal nerves in normal subjects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57782 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The dermis extends into the epidermis in undulations called papillae. Normally, there is a network of bundled dermal nerve fibers beneath the dermal-epidermal junction. Some sensory organs such as Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles are located at the apex of dermal papillae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69523\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69523 \">picture 2</a>). Nerve fibers supplying the epidermis also enter in this region, where they lose their myelin sheath.</p><p>Small thinly myelinated (A-delta) and unmyelinated (C) fibers are responsible for pain and temperature sensation. A single fiber typically divides into several branches immediately after crossing into the epidermis. These branches extend in parallel fashion to near the surface of the skin. Independent of age, the density of epidermal innervation is greater at more proximal sites on the body (eg, the back and thigh) than it is at distal locations (eg, the ankle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3851119\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical utility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin biopsy can be used for the diagnosis of any distal symmetric polyneuropathy, including those due to the involvement of small unmyelinated or large myelinated fibers. However, skin biopsy is seldom needed for the diagnosis of large myelinated fiber neuropathy because less invasive electrodiagnostic studies (ie, nerve conduction studies and electromyography) are generally obtained first and are sensitive for the detection of large fiber neuropathy. In contrast, electrodiagnostic studies are insensitive to small and unmyelinated fiber injury. Skin biopsy provides a unique and powerful tool to visualize and assess small nociceptive fibers in a reproducible and validated manner. Thus, the most frequent clinical indication for skin biopsy in the evaluation of peripheral nerve disease is for the diagnosis of patients with suspected small fiber sensory neuropathy. Additionally, because idiopathic and diabetic neuropathies often cause small fiber injury prior to the onset of large fiber injury, skin biopsy may aid in early diagnosis in mixed fiber neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Evaluation of epidermal nerve fibers may also be useful in the diagnosis of patients with truncal pain, in whom postherpetic neuralgia is suspected. Reduced fiber density is observed in the symptomatic region, and on the opposite side to a lesser degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Skin biopsy is also valuable in patients with anhidrosis to document the status of sweat gland innervation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67923\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67923 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Early studies paid little attention to myelinated dermal fibers. However, later studies found that skin biopsy is likely to be sensitive for mixed neuropathies as well as large (myelinated) fiber neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], although these are typically diagnosed by electrodiagnostic studies alone. The binding of IgM to dermal fibers has been documented in patients with anti-MAG neuropathy, but not in normal subjects or those with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Additionally, a longitudinal study demonstrated that skin biopsy is a valuable research tool for monitoring progression in patients with all fiber types of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and potentially for detecting nerve regeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374691\"><span class=\"h3\">Small fiber neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small fiber neuropathy is often a challenging clinical problem. Patients with small fiber sensory neuropathy commonly have severe complaints but only minimal objective abnormalities on examination. Typical symptoms of small fiber neuropathy are distal burning, pain, numbness, and paresthesia, and, frequently, autonomic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Autonomic symptoms may include alterations in sweating, temperature dysregulation, dry eyes and mouth, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erectile dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one study of 67 patients with a pure small fiber neuropathy, skin biopsy was diagnostic in 88 percent of cases, compared with a diagnostic rate by clinical examination of 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In another study of 69 patients with suspected small fiber neuropathy, skin biopsy changed management or diagnosis in 52 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In disorders affecting mainly small, unmyelinated nerve fibers, standard electrophysiologic testing is often normal, and sural nerve biopsy may be normal or only minimally abnormal.</p><p>American guidelines regarding the evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy published in 2009 concluded that epidermal nerve fiber density determination, using antiprotein gene product 9.5 immunohistochemistry, is a validated and reproducible marker of small fiber sensory neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similarly, 2010 European guidelines concluded that distal leg skin biopsy with quantification of the linear density of epidermal nerve fibers is a reliable and efficient technique to assess the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Given the relative simplicity of the technique and its ability to provide quantitative data, the test is also likely to be useful for following disease progression and response to treatment.</p><p>Patients with symptoms isolated to the feet or toes typically have severe depletion or absence of epidermal nerve fibers at the level of the ankle or distal leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81127\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81127 \">picture 4</a>). Reduced fiber density is often appreciated at the level of the proximal thigh. In addition to reduced fiber density, morphologic abnormalities are often observed. Axonal swellings, defined as focal enlargements greater than two times the width of the axon, and complex branching patterns with fibers traversing parallel to the skin surface may be a predegenerative finding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54218\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54218 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Care must be taken in interpreting isolated morphological abnormalities, as small axonal swellings and beading are often observed in normal subjects and may be influenced by technical factors. However, the presence of large axonal swellings has been associated with progressive decline in fiber density among subjects with suspected small fiber neuropathy, and their presence in the proper clinical setting is supportive of that diagnosis.</p><p>Skin biopsy may be particularly useful in subjects who have pain and numbness with diffuse symptoms that do not conform to a length-dependent pattern. While this situation most often suggests non-neuropathic disease or a psychogenic disorder, rare patients can have a non-length dependent small fiber ganglionopathy rather than the classic distal <span class=\"nowrap\">symmetric/length-dependent</span> form of small fiber neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Such patients can present with diffuse, often acute, burning pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Multiple conditions have been associated with non-length dependent painful sensory neuropathies, including but not limited to diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, hepatitis C, and celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a study of patients with small fiber ganglionopathy of various etiologies who had painful non-length dependent sensory symptoms, skin biopsy was abnormal in 14 of 17 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Alternative tests for small fiber function are limited in various ways. Corneal confocal microscopy is a promising noninvasive method for directly measuring nerve fiber density in the cornea but it is not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Sympathetic skin response is very insensitive for the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Quantitative sensory testing for heat, pain, or cold detection thresholds is sensitive, but subjects with psychogenic sensory complaints may have convincing abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Tests of sudomotor function, particularly the quantitative sudomotor axonal reflex test, are sensitive and specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but have lower reproducibility compared with quantitative sensory testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and require special equipment and expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In contrast, skin biopsy has a very high diagnostic accuracy, with positive and negative predictive values of greater than 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Skin biopsy typically does <strong>not</strong> allow for differentiation of different causes of small fiber neuropathy. Reduced fiber density has been documented in a variety of neuropathies, including prediabetic, diabetic, HIV, inflammatory, and idiopathic neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/10,41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,41-45</a>]. If amyloidosis is suspected, biopsy sections may be stained with Congo red to detect amyloid deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>In patients with foot pain and possible neuropathy, a skin biopsy with normal fiber density and morphology should prompt a careful search for a central nervous system or orthopedic problem. In a prospective series of 117 subjects with foot pain and suspected neuropathy, normal nerve conduction studies and skin biopsy results were noted in 13 patients (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In this group, two were ultimately diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3851126\"><span class=\"h2\">Research applications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because skin biopsy is well tolerated and may be repeated multiple times, it is a powerful research tool. Epidermal nerve fiber density measurement provides a unique quantitative measure of small unmyelinated sensory fiber function that is reproducible. It has been used as an endpoint measure in peripheral neuropathy treatment trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Data from a study of patients with impaired glucose tolerance and neuropathy suggest that serial skin biopsies are more sensitive than other peripheral nerve measures for detecting reinnervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Various techniques to induce cutaneous denervation allow for the study of reinnervation in both normal and pathologic conditions. The most promising technique involves application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> to denervate the skin. Serial biopsies may be performed in the denervated region to study rate of reinnervation, which occurs over several months. Subjects with diabetes have a reduced rate of reinnervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This model holds promise as a means of efficiently studying potential therapeutic agents because relatively few patients can be studied for a short period of time as opposed to longitudinal clinical trials which require large numbers of patients followed over one to two years.</p><p>Skin biopsy is also a useful method to study myelinated nerve function. It is possible to demonstrate abnormal myelin protein expression in dermal nerve fibers using immunohistochemistry. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses revealed morphologic abnormalities, many of which were similar to those observed in sural nerve biopsy tissue, but some of which were unique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Analysis of dermal nerve fibers may prove useful in the study of acquired neuropathies, including inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-for-the-evaluation-of-peripheral-nerve-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1776834\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin biopsy is a relatively benign procedure.
