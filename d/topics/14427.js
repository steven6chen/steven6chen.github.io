In later fibrotic stages, the peripheral blood demonstrates teardrop-shaped red cells (ie, dacrocytes), nucleated red blood cells, and early myeloid forms (ie, a triad termed leukoerythroblastosis), and extramedullary hematopoiesis results in hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. PMF has had numerous names in the past, including agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis.</p><p>The related myeloproliferative neoplasms essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) can both undergo delayed disease transformation into a fibrotic state called post-ET myelofibrosis (post-ET MF) or post-PV MF, respectively. The conversion rates after 10 to 20 years of disease are less than 5 percent for ET and approximately 10 to 20 percent for PV. PMF, post-ET MF, and post-PV MF are all referred to as myelofibrosis (MF).</p><p>The prognosis of PMF will be reviewed here. An overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, as well as discussions of treatment, pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of PMF, are presented separately.

The most recent and internationally recognized is the Dynamic International Prognostic Score Plus (DIPSS Plus). The DIPSS Plus incorporates the patient&rsquo;s age, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, circulating blast percentage, transfusion requirement, karyotype, and constitutional symptoms to assign a risk score, which estimates median survival (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-dynamic-international-prognostic-scoring-system-plus-dipss-plus-for-primary-myelofibrosis-pmf-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105009 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F104430\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104430 \">figure 1</a>).
