Most frequently, the presence of dysuria reflects a urogenital infection such as urethritis, prostatitis, epididymitis, or urinary tract infection. The approach to the workup and treatment of dysuria depends on other features of the patient history and certain clinical findings that may suggest one etiology over another. </p><p>The initial evaluation of the man who presents with dysuria, with a focus on infectious etiologies, is discussed here. Details of the infectious conditions that are associated with this symptom are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethritis-in-adult-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethritis in adult men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults#H3954340778\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Common non-infectious conditions that can also be associated with dysuria, often in association with other symptoms, are also discussed in detail elsewhere.

Dysuria is reported in the majority of men with symptomatic gonorrhea and over half of patients with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethritis-in-adult-men#H1457979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethritis in adult men&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>Both acute and chronic prostatitis can occur in young and middle-aged men. Chronic prostatitis can occur as a complication of acute prostatitis or without any recognized initial infection. Urethral instrumentation and prostatic surgery are known causes of prostatitis, but many patients have no history of a precipitating event. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis#H13503206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis#H14689086\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Isolated acute cystitis does not commonly occur in men. The much lower incidence of cystitis in men, compared to women, has been attributed to less frequent colonization around the urethra due to the drier periurethral environment, increased length of the urethra, and antibacterial substances in prostatic fluid. Most men with acute cystitis have a functional or anatomic abnormality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute bacterial epididymitis is a relatively rare disease, but can cause serious illness. It can be seen in conjunction with acute prostatitis, particularly in older men who may have underlying prostatic obstruction or recent instrumentation as a risk factor. Acute epididymitis can also be due to a sexually acquired infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521955818\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The microbiologic etiologies differ by syndrome and risk of sexually transmitted infection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urethritis</strong> &mdash; Urethritis is generally caused by a sexually transmitted infection, most commonly <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, and <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>. <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>, <em>Ureaplasma urealyticum</em>, and herpes simplex virus are also recognized causative pathogens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethritis-in-adult-men#H1457979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethritis in adult men&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and microbiology'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute bacterial prostatitis</strong> &mdash; Acute prostatitis is most commonly bacterial in origin and caused by gram-negative rods (eg, Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Proteus</em> species) and gram-positive organisms (<em>Enterococci</em>, Staphylococcus aureus). Gonorrhea and chlamydia can also cause acute prostatitis in sexually active men. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic bacterial prostatitis</strong> &mdash; Gram-negative rods, particularly <em>Escherichia coli</em>, are also the most common cause of chronic bacterial prostatitis. Enterococci, <em>S. aureus</em>, and streptococcal species have also been associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis#H14689240\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epididymitis</strong> &mdash; In men younger than 35 years, <em>C. trachomatis</em> is the most common organism responsible for bacterial epididymitis, although gonococcal infection can also contribute to some cases. Sexually transmitted organisms may also be responsible for epididymitis in older men, but bacteriuria secondary to obstructive urinary disease (eg, prostatic hyperplasia) is more common, involving organisms such as <em>E. coli</em> and other coliforms. Men who engage in insertive anal intercourse are at increased risk for epididymitis due to coliform bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-infectious-causes-of-dysuria-in-the-adult-man/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough sexual history should be obtained from all patients with dysuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H602295897\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Assessing risk'</a>.)</p><p>Painful urination is usually the chief complaint in men with urethritis. They may also complain of pruritis or discharge at the urethral meatus. Discharge may be present throughout the day or may be scanty and only present on the first morning void. Men may note the ability to express discharge from the urethra. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethritis-in-adult-men#H1458217\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethritis in adult men&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The typical signs and symptoms of acute bacterial prostatitis are similar to upper urinary tract infection and include fever, chills, malaise, myalgia, dysuria, and cloudy urine. In addition, swelling of the acutely inflamed prostate can cause obstructive symptoms, ranging from dribbling and hesitancy to anuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with chronic prostatitis may have complaints of typical cystitis such as frequency, dysuria, and urgency. However, other subtle symptoms may include perineal discomfort, discomfort during ejaculation, deep pelvic pain, or pain radiating to the back. The diagnosis of prostatitis should be considered in men who have a history of recurrent UTIs in the absence of risk factors, such as bladder catheterization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis#H14689254\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with acute epididymitis often complain of irritative voiding symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency) and pain in one testicle. These localizing symptoms are often accompanied by a history of high fever and rigors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults#H3603594390\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Acute cystitis is indicated by dysuria and other complaints of urinary frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, and cloudy or bloody urine; fever is generally absent in isolated acute cystitis. The presence of upper tract infection is suggested by systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and malaise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should include measurement of temperature and assessment of the general well-being of the patient. Specific attention should be given to a full genital and rectal examination and assessment of tenderness in the costovertebral region.</p><p>The physical examination should include lymph node palpation and inspection and palpation of the testicles and penis. The skin of the entire pubic area, scrotum, groin, and penis should be examined for lesions or genital ulcers. The testes, epididymides, and spermatic cords should be palpated for masses or tenderness. The foreskin should be completely retracted and the urethral meatus should be inspected for crusting, redness, or discharge.</p><p>In patients with suspected urethritis, penile discharge may be mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent in appearance. If there is no apparent urethral discharge noted on physical examination, the urethra can be milked from the base to the meatus by placing the gloved thumb along the ventral surface of the base of the penis and the forefinger on the dorsum and applying gentle pressure. The hand is moved slowly toward the meatus to expel any discharge for specimen collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-infectious-causes-of-dysuria-in-the-adult-man/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethritis-in-adult-men#H1458217\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethritis in adult men&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The typical signs of acute prostatitis notable upon examination include high fevers. The finding of an edematous and tender prostate on physical examination should lead to a presumptive diagnosis of acute prostatitis. The digital rectal examination should be performed in a gentle fashion when acute prostatitis is suspected since vigorous examination can induce bacteremia. The physical exam in patients with chronic prostatitis may be unremarkable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis#H14689254\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with epididymitis, physical examination is usually notable for induration and swelling of the involved epididymis in association with exquisite tenderness. Urologic consultation for possible torsion might be necessary if the onset of pain was sudden and severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-infectious-causes-of-dysuria-in-the-adult-man/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rarely, Fournier's gangrene can present with vague scrotal discomfort and malaise with rapid progression to necrosis. This requires prompt surgical evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with an upper urinary tract infection are often febrile and uncomfortable in appearance; in severe cases, physical examination may be notable for hypotension and flank pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnoses of urethritis, urinary tract infections, bacterial prostatitis, and epididymitis are generally made presumptively on the basis of risk factors, clinical presentations, and physical findings. Additional testing, typically of urine, is required to confirm the clinical diagnoses and determine the microbial etiologies. </p><p>For men with suspected urethritis or epididymitis secondary to a sexually transmitted infection, first-catch urine should be collected for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of urine for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis (</em>and <em>M. genitalium</em>, if available). If Gram staining and microscopy are readily available, demonstration of &ge;2 white blood cells (WBC) per oil immersion field with or without Gram negative diplococci on the Gram stain (or intracellular diplococci on a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentian-violet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentian violet</a></span> stain) of a urethral swab can confirm the diagnosis of urethritis at the point of care. Persistent symptoms of urethritis despite empiric treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia suggest re-infection or infection with a nongonococcal, nonchlamydial cause of sexually transmitted urethritis (in order of prevalence, <em>M. genitalium</em>, <em>T. vaginalis</em>, and <em>U. urealyticum</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-infectious-causes-of-dysuria-in-the-adult-man/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In such cases, specific NAATs for these organisms may be warranted, but are not widely available for use in men. Further, men who engage in receptive anal intercourse should have a rectal swab obtained for NAAT for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em>.</p><p>In men with suspected prostatitis or urinary tract infection, a urinalysis and a midstream urine culture should be collected to confirm the diagnosis. A urine culture should also be obtained in all men suspected of having acute epididymitis. Blood cultures may be helpful in the patient with systemic signs and symptoms of infection.
