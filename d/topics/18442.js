A common tissue extraction technique is morcellation (cutting a specimen into small pieces). Initially, morcellation was performed using a scalpel at the time of vaginal procedures or laparotomy. As laparoscopic techniques were adopted, there was the advent of electro-mechanical morcellators (also referred to as electro-mechanical morcellators) that utilize rapidly rotating blades to quickly core and remove specimens during laparoscopic or robotic procedures. In 2014, concerns were raised that morcellation may disseminate tumor cells in cases in which an undiagnosed uterine malignancy was present. This prompted action by the US Food and Drug Administration, new guidelines for the use of electro-mechanical morcellators, and a decrease in use of these devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-tissue-extraction-by-morcellation-techniques-and-clinical-issues/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].</p><p>Uterine morcellation techniques are reviewed here.

This is typically performed to remove a large tissue specimen through a small incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electro-mechanical morcellation &ndash; Morcellation of tissue with an electric device. This is usually used only in laparoscopic procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalpel morcellation &ndash; Morcellation of tissue using a scalpel. The specimen is cut into fewer pieces, and pieces are less likely to be distributed throughout the abdomen or left in the abdomen after surgery in contrast with electro-mechanical morcellation. In gynecologic surgery, this is typically done to remove a bulky uterine specimen during vaginal hysterectomy and sometimes during a myomectomy or hysterectomy through a minilaparotomy incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraperitoneal morcellation &ndash; Tissue morcellation is performed within the peritoneal cavity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraperitoneal morcellation &ndash; A type of scalpel morcellation in which the specimen is grasped and brought to the intraperitoneal side of a minilaparotomy incision. It is then partially exteriorized (ie, the specimen is grasped on the other side and pulled through the incision so that it is extraperitoneal). The extraperitoneal part is then excised, and the process is repeated until the entire specimen has been removed. This has also been termed extracorporeal morcellation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In-bag containment system &ndash; Intraperitoneal bag used in laparoscopic surgery; morcellation is performed within bag.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479668437\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue morcellation is performed in gynecologic surgery when a large tissue specimen must be removed through a small incision. This is done to facilitate less invasive surgical approaches, including vaginal or laparoscopic surgery. Morcellation is typically performed when the preoperative diagnosis is uterine fibroids because of the extensive uterine enlargement characteristic of this disease. The gynecologic procedures that typically use morcellation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic hysterectomy &ndash; When total laparoscopic hysterectomy is performed, the uterus may be morcellated or removed via the vaginal incision. Depending on the size of the uterus, the specimen may be removed intact or may require scalpel morcellation. Subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomy requires morcellation, however, since there is no vaginal incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic myomectomy &ndash; Removal of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal hysterectomy &ndash; If the uterine specimen is too large to remove via the vaginal incision, scalpel morcellation is performed.</p><p/><p>Use of morcellation in other surgical specialties is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H38924954\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Morcellators'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1348906413\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS OF MORCELLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of uterine morcellation raises several concerns, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissemination of tissue &ndash; If an unsuspected malignancy is present, morcellated uterine tissue may result in spillage and spread of cancer cells, thus leading to an advanced stage and potentially a worsened prognosis. This is of particular concern with electro-mechanical morcellators, since use of these devices results in multiple tissue fragments, and the rotational force of the device may distribute the fragments around the peritoneal cavity. However, scalpel morcellation or any other type of disruption of uterine tissue (supracervical hysterectomy, myomectomy) may lead to tissue spread. Dissemination of tissue can also occur with nonmalignant tissues, such as endometriosis and myomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas#H2044320039\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Do techniques that disrupt a mass disseminate tissue and worsen prognosis?'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disruption of the tissue specimen for pathology evaluation &ndash; Morcellated tissue is in fragments; thus, gross pathology, relationship of fragments to each other and the uterus, and margins are not clear, and pathologic evaluation may be difficult. Morcellation impacts the ability to determine specimen size and renders problematic determining depth of invasion of carcinoma (if present) and presence of circumscription (eg, in order to distinguish endometrial stromal nodule from endometrial stromal sarcoma) and may impact the ability to identify features such as degree of necrosis (due to cautery).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical complications &ndash; Electro-mechanical morcellators must be used carefully to avoid injury to adjacent structures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H225584146\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue dissemination and worsened prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main concern regarding uterine morcellation is the dissemination of tissue in women operated on for presumed benign leiomyomas who are found postoperatively to have uterine sarcoma or other malignancy. This is a clinical challenge, since leiomyomas are very common (lifetime prevalence of 70 percent in white women and 80 percent in black women) and are difficult to differentiate preoperatively from uterine sarcoma, which is a rare and aggressive malignancy. In addition, women with no uterine mass who undergo surgery for benign indications may have an unsuspected uterine cancer. The concern regarding morcellation has broadened beyond dissemination of uterine sarcomas to encompass dissemination of other benign and malignant lesions from intraperitoneal morcellation (leiomyoma variants and endometrial carcinoma).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2872946855\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine sarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In studies and systematic reviews of women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy for presumed benign leiomyomas, the prevalence of sarcoma is approximately 0.20 percent (1 in 500) in most studies or reviews, and estimates of the prevalence range from 0.05 (1 in 2000) to 0.28 percent (1 in 352) depending upon which studies are included or excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-tissue-extraction-by-morcellation-techniques-and-clinical-issues/abstract/7-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-22</a>]. The majority of cases are leiomyosarcoma, a highly aggressive cancer, but there are also reports of cases of endometrial stromal sarcoma, generally a more indolent cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas#H1449739470\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Prevalence of sarcoma in women undergoing surgery for benign indications'</a>.)</p><p>Morcellation of uterine sarcoma appears to be associated with a worsened prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-tissue-extraction-by-morcellation-techniques-and-clinical-issues/abstract/18,23-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23-30</a>]. However, there are few data, and the available studies often include both scalpel and electro-mechanical morcellation with hysterectomy or for myomectomy.

Differentiating uterine leiomyomas from sarcomas is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H871268514\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electro-mechanical morcellation is an option only for <strong>selected premenopausal women</strong> with uterine fibroids and no significant uterine sarcoma risk factors or clinical features suspicious for uterine malignancy. For those patients who desire uterine preservation and are candidates for <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> myomectomy, we offer patients myomectomy with morcellation rather than myomectomy via laparotomy. For those who desire laparoscopic hysterectomy and in whom intact removal of the specimen through the vagina is not possible, we offers laparoscopic hysterectomy with morcellation rather than laparotomy.</p><p>An area of uncertainty regarding morcellation is how to manage perimenopausal women; the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises against electro-mechanical morcellation in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. The perimenopausal transition can occur over approximately eight years, extending from the time of regular menstrual cycles to the final menstrual period (which is not considered final until one year has passed) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 1</a>). However, there is no evidence that perimenopausal women are at an increased risk of uterine sarcoma, and in fact there are women in this phase who do not know they have entered perimenopause. The principal basis of the increased risk in menopausal women is that uterine fibroids are unlikely to increase in size or become symptomatic in a hypoestrogenic state, which is not the case during the menopausal transition, during which hormone levels can fluctuate significantly. Thus, we suggest that, for this purpose of this topic, women be considered perimenopausal if they have significant menstrual irregularity with amenorrhea &gt;60 days, consistent with the late menopausal transition phase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the FDA advises against electro-mechanical morcellation in women who are candidates for en bloc tissue removal (removal of the entire uterus and cervix without any disruption of the specimen). This mainly applies to total hysterectomy, and en bloc tissue removal is preferable whenever possible. It is often possible to do this using a less invasive approach if the uterus is small. In a vaginal hysterectomy or total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the uterus may be able to be removed intact via the vaginal incision.</p><p>However, if intact removal is not possible, then the choice is between morcellation or laparotomy. For women who have no significant risk factors for uterine sarcoma, use of laparotomy rather than a less invasive approach solely to avoid morcellation may expose women to higher risks of morbidity and mortality and certainly to a longer recovery period that may affect quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-tissue-extraction-by-morcellation-techniques-and-clinical-issues/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>In addition, for women who desire uterine preservation, myomectomy using any surgical approach generally involves a great deal of disruption of the specimen(s). If future childbearing is desired, hysterectomy is not an option. There are no data regarding whether laparoscopic myomectomy with electro-mechanical morcellation or open myomectomy result in a differential risk of tissue dissemination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas#H3022653371\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Myomectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be counseled about medical and surgical treatment options. In appropriately selected and counseled patients, if morcellation is an option, patient preference should be a major determining factor regarding whether this is used. Based upon appropriate counseling regarding risks and benefits of morcellation versus laparotomy, the patient can then make an informed choice regarding the surgical approach.</p><p>If a surgical option using electro-mechanical morcellation is elected, counseling should include the risk of dissemination of malignant cells if a malignancy is incidentally detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-tissue-extraction-by-morcellation-techniques-and-clinical-issues/abstract/46,47,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47,61-63</a>].
