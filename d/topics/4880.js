Deep vein thrombosis, or &quot;DVT&quot; for short, can be dangerous.</p><p>If a blood clot forms inside a blood vessel, it can clog the vessel and keep blood from getting where it needs to go. When that happens to 1 of the veins deep within the leg, blood can back up and cause swelling and pain.</p><p>Another problem with blood clots in veins is that they can travel to other parts of the body and clog blood vessels there. Blood clots that form in the legs, for example, can end up blocking blood vessels in the lungs. This can make it hard to breathe and sometimes, when they are large, can lead to death. When blood clots travel to the lungs doctors call it &quot;pulmonary embolism&quot; or &quot;PE.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384238878\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of DVT?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DVT can cause the following symptoms in the involved leg:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warmth and redness</p><p/><p>Sometimes clots form in the veins that are closer to the surface of the skin, called the &quot;superficial veins.&quot; Those blood clots cause a different set of symptoms. Blood clots in the veins near the surface of the skin are more painful and cause redness or infection. These clots sometimes also cause the veins to harden and bulge into ridges that look like cords. This is most common with the veins below the knee.</p><p>If you think you have a blood clot in your leg, call your doctor or nurse right away. Blood clots in the veins near the surface of the skin are less dangerous. But blood clots in the deep veins of the leg are more serious. Your doctor or nurse can run tests to find out if you do have a clot that needs to be treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384238885\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of blood clots in the lungs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood clots in the lungs can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panting, shortness of breath, or trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharp, knife-like chest pain when you breathe in or strain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing or coughing up blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rapid heartbeat</p><p/><p>If you get any of these symptoms, especially if they happen over a short period of time (hours or days) or get worse quickly, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. At the hospital, doctors can run tests to find out if you do have a clot. Blood clots in the lungs can lead to death. That's why it's important to act fast and find out if there is a clot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384238892\"><span class=\"h1\">How is DVT treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DVT is treated with medicines that keep the clot from getting bigger and travelling to the lung. Some of these medicines come in shots and others come in pills. Most people being treated for a blood clot in the leg are treated first in the hospital.</p><p>People who have had clots are usually put on medicines to prevent future blood clots. These medicines are called &quot;anticoagulants,&quot; &quot;blood thinners,&quot; or &quot;anti-clotting medicines.&quot; Almost everyone is put on an anti-clotting medicine that comes in a pill for at least 3 months (and usually longer). Some people are put on a medicine that is injected under the skin called heparin. This might be for a few days, or longer if for some reason they can't take pills.</p><p>Anti-clotting medicines do not dissolve existing blood clots, but they do keep them from getting bigger. They also help keep new blood clots from forming. Being on an anti-clotting medicine for a few months is important because it gives the body time to dissolve the old clot. It's also important because people who have a clot are at risk of developing another clot, especially in the first few months.</p><p>There are a few different anti-clotting medicines that come in pill form. They include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> (brand name: Coumadin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rivaroxaban</a> (brand name: Xarelto), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">apixaban</a> (brand name: Eliquis), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">edoxaban</a> (brand name: Savaysa), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dabigatran</a> (brand name: Pradaxa) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F99882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99882 \">table 1</a>). If your doctor puts you on an anti-clotting medicine, take it exactly as directed. If you forget or miss a dose, call your doctor to find out what to do. When you start taking an anti-clotting medicine, you will need to have your blood tested. If you are taking warfarin, you will need regular blood tests to check how your blood is clotting. If there are changes in your medical condition or test results your doctor might need to adjust your dose. At the wrong doses, the drug can either stop working or lead to serious bleeding. In fact, bleeding is a risk with all the anti-clotting medicines, so you and your doctor should also always watch out for signs of bleeding.</p><p>People who cannot take medicines to treat clots, or who do not get enough benefit from the medicines, can get a different treatment. This is called an &quot;inferior vena cava filter&quot; (also called an IVC filter). The inferior vena cava is the large vein that carries blood from your legs and the lower half of your body back up to your heart. IVC filters go inside the inferior vena cava. They filter and trap any large clots that form below the location of the filter. Your doctor might suggest one of these filters for you if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cannot safely take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> or another anti-clotting medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You form clots even while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> or another anti-clotting medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a dangerous bleeding problem while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> or another anti-clotting medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are so sick that if a blood clot that travels from your legs to your lungs it could kill you</p><p/><p>In some cases, a person has a clot that is severe enough to cause gangrene (cut off the blood supply to your leg). If this happens, doctors can give medicine to dissolve the clot. This is sometimes called &quot;clot busting&quot; medicine, and is given through a catheter (a small tube inserted into the vein). In some cases, doctors will do surgery to remove the clot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30569558\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything on my own to prevent blood clots?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. People sometimes form clots because they have been sitting still for too long. People who travel on long airplane flights, for example, are at increased risk of blood clots. Here are some things you can do to help prevent a clot during a long flight:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stand up and walk around every 1 to 2 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not smoke just before your trip</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear loose, comfortable clothes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shift your position while seated, and move your legs and feet often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink plenty of fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear knee-high compression stockings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol and medicines that make you sleepy, because they can impair your ability to move around</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384238906\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-direct-oral-anticoagulants-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Direct oral anticoagulants (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-warfarin-coumadin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Warfarin (Coumadin) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=staying-healthy-when-you-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Staying healthy when you travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-can-go-wrong-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What can go wrong after a heart attack?
