The meninges consist of three parts: the pia, arachnoid, and dura mater. Meningitis reflects inflammation of the arachnoid mater and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in both the subarachnoid space and in the cerebral ventricles.</p><p>Suspected bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency, and immediate diagnostic steps must be taken to establish the specific cause so that appropriate antimicrobial therapy can be initiated. The mortality rate of untreated bacterial meningitis approaches 100 percent. Even with optimal therapy, morbidity and mortality may occur. Neurologic sequelae are common among survivors.</p><p>The clinical and laboratory features of bacterial meningitis in infants and children older than one month will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of acute meningitis and the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in neonates (&lt;1 month of age) and adults are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Causative organisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain host factors may predispose to bacterial meningitis with a particular organism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72293 \">table 2</a>). Additional risk factors for bacterial meningitis include exposure to someone with meningococcal or <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib) meningitis, cochlear implantation device, recent neurosurgical procedure, or anatomic defect (dermal sinus or urinary tract anomaly). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with bacterial meningitis present with fever and symptoms and signs of meningeal inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94546%7EPEDS%2F94547\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef94546 graphicRef94547 \">movie 1A-B</a>). However, the clinical manifestations of bacterial meningitis are variable and nonspecific; no single sign is pathognomonic. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency, and immediate diagnostic steps must be taken to establish the specific cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74865\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74865 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory evaluation of children with suspected meningitis should include a complete blood count with differential and platelet count, two aerobic blood cultures, and serum electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Evaluation of clotting function is especially indicated if petechiae or purpuric lesions are noted. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Blood tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture should be performed on any child in whom, after careful history and physical examination, the diagnosis of meningitis is suspected unless specific contraindications to lumbar puncture are present. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should include cell count and differential, glucose and protein concentration, Gram stain, and culture. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'CSF examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is a contraindication to or inability to perform a lumbar puncture or if the lumbar puncture is delayed by the need for cranial imaging, blood cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics administered as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'CSF examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory findings characteristic of bacterial meningitis include CSF pleocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, elevated CSF protein, decreased CSF glucose, the presence of an organism on CSF Gram stain, and isolation of a pathogenic organism from the CSF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood culture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76324 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of CSF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolation of a bacterial pathogen from the CSF (by culture or other diagnostic techniques) confirms the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children who were treated with antibiotics before CSF was obtained, increased CSF cell count, elevated CSF protein concentration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased CSF glucose concentration usually are sufficient to establish the diagnosis of meningitis; blood cultures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapid diagnostic tests may help to identify the pathogenic organism. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of CSF in pretreated patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis (a third-generation cephalosporin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a>) should be initiated immediately after the results of lumbar puncture are received or immediately after the lumbar puncture is performed if the clinical suspicion for bacterial meningitis is high. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of empiric therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Empiric therapy'</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Thigpen MC, Whitney CG, Messonnier NE, et al.
