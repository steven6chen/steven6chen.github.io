The pathologic changes in this disorder are described elsewhere.

Although few clues are evident, there appears to be a genetic susceptibility, an overlap with other disorders associated with immunologic abnormalities, and the potential for multiple inciting events including chemical insults. This hypothesis is supported by a series of observations which imply that RPC is not a primary disease but a syndrome associated with multiple precipitating factors that appear in a genetically susceptible subject. The paraneoplastic myelodysplastic relationship suggests a potential pathophysiologic role for clonally expressed lymphoid stem cells in which functional T cell defects induce both autoimmunity and uncontrolled neoplastic hematopoietic clonal proliferation. However, a report of abrupt onset after recreational drug abuse implies that a direct biochemical insult also can induce the disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetic susceptibility'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Association with other immunologic diseases'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11225833\" class=\"local\">'Induction by toxins'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No association of RPC with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (HLA-A and HLA-B) antigens has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, an association has been described between RPC and HLA class II, specifically with HLA-DR4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Genetic analysis of the frequency of HLA class II histocompatibility antigens was performed in 60 central European Caucasian patients with RPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; the frequency of HLA-DR4 was 56 percent compared with 26 percent in a healthy control group. Genotyping showed no preferential association of specific DR4 subtype alleles, in contrast to the clear association of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with DRB1*0401 and DRB1*0404 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These RA-associated alleles have in common a region of highly similar sequence, designated the shared epitope (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and other susceptibility genes in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>). Further, a novel DR4 allele (DRB1*0421), has been identified in a single patient with RPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, although RPC and RA may share clinical and immunologic features and, at times, may coexist, the contribution of HLA-DRB1*04 alleles to disease may differ between these two disorders. </p><p>Another observation made in one of these studies was a negative association between HLA-DR6 positivity and clinical features of RPC, including extent of organ involvement and specific organ manifestations (such as general symptoms and nasal chondritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. HLA-DR6-positive patients also had a higher median age at disease onset compared with HLA-DR6-negative patients. The importance of this relationship is unclear and remains speculative.</p><p>A role for HLA class II DQ alleles has been suggested by one study that evaluated HLA class II allelic distribution among 64 unrelated Caucasian RPC patients compared with 507 unrelated healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The following allele frequencies were significantly increased in RPC: DQB1*0601 (4.7 versus 0.9 percent), DQA1*0103 (15.6 versus 7.9 percent) and DQA1*0301 (22.7 versus 12.9 percent). In addition, 59 percent of patients expressed the DQA1*0103 or 0301 allele compared with 38 percent of controls. This is further supported by the report that double transgenic mice which express both <span class=\"nowrap\">DQA1*0301/DQB1*0302</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">DQA1*0103/DQB1*0601</span> class II molecules develop severe experimental RPC following immunization with type II collagen. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Genetic predisposition in experimental models'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with other immunologic diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a frequent association of RPC with a diverse array of connective tissue, endocrine, and inflammatory bowel diseases in which immunologic mechanisms are believed to have a prominent role in pathogenesis. These include systemic necrotizing forms of vasculitis, Graves' disease, and ulcerative colitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81401 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-relapsing-polychondritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of relapsing polychondritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is also an increased prevalence, particularly in older men, of myelodysplastic syndromes in patients with RPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], with 5 of 18 patients being affected in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These clonal stem cell disorders are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and are themselves associated with a relatively high incidence of immunologic abnormalities including immunoglobulin dyscrasias, autoantibody formation, and abnormalities in the function of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Both diseases are usually detected simultaneously. These correlations suggest a real association, but its nature is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H2301305\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11225833\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction by toxins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A disease simulating RPC <span class=\"nowrap\">(auricular/nasal</span> cartilage inflammation, scleritis, audiovestibular, and peripheral and axial joint involvement) appeared within 24 hours of an intravenous injection of a preheated multiple substance &quot;cocktail&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This cocktail included hydrochloric acid, carburetor fluid, the waxy internal matrix of a mentholated nasal inhaler, and tap water. This bizarre event is reminiscent of early experimental studies showing that intravenously injected crude papain could induce collapse of the normally rigid ears of young rabbits within four hours of administration, followed in some animals by respiratory distress caused by tracheal and bronchial collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In addition to the association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4, the following observations are consistent with this hypothesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of autoimmunity, both antibody and cell-mediated, to extracellular matrix components of cartilage such as types II, IX and XI collagen, matrilin-1, and proteoglycan constituent fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some observations support the contribution of a cell-mediated immune reaction to type II collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As an example, T cell clones isolated from a <span class=\"nowrap\">DRB1*0101/0401</span> heterozygous patient with relapsing polychondritis (RPC) showed specificity to a peptide derived from type II collagen that is an immunodominant epitope in a transgenic mouse model with features of RPC. Of further interest are differences found in the epitope specificity for type II collagen antibody identified in patients with rheumatoid arthritis versus RPC. Response in the rheumatoid patients was directed to an evolutionary conserved type II collagen domain that is also targeted by pathogenic autoimmune responses in murine models of arthritis but not RPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prominence of HLA-DR-positive antigen-presenting cells and CD4-positive T lymphocytes at lesional sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cartilage destruction may also be mediated by induction of apoptosis in chondrocytes.

In animal models, immunization to matrilin-1 can induce an RPC-like syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Matrilin-1'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Proteoglycan-shared epitopes are diversely distributed and can be found in a variety of tissues including connective tissue of aortic media and intima, the anterior uveal tract, heart valves, the endoneurium and perineurium of the optic nerves, the tracheal submucosal basement membrane, endothelial cells, glomerular and tubular basement membranes, myocardial sarcolemma, and synoviocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/18-21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21,24</a>].</p><p>Of speculative interest is the antigenic crossreactivity between cartilage proteoglycans, streptococcal peptidoglycans, and the purified protein derivative of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In this context, a monoclonal antibody derived from peripheral blood B cells of a patient with RPC reacted with a purified cytoskeletal antigen (desmin), type II collagen, and proteoglycans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Crossreactivity of this antibody to heat shock protein 60 obtained from <em>M. tuberculosis</em> was also shown. The possibility that an exogenous antigen induces an antibody capable of cross-reacting with autoantigens and thus contributing to the pathogenic process cannot be dismissed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic predisposition in experimental models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rodents and primates immunized with native type II or XI cartilage collagen may develop a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted destructive arthropathy which correlates both with the expression of antibodies specific for conformational determinants of collagen and cell-mediated immune responses which lack conformational or collagen type specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. It is unclear as to whether T cells alone can induce arthritis, although they are likely to have a major role in sustaining the process. An auricular chondritis may develop later in the postimmunization period, independent of the expression of arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>These responses appear to be under multiple gene control which is, in part, linked to the Ir region of the MHC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. This region is thought to be responsible for regulation of the expression, severity, and rate of progression of disease. An imbalance of T-helper cell subsets may play an important role in the development of cartilage destruction in this model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, there are no ocular, laryngotracheobronchial, or cardiovascular lesions in collagen-induced arthritis, as there are in human RPC.</p><p>The role of DQ class II molecules in the antigenic presentation of type II collagen and subsequent initiation of collagen-induced arthritis has been studied using transgenic mice lacking endogenous HLA class II molecular expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These HLA molecules, which are expressed on the cell surface, can positively select CD4+ T cells expressing various V beta T cell receptors. Transgenic mice that express DQ8 develop severe arthritis in response to collagen immunization; by comparison, DQ6 mice are unresponsive. Double transgenic mice expressing both DQ6 and DQ8 develop severe RPC following type II collagen immunization, exhibiting both polyarthritis and auricular chondritis. Older mice bearing both DQ6 and DQ8 develop chondritis spontaneously (in the absence of collagen immunization or adjuvant administration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Expression of DQ8 in mice with a nonobese diabetic (NOD) genotype and lacking endogenous class II molecules is also associated with a susceptibility to type II collagen-immunization-induced chondritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In this transgenic strain, immunization with type II collagen produces auricular cartilage inflammation in a larger proportion of animals and also produces an antibody response to both type II and type IX collagen. Immunization of this mouse strain with type IX collagen frequently leads to chondritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Matrilin-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other models have used cartilage matrix protein (matrilin-1) as the immunogen in an attempt to replicate the tissue distribution of lesions in RPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Matrilin-1 is primarily expressed in skeletal growth cartilage during development but is limited to the nasal septum, trachea, auricular, and xiphisternal cartilage in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Immunization of rats with this protein produces severe inspiratory stridor due to tracheal involvement, nasal swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epistaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Female rats were more susceptible than males. All strains mount a strong IgG anti-matrilin-1 response, but only some strains develop disease. Using congenic mouse strains, the likelihood of developing disease appears to be governed by both MHC and non-MHC genes, and is dependent upon alpha beta T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Mice devoid of interleukin (IL)-10 through gene deletion develop a significantly more severe disease with earlier onset.</p><p>Further studies using the matrilin-1 model have shown both an antibody- and complement-dependent basis for RPC development. Neither specific antibody nor disease could be induced in matrilin-1 immunized mice deficient of B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. B-cell deficient mice injected with matrilin-1 specific antibody developed erosive respiratory tract chondritis. Respiratory distress occurred significantly less in matrilin-1 immunized mice congenic at complement factor 5, indicating the potential importance of, although not an absolute requirement for, functional C5.</p><p>The applicability of these findings to humans is uncertain. Matrilin-1 fragments have been identified in the serum of a patient with RPC during active inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were documented in other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41</a>]. Anti-matrilin antibodies are present in a minority of patients with RPC. This was illustrated by a study of the sera of 97 patients obtained at a single time point in their disease course; 13 of 97 had IgG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IgM anti-matrilin-1 antibody; positive responses correlated with respiratory symptoms in 69 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, 40 percent of patients having clinical evidence of laryngotracheal involvement did not have an anti-matrilin-1 antibody response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic pathways mediating cartilage degradation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immune response and subsequent release of cytokines may be responsible for cartilage destruction in RPC.

A set of circulating cytokines levels were contrasted between patients with active RPC, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and healthy control subjects. Mean serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1 beta), and IL-8 were significantly higher in patients with RPC than controls. The profile in rheumatoid arthritis differed, showing a more generalized pattern of upregulation of multiple cytokines rather than the more discrete elevations observed in RPC. Each of the three cytokines increased in RPC is a proinflammatory chemokine; MCP-1 and MIP-1 beta function to recruit and activate circulating <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophages</span>. IL-8 is produced by activated <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophages,</span> acting in part to attract neutrophils.

As an example, basic fibroblast growth factor, an integral part of this network, upregulates IL-1 and TNF receptors.

Genetic susceptibility is suggested by the association between RPC and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4 or other HLA class II alleles. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetic susceptibility'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a frequent association of RPC with a diverse array of immune-mediated connective tissue, endocrine, and inflammatory bowel diseases, including systemic necrotizing forms of vasculitis, Graves' disease, and ulcerative colitis. There is also an increased prevalence, particularly in older men, of myelodysplastic syndromes in patients with RPC. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Association with other immunologic diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is evidence of autoimmunity, both antibody- and cell-mediated, to extracellular matrix components of cartilage, including types II, IX and XI collagen, matrilin-1, and proteoglycan constituent fractions. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunogenicity of cartilage'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Matrilin-1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings include the prominence of HLA-DR-positive antigen-presenting cells and CD4-positive T lymphocytes at lesional sites, and selective decreases in the number and function of natural killer regulatory T cells. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experimental induction of features of RPC following immunization of experimental animals with connective tissue antigens is genetically regulated. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Genetic predisposition in experimental models'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RPC is hypothesized to result from exposure of modified or immunologically privileged connective tissue or cell membrane epitopes by an unknown inciting event, leading to an inflammatory and genetically conditioned immune response. The response to injury may perpetuate enzymatic and oxygen metabolite-mediated connective tissue degradation and subsequent release of cytokines, which may be responsible for cartilage destruction.
