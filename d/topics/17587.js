The organism classically responsible for the enteric fever syndrome is <em>Salmonella</em> <em>enterica</em> serotype Typhi (formerly <em>S</em>. <em>typhi</em>). Other <em>Salmonella</em> serotypes, particularly <em>S. enterica</em> serotypes Paratyphi A, B, or C, can cause a similar syndrome; however, it is usually not clinically useful or possible to reliably predict the causative organism based on clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Genome sequencing and analysis of international isolates has identified a predominant MDR <em>S. </em>Typhi strain, H58, that has disseminated throughout Asia and Africa, displacing more susceptible strains and driving ongoing MDR epidemics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>However, some locations have reported a decrease in the prevalence of MDR strains.

In an analysis of over 1000 isolates submitted to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 2008 and 2012, most of which were from infections acquired in South Asia, 12 percent of <em>S. </em>Typhi and no <em>S. </em>Paratyphi isolates were MDR strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A similar prevalence of MDR strains was reported from a surveillance study in Switzerland between 2002 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluoroquinolone nonsusceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, resistance to the early generation quinolone nalidixic acid served as an important marker for decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. However, because of the emergence of newer mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance, some isolates may appear to be sensitive to nalidixic acid but still have decreased sensitivity to clinically important fluoroquinolones, calling into question the reliability of using nalidixic acid resistance as a marker of fluoroquinolone resistance. As a result, both the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in the United States and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) have revised the fluoroquinolone breakpoints for extra-intestinal <em>Salmonella</em> isolates. CLSI standards now designate the following breakpoints for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> susceptibility in <em>Salmonella</em> isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) &le;0.064 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> &ndash; susceptible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MIC 0.125 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> &ndash; intermediate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MIC &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> &ndash; resistant (formerly MIC 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span></p><p/><p>In many parts of South Asia, the majority of <em>S. </em>Typhi isolated among clinical cases is nonsusceptible to fluoroquinolones. A randomized trial in Nepal comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gatifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gatifloxacin</a>, a fluoroquinolone that had proven highly successful in the country just several years prior, had to be terminated early due to high rates of treatment failure in the gatifloxacin arm, which was associated with fluoroquinolone nonsusceptibility. In contrast, fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptibility appears less common in other parts of the world. In one multi-country study in Africa, fluoroquinolone nonsusceptibility was only documented in one (Kenya) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] of six countries performing surveillance. More recently, fluoroquinolone resistant isolates have been reported in Nigeria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Increasing rates of full resistance to fluoroquinolones have also been reported; in some cases, these resistant isolates have been classified as a subclass of the MDR H58 typhoid strain that had widely disseminated throughout Asia and some African countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A compilation of studies showed rates of fully quinolone-resistant organisms ranged from 0 to 13 percent, with cases reported from India, Korea, and Nepal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a systematic review of studies from Nepal, the pooled rates of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> resistance increased in both <em>S. </em>Typhi and <em>S. </em>Paratyphi A, from 1.6 and 3.9 percent in 1998 to 2002 to 10.6 and 14.3 percent in 2008 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Isolated cases of high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin have also been reported from India in both <em>S. </em>Paratyphi and <em>S. </em>Typhi (MICs of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

Antibiotic selection depends upon the severity of illness, local resistance patterns, whether oral medications are feasible, the clinical setting, and available resources. The optimal choice of drug and duration of therapy are uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. The main options are fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>. In some circumstances, older agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> may be appropriate, but these drugs are generally not used widely because of the prevalence of resistance. Oral chloramphenicol is no longer available in the United States but is still used in other parts of the world. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H959998367\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When treating presumptively for enteric fever or before results of susceptibility testing are available, appropriate options for empiric therapy depend, in part, on the severity of disease and the risk of infection with an antibiotic-resistant isolate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671911949\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe or complicated disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have severe disease (eg, systemic toxicity, depressed consciousness, prolonged fever, organ system dysfunction, or other feature that prompts hospitalization), initial therapy with a parenteral agent is appropriate. We suggest empiric therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> in such cases. If ceftriaxone is not available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> is a reasonable alternative. Although some studies have demonstrated slower time to defervescence with cephalosporins (compared with fluoroquinolones), frank resistance to the third generation cephalosporins is rare, and so ceftriaxone is likely to be an effective empiric agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In situations where the risk of decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is low (eg, disease not acquired from South Asia), a parenteral fluoroquinolone is also an appropriate alternative. </p><p>Antibiotic doses and durations are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109995 \">table 1</a>). Once symptoms improve, the patient can be transitioned to an oral agent, selected based on results of susceptibility testing, if available. Oral options and data evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic options for enteric fever are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H2150544001\" class=\"local\">'Directed therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Adjunctive corticosteroid is an additional consideration for patients with severe enteric fever.

Appropriate options for empiric therapy in such patients depend on the risk of infection with an antibiotic-resistant isolate, which differs based on the geographical area where infection was acquired. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fluoroquinolone nonsusceptibility'</a> above.)</p><p>Fluoroquinolones (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>) are the drugs of choice for empiric therapy when infection is expected to be fluoroquinolone susceptible. This includes infection acquired in most areas of sub-Saharan Africa (except for Kenya and Nigeria). However, since fluoroquinolone resistance has emerged quickly in some areas, susceptibility testing and continued surveillance of local resistance rates is recommended to guide empiric treatment. Although fluoroquinolones are not recommended for routine use in children in the United States because of arthropathy and cartilage toxicity in exposed immature animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], clinical studies have not demonstrated sustained injury to developing bones or joints in children treated with available fluoroquinolones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Thus, fluoroquinolone use in children is acceptable for severe infection, such as enteric fever, when alternatives are not available or appropriate.</p><p>In contrast, for empiric oral therapy of patients with infections acquired in South Asia or other areas with a high risk of reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (eg, nalidixic acid resistance), we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, which achieves excellent intracellular concentrations and has established efficacy.</p><p>Infection with an isolate with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is associated with longer time to defervescence and higher rates of treatment failure with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gatifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gatifloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/29,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36-39</a>]. Over a period of 10 years, fluoroquinolone effectiveness markedly declined in this setting as resistance emerged; at the same time, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> remained effective and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were low and declining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Resistance to azithromycin remains rare. </p><p>However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> may be costly or unavailable in certain parts of the world, and parenteral therapy may not be necessary for many uncomplicated infections. In such cases, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefixime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefixime</a> is another alternative, but it has some drawbacks (see <a href=\"#H897245437\" class=\"local\">'Fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible infection'</a> below).

However, such testing may be technically challenging, especially in resource-limited settings. Moreover, the diagnosis of enteric fever is often presumptive, without isolation of an organism. In cases in which susceptibility testing cannot be performed, options depend on the likelihood of antimicrobial resistance (see <a href=\"#H959998367\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above). Infectious disease consultation is warranted for such cases if clinicians are not familiar with enteric fever and its treatment.</p><p>There are no trials demonstrating that combination antimicrobial therapy is superior to monotherapy for enteric fever.

Of the fluoroquinolones, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a> are widely available and effective. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Norfloxacin</a> is very poorly absorbed and should not be used. If a fluoroquinolone cannot be used, alternatives include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> and third generation cephalosporins. (See <a href=\"#H897245437\" class=\"local\">'Fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Fluoroquinolones are bactericidal, are concentrated intracellularly and in the bile, and result in rapid elimination of intracellular bacteria. They are more effective than beta-lactams against susceptible organisms.

Chronic carriage is typically identified through public health mandated screening of food handlers or health care personnel following enteric fever or during an investigation of an outbreak or case in nonendemic areas.</p><p>Chronic carriage rates after <em>S. </em>Typhi infection range from 1 to 6 percent; rates are higher in patients with cholelithiasis or other biliary tract abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

For travelers, the main mechanism of transmission is ingestion of the local cuisine or water in areas where sanitation and personal hygiene may be poor. The inoculum in food is likely higher than that in contaminated water. Thus, food and water safety is an essential preventive strategy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=travel-advice#H22624029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Travel advice&quot;, section on 'Food and water'</a>.) </p><p>Typhoid vaccination is also indicated in travelers and other individuals with risk for exposure, but available vaccines are not entirely protective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Typhoid vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two commercially available vaccines for protection against <em>S. </em>Typhi: live oral <em>S. </em>Typhi vaccine strain Ty21a and parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine. Neither is completely effective against <em>S. </em>Typhi and neither provides protection against paratyphoid fever caused by <em>S. </em>Paratyphi A. There is some evidence that the Ty21a vaccine may confer partial protection against <em>S. </em>Paratyphi B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. </p><p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, efficacy at one and two years was 35 and 58 percent for the oral vaccine and 69 and 59 percent for the parenteral vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Most adverse effects associated with either vaccine were mild (eg, fever or injection site pain or swelling).</p><p>Thus, for individuals in nonendemic areas at risk for exposure, typhoid vaccination may provide some protection. In the United States, typhoid vaccination is recommended for travelers (even short-term travelers) to areas where there is risk of exposure to <em>S. </em>Typhi<em>, </em>for individuals with intimate exposure to a documented <em>S. </em>Typhi chronic carrier (eg, household contacts), and for individuals whose work exposes them to cultures or specimens containing <em>S</em>. Typhi (eg, laboratory workers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Either vaccine formulation is appropriate, although the oral vaccine should be avoided in immunocompromised and pregnant individuals since it is a live vaccine. If repeated exposure to <em>S. </em>Typhi<em> </em>is expected, repeat typhoid vaccination is advised to maintain immunity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-travel#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for travel&quot;, section on 'Typhoid vaccine'</a>.)</p><p>In endemic areas, prevention of enteric fever would require implementing immunization for young children. In a study including more than 37,000 children two to five years of age, the parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine was useful for inducing both direct and indirect protection (overall protection was 57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Furthermore, a critical challenge, in addition to the limited efficacy and duration of protection, is that neither available vaccine is indicated for children under two years of age. These attributes make it challenging to incorporate typhoid vaccines into routine immunization programs.</p><p>Vaccination is appropriate even in those who have a history of enteric fever, particularly in those not living in endemic areas, if re-exposure is expected. Natural infection does not provide complete protection against recurrent illness (which is not the same as relapsed infection).

For patients with uncomplicated enteric fever due to an isolate known or suspected to have reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>); <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> is an alternative.
