The term &quot;heart failure&quot; is misleading because the heart does not completely fail or stop. Heart failure can be mild and cause minor symptoms that are only evident with exercise, or it may be severe, leading to symptoms at rest, or even life-threatening. The most common symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath, feeling tired, leg swelling, and other signs of fluid retention.</p><p>Although heart failure is a serious condition, safe and effective treatments are available. Treatment can help you to feel better and live longer.</p><p>This article discusses the most common causes, symptoms, and treatment of heart failure. More detailed information about heart failure is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF HEART FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heart is composed of four chambers: The two upper chambers are the right and left atria, and the two lower chambers are the right and left ventricles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77576 \">figure 1</a>). The left ventricle plays a key role because it pumps blood to the entire body. In a person with heart failure, the heart cannot adjust to the body's changing need for oxygenated blood (for example, when climbing stairs).</p><p>There are two main types of heart failure. They are defined based on whether the &quot;ejection fraction&quot; (which indicates how well the left ventricle is able to pump) is preserved or reduced:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>&quot;heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</strong> (also called &quot;HFrEF&quot; or &quot;systolic heart failure&quot;), the heart is too weak. When the heart pumps, it doesn&rsquo;t squeeze normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>&quot;heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot; </strong>(also called &quot;HFpEF&quot; or &quot;diastolic heart failure&quot;), the heart is too stiff. When the heart pumps, it doesn&rsquo;t relax and fill with blood normally.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART FAILURE CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart failure is caused by a disease or condition that damages the heart. Fortunately, treating these conditions during the early stages can often prevent or slow development of heart failure. The most common causes of heart failure include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">High blood pressure (hypertension)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In people with high blood pressure, the heart must work harder to pump blood. This increased workload can, over time, lead to an enlarged heart that does not work well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary heart disease causes narrowing of the blood vessels that supply (&quot;feed&quot;) the heart muscle, reducing the flow of blood through the vessels. As a result, portions of the heart muscle are deprived of oxygen (especially during exercise, when the body needs more blood supply and oxygen), and the heart does not perform its work as well. Coronary heart disease can also lead to a heart attack (also called a myocardial infarction), which causes permanent damage to the heart muscle. Coronary heart disease can cause heart failure when it impairs the function of the heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart valve disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of conditions, including heart attack and aging, can damage the heart valves.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The valve can become narrowed (stenosed), which interferes with blood flow through the valve and increases pressure in the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In other cases, the valve can become leaky (insufficient), causing blood to flow backward (regurgitation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-regurgitation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Mitral regurgitation (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Some valves become both stenosed and regurgitant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cardiomyopathy, the structure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of the heart muscle is altered, leading to a poorly pumping heart that may exhibit either HFrEF or HFpEF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART FAILURE SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the amount of blood pumped by the heart (the cardiac output) decreases, a variety of symptoms can develop.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness, particularly of the legs when exercising.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lightheadedness or dizziness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath, which might require you to be less active or sleep with several pillows to elevate your head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rapid heart rate, even while resting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the lower legs and feet (edema) or in the abdomen (ascites). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or fatigued quickly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART FAILURE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart failure is diagnosed based upon your medical history, an exam, and a series of tests. These tests can tell your doctor how well your heart is working and can help determine the cause of your heart failure. Tests may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram (EKG) &ndash; An EKG provides a picture of the electrical activity that causes the heart to beat. An EKG may detect conditions, such as an abnormal heart rhythm or a previous heart attack that could cause heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood test known as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP). The BNP or NT-proBNP level is elevated in people with heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest X-ray &ndash; A chest X-ray shows the size and shape of the heart and the large blood vessels in the chest. It also can show if there is fluid in the lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiogram &ndash; An echocardiogram uses ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to assess the size and function of the heart's chambers and the structure and function of the heart valves. This includes measuring how well the left ventricle pumps (known as the &quot;ejection fraction&quot;). A follow-up echocardiogram can be done to see if your heart function changes over time. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise testing &ndash; An exercise test (&quot;stress test&quot;) determines how well your heart performs during exercise. It is one way to look for signs of a shortage of blood supply to your heart caused by blockages in the coronary arteries. A doctor or nurse will see how your heart responds to exercise by looking at the EKG, blood pressure, and heart rate as you walk on a treadmill. In addition, pictures may be taken to measure the effect of exercise on the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart (cardiac) catheterization &ndash; Cardiac catheterization helps to measure how well the heart is functioning and provides pictures of the coronary arteries to look for blockages. During the test, a thin tube (the catheter) is inserted through a large blood vessel in the groin (or arm) and advanced into the heart. A dye is injected into the catheter to view the arteries and the structure of the heart by X-ray. The pumping function of the heart can also be assessed during catheterization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other tests &ndash; Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear scanning are sometimes used to look at the heart muscle and coronary arteries in specific situations.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART FAILURE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart failure can cause symptoms and make you feel ill. It can cause dangerous, even life-threatening complications. Left untreated, heart failure generally is often a progressive condition. The goal of treatments for heart failure is to reduce symptoms, reduce the chance of developing complications, and slow or stop the progression of the underlying process. Some common complications include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irregular heart rhythms (called arrhythmias), which can make symptoms worse or cause blood clots. Some irregular heart rhythms are life threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney disease, which may be caused or worsened by heart failure. Kidney disease may also make heart failure worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver disease, which may be caused by heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART FAILURE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most people, heart failure is a chronic problem, meaning that it continues for months and years. Heart failure is generally treatable but rarely goes away completely. Treatment usually includes a combination of changes in your diet and lifestyle, medicines, and sometimes a device to protect your heart from abnormal rhythms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet and lifestyle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in diet and lifestyle are often recommended to treat heart failure. The most common recommendations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease salt and water &ndash; Salt in the diet can cause the retention of excess fluid in the circulation, lungs, and elsewhere in the body. Therefore, managing the amount of salt (sodium) in the foods you eat can help to keep heart failure under control. Ask your doctor how much salt you should eat. Low-sodium diets are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The amount of fluid you drink is also important. People with <strong>severe</strong> heart failure are often asked to drink less than 2 liters (66 ounces) of fluid per day. This includes all fluids. Your doctor might give you more specific guidance on fluid limits based on your condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weigh yourself every day &ndash; To monitor your fluid levels, weigh yourself every day at the same time on the same scale (eg, in the morning after you urinate but before eating breakfast). Be sure to wear the same amount of clothing each time you weigh yourself. If your weight increases by 2 pounds (1 kilogram) in one day, call your doctor or nurse. Also, if your weight increases by four pounds (2 kg) in one week, call your doctor or nurse. Gaining weight suddenly is one sign that you may be retaining more fluid than you should be.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control your weight &ndash; If you are overweight, your heart must work harder to supply blood and oxygen to your body. Losing weight can help you to feel better and reduces the strain on your heart. On the other hand, losing a lot of weight quickly can be a sign of severe heart failure. For advice on weight management, talk to your doctor or nurse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking &ndash; Cigarette smoking increases your risk of having a heart attack and can worsen heart failure. If you smoke, talk to your doctor or nurse to get help with quitting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit alcohol &ndash; Drinking too much alcohol is not good for your heart or your health generally. People with heart failure should not drink more than one serving of alcohol per day (for women) or two servings per day (for men). One serving is 12 ounces of beer or 5 ounces of wine. If your heart failure is related to drinking too much, you should stop drinking alcohol completely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac rehab and exercise &ndash; Exercising most days of the week can help to improve the fitness of your cardiovascular system and exercising muscles, and thereby reduce shortness of breath and fatigue, which are common problems in people with heart failure. Becoming more active can also help you to feel better. For exercise advice, talk to your doctor or nurse. They might recommend a cardiac rehab program to help you develop a safe exercise plan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-recovery-beyond-the-basics#H5\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart attack recovery (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Cardiac rehabilitation after heart attack'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines are often used to treat heart failure symptoms; some medicines have even been proven to prolong life. It is very important to take these medicines on time every single day. If you cannot afford or have trouble taking your medicines, talk to your doctor or nurse.</p><p>There are some differences in the medications used to treat &quot;heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot; and &quot;heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1044629085\"><span class=\"h3\">Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines commonly prescribed to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diuretic</strong> &ndash; People with heart failure often develop swelling (or edema) in the legs and fluid in the lungs. A diuretic (also called a &quot;water pill&quot;) helps the body get rid of the excess fluid. The dose of diuretic requires careful monitoring and adjustment by your clinician, taking into consideration changes in your diet, underlying condition, or other medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) &ndash; An ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI widens blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, making it easier for your heart to pump. These medicines also protect the heart from hormone effects that can happen when a person has heart failure. ACE inhibitors can sometimes cause a dry cough, in which case an ARB may be preferred. The ARNI sacubitril-valsartan is a newer heart failure medicine that can be used instead of an ACE inhibitor. These medications can help prolong life.<br/><br/>Some examples of ACE inhibitors include enalapril, captopril, and lisinopril (brand name: Zestril). Some examples of ARBs include losartan (brand name: Cozaar) and valsartan (brand name: Diovan). The ARNI sacubitril-valsartan (brand name: Entresto) has two medicines in a single pill. One is the ARB called valsartan; the other is called sacubitril, and can help your body to retain less fluid and relax blood vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta blocker</strong> &ndash; A beta blocker can slow the heart rate and decrease blood pressure. A beta blocker also protects the heart from the adverse effects of certain hormones that are increased when a person has heart failure. It can take time to start working, and some people feel worse right after they start taking it. If your doctor prescribes a beta blocker, give it a little time to start working. This medication can help prolong life.<br/><br/>Some examples of beta blockers include carvedilol (brand name: Coreg), metoprolol (brand name: Toprol XL), and bisoprolol.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><br/>Ivabradine (brand name: Corlanor) is a newer type of drug to slow the heart rate. Your doctor might prescribe ivabradine if your heart rate is still a little fast with a beta blocker, or if you cannot take a beta blocker. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist</strong> &ndash; A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is a type of diuretic; it helps the body get rid of extra salt and fluid. However, it also helps the body hold onto potassium. That's important because other diuretics sometimes make the body lose too much potassium, which the body needs to work normally. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists might also protect the heart from hormone effects that can happen when a person has heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When taking this type of medicine, it is very important to have regular blood tests to check your potassium levels and see how your kidneys are working. Your doctor or nurse should follow the results of these tests closely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some examples of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists include spironolactone (brand name: Aldactone) and eplerenone (brand name: Inspra).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nitrate with hydralazine</strong> &ndash; A nitrate and hydralazine work together to relax and expand blood vessels. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood throughout the body. This combination of medicines is sometimes used in people who cannot take an ACE inhibitor. Unfortunately, the medicines often cause side effects (such as headaches and nausea), so doctors usually try other options before suggesting them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These two medicines come in a single pill, but it is possible to get the two ingredients separately for much less money. The two ingredients come in pills of &quot;isosorbide dinitrate&quot; and &quot;hydralazine.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Digoxin</strong> &ndash; Digoxin helps the heart pump with more force. This can help reduce some of the symptoms of heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1044629094\"><span class=\"h3\">Medicines for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines commonly prescribed to treat heart failure with preserved ejection fraction include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diuretic</strong> &ndash; People with heart failure often develop swelling (or edema) in the legs and fluid in the lungs. A diuretic (also called a &quot;water pill&quot;) helps the body get rid of the excess fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist</strong> &ndash; A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is a type of diuretic; it helps the body get rid of extra salt and fluid. However, it also helps the body hold onto potassium. That's important because other diuretics sometimes make the body lose too much potassium, which the body needs to work normally. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists might also protect the heart from hormone effects that can happen when a person has heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When taking this type of medicine, it is very important to have regular blood tests to check your potassium levels and see how your kidneys are working.

Some abnormal heart rhythms are treated with medications. </p><p>If you have a condition that causes an abnormal heart rhythm, your doctor might recommend a device that shocks the heart and returns it to a normal rhythm. The device is called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). It is implanted under the skin in your upper chest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another potential problem in people with heart failure is abnormal electrical conduction in the heart. This can cause the walls of the left ventricle to contract out of sync, making the heart work less efficiently. A special type of pacemaker, called cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or biventricular pacing, can treat this problem. A device that includes both CRT and ICD is available, if needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pacemakers (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery or stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is sometimes recommended for people with heart failure who also have coronary heart disease or severe disease of the heart valves. This might include heart valve surgery or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or both. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some cases, coronary heart disease can be treated with a coronary artery angioplasty or stent procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stenting-for-the-heart-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Stenting for the heart (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment for advanced heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart transplantation can be helpful for some people with severe heart failure that has not responded to other treatments. However, careful screening is required to ensure that heart transplantation is appropriate. In addition, the supply of hearts for transplant is limited, so most people must wait for months or even years before a heart is available. People who have a heart transplant are followed closely before and after surgery, since there are numerous risks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart transplantation (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Your doctor might recommend a left ventricular assist device instead of transplantation <strong>OR</strong> while you wait for transplantation. These devices are implanted inside the chest and are designed to improve blood flow to the body when the heart pump is weakened. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO CARE FOR YOURSELF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Being diagnosed with heart failure can be frightening. There are a few basic guidelines that can help to manage your condition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always take your medicines.
