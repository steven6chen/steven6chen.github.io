FSGS is characterized by the presence of sclerosis in parts (segmental) of some (focal) glomeruli on light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of minimal change disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;FSGS&quot; is somewhat misleading, however, since the lesions of FSGS are not as focal or segmental in distribution as the name suggests. In experimental models of FSGS, for example, nearly all glomeruli have sclerotic lesions on three-dimensional morphometric analysis, but light microscopic examination reveals only a limited number of glomeruli with segmental sclerotic lesions. Since the average volume of a sclerotic lesion in FSGS is approximately 12.5 percent of the total glomerular volume, evaluation of kidney biopsies by conventional single sections largely underestimates the number of sclerotic glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, precise quantification of sclerotic glomeruli requires three-dimensional morphometric analysis of entire glomeruli and the examination of sufficient glomeruli to ensure that the biopsy specimen is representative of glomeruli in the whole kidney. Kidney biopsies with few glomeruli (ie, fewer than 15) cannot confidently exclude the diagnosis of FSGS, and, due to sampling error, some cases will be misclassified as minimal change disease.</p><p>The lesion of FSGS can be classified into primary, secondary, and genetic forms. Primary FSGS, like minimal change disease, arises as a consequence of multiple pathways causing injury to the podocyte. Secondary FSGS generally occurs as an adaptive phenomenon that results from a reduction in nephron mass, a scar from a healing inflammatory lesion, or direct toxicity from drugs or viral infections. FSGS can also be caused by a number of genetic mutations in genes that code for proteins expressed in podocytes and at the slit diaphragm. The presence of an FSGS lesion in a renal biopsy does not itself establish a diagnosis but should initiate an evaluation to identify a specific etiology, since distinguishing between the different forms of FSGS has important implications for treatment and prognosis. </p><p>The lesion of FSGS must also be distinguished from the lesion of focal global glomerulosclerosis (FGGS), which is frequently a manifestation of normal aging and can be superimposed on a lesion of FSGS, particularly in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of FSGS will be reviewed in this topic. The treatment of both primary FSGS and recurrent disease in the renal transplant are discussed separately.

FSGS is also the most common primary glomerular disease identified in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The prevalence of FSGS as a lesion associated with ESRD has risen. In 1980, FSGS was the cause of ESRD in only 0.2 percent of patients; by 2000, it was responsible for 2.3 percent of cases (excluding patients with HIV), an 11-fold increase. The lifetime risk of ESRD was fourfold higher in black patients compared with white and Asian patients and 1.5- to twofold higher in males compared with females.</p><p>By comparison, FSGS is a less common cause of nephrotic syndrome in other countries. As an example, in a study of 2000 Spanish patients between 15 and 65 years of age with nephrotic syndrome, the most common histologic lesion was membranous nephropathy (24 percent), followed by minimal change disease (16 percent), lupus nephritis (14 percent), and FSGS (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another retrospective analysis of renal biopsies performed among Chinese patients &ge;65 years of age, the most common diagnoses were membranous nephropathy (29 percent), diabetic nephropathy (9.7 percent), IgA nephropathy (9.6 percent), and vasculitis (6.8 percent), with FSGS occurring in &lt;5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can be classified into the following etiologies, based upon the known <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postulated causes of this histologic pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary or idiopathic FSGS, which most often presents with the nephrotic syndrome.

This includes disorders associated with a reduced renal mass <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal vasodilation, such as unilateral renal agenesis. In addition, a nonspecific pattern of secondary FSGS can result from scarring produced by a previous injury (due to a variety of conditions, including active IgA nephropathy, vasculitis, and lupus nephritis). Other secondary causes of FSGS include drugs and toxins (including heroin, interferon, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>) and viral infections (particularly HIV). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of secondary FSGS'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic causes of FSGS, which may present early in childhood with massive proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome or in adolescence or adulthood with less massive proteinuria.

About 50 to 60 percent of patients with primary FSGS respond to immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, while secondary FSGS is best treated with modalities aimed at lowering the intraglomerular pressure, such as angiotensin inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H79962422\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>However, in clinical practice, the distinction between primary and secondary FSGS is not always straightforward, and many patients are misdiagnosed and undergo unnecessary immunosuppressive treatment. </p><p>In contrast with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis or membranous nephropathy, for which ANCA and anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies are available to aid with the diagnosis, there are no serum or urinary biomarkers that can unequivocally distinguish a primary FSGS lesion from secondary FSGS or FSGS due to a genetic mutation. </p><p>In patients who are found to have a FSGS lesion by light microscopy, the following approach can be used to distinguish between those with primary and secondary FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who present with nephrotic syndrome (ie, urine protein excretion &gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and hypoalbuminemia), who exhibit extensive foot process effacement (&ge;80 percent) on electron microscopic (EM) examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79479\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79479 \">picture 1</a>), <strong>and </strong>who have no identifiable risk factors associated with secondary FSGS (eg, viral infection, drugs) most likely have primary FSGS, although genetic forms of FSGS lesions cannot always be excluded with confidence.

Some patients with primary FSGS, such as those with the collapsing variant, may present with heavier proteinuria (eg, &gt;10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span>. Studies evaluating the clinical characteristics of patients with primary FSGS have found that 70 to nearly 95 percent present with nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/14-16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16,20</a>]. Hematuria is common (approximately 50 percent of patients) and hypertension is present in approximately 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/14-16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16,20</a>]. An elevated serum creatinine may be seen in 25 to 50 percent of patients at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/14-16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16,20</a>] but may not necessarily reflect chronic kidney damage since acute tubular necrosis can occur in patients with severe proteinuria.</p><p>In contrast, patients with secondary FSGS typically present with slowly increasing proteinuria and renal insufficiency over time.

Primary FSGS was defined as idiopathic disease (rather than by histologic criteria), while secondary FSGS was thought to result from the presence of massive obesity, vesicoureteral reflux, or renal mass reduction. Only 2 of 18 patients with a normal serum albumin concentration, compared with all with hypoalbuminemia, had primary FSGS. In addition, all patients with, but none without, hypoalbuminemia had peripheral edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61686439\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histologic findings are generally different in primary and secondary FSGS, although there is some overlap. Primary FSGS is associated with diffuse foot process fusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79479\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79479 \">picture 1</a>); by comparison, this abnormality tends to be segmental in the secondary forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25,26</a>]. In a systematic histologic study, the mean percentage of the glomerular surface area affected by foot process fusion was 65 percent in primary FSGS versus 25 percent in FSGS due to reflux nephropathy and 20 percent in obesity-related disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Foot process fusion was greatest (82 to 89 percent) in the most severe form, collapsing FSGS.

With healed vasculitis, the obsolescent segment of the capillary tuft is usually incorporated into scar tissue that is typically composed of collagens type I and III and that may fragment the tuft. On periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, this scar tissue stains significantly less intensely than the strongly PAS-positive segment of collapsed capillary basement membrane material in primary FSGS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4127784072\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary versus genetic FSGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distinguishing familial or genetic FSGS from idiopathic disease can be difficult, and familial disease may account for a significant proportion of patients with glucocorticoid-resistant FSGS, at least in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Genetic disorders can lead to a wide range of clinical disease, ranging from minimal change disease to adult-onset FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Findings suggestive, but not diagnostic, of familial FSGS include a family history of FSGS and disease onset in infancy or early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, a detailed family history is of paramount importance in the evaluation of such patients. </p><p>Glucocorticoid resistance is a consistent finding that also may be seen in primary FSGS. Although glucocorticoid-resistant FSGS is due to familial disease in many children, its predictive value in adults is uncertain. In addition, some adults who have FSGS-associated mutations may respond to glucocorticoid therapy.

Exceptions include the distinctive features associated with <em>NPHS1</em> and alpha-actinin-4 gene mutations and the disease-specific lesions of Fabry disease, Alport syndrome, and lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].

Sclerotic changes occur first in juxtamedullary glomeruli and therefore may be missed in superficial biopsies that only contain cortex. Mild mesangial hypercellularity and partial occlusion of the capillary lumens by hyaline deposits are commonly seen. The latter represent the insudation of plasma proteins into the abnormally permeable glomerular capillary wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>Immunofluorescence microscopy usually reveals no immune deposits, except for what may represent nonspecific binding of IgM and complement (C3 and variably C1) in sclerotic lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59969 \">picture 3</a>).

Given its unique pathology, some investigators feel that this variant should be called collapsing glomerulopathy and <strong>not</strong> be considered a form of FSGS.

However, some patients with collapsing FSGS, despite having massive proteinuria, do not present with edema, which may be due to the rapid loss in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in these patients. Affected patients are frequently resistant to therapy and often have a rapid progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

It is important, clinically, to distinguish secondary from primary FSGS since the treatment of secondary FSGS consists of conservative therapy aimed at a <span class=\"nowrap\">low-protein/low-salt</span> diet and blood pressure control with inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system but not glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive therapy. How this distinction is made is discussed above.

The visceral epithelial cells are unable to replicate. In the presence of the hypertrophic response to nephron loss or direct epithelial cell injury, it is postulated that the inability of these cells to replicate leads to decreased podocyte density and focal areas of denudation from the glomerular basement membrane. As a result, the barrier to filtration normally provided by the slit diaphragms between the foot processes is lost in these areas. The ensuing increase in flux of small solutes and water through these sites carries albumin along by solvent drag [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/26,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,45</a>].

How these changes occur is not well understood, but cytokines, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, may be responsible for at least part of the matrix accumulation. TGF-beta accelerates podocyte damage by changing transcriptional activity to allow for expression of cytosolic cathepsin L [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

The settings in which adaptive glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration occur include the many diseases associated with either nephron loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraglomerular hypertension with an initially normal number of nephrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduced renal mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FSGS induced by the adaptive response to nephron loss occurs with many causes of chronic kidney disease, including nonglomerular disorders such as reflux nephropathy and ischemia in benign hypertensive nephrosclerosis. It can also occur when there is a marked reduction in renal mass due to congenital absence or surgical removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypertensive-nephrosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertensive nephrosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In these settings, compensatory intraglomerular hypertension and hypertrophy in the remaining glomeruli will lead to an increase in the nephron filtration rate that will initially tend to maintain the total GFR. Over a period of years, however, &quot;hypertensive&quot; injury associated with intraglomerular hypertension can lead to FSGS and a decline in GFR. The protective effect of angiotensin inhibitors is mediated in part by the associated reduction in glomerular capillary pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of chronic kidney disease: Experimental studies&quot;, section on 'Preferential effect of ACE inhibitors on renal hemodynamics'</a>.) </p><p>The risk of developing secondary FSGS after nephron loss is dose dependent or there may be a threshold effect, with surgical studies suggesting that loss of more than 50 percent of nephrons is required in adults. This was illustrated in a long-term follow-up of adults undergoing partial nephrectomy for renal cancer in a solitary kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Patients who lost more than 75 percent of their total renal mass were at greatest risk for developing proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and, in some cases, progressive renal failure. Clinically evident disease was usually delayed for at least five years after the surgery.</p><p>By comparison, long-term renal outcomes are generally excellent after loss of one kidney (50 percent nephron loss). As an example, a benign clinical course after 45 years was noted in 62 men who had one kidney removed (ie, 50 percent nephron loss) due to trauma during World War II and in a literature review of 3124 patients with reduced renal mass, almost all of whom had undergone unilateral nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]. There was no evidence that nephrectomy was associated with an increased prevalence of renal dysfunction or hypertension, but there was a small increase in proteinuria and in the systolic blood pressure (2.4 mmHg initially and a further 1.1 mmHg per decade) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Similarly, long-term renal outcomes are generally excellent in kidney donors for renal transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-living-kidney-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of living kidney donation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although loss of 50 percent of renal mass may be associated with a minor, long-term risk when it occurs in adults, unilateral renal agenesis is associated with an increased incidence of secondary FSGS. These patients often have structural disease (most often vesicoureteral reflux or partial urinary tract obstruction) in the solitary kidney, which may result in a greater degree of nephron loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. However, proteinuria and renal insufficiency can occur in patients with an apparently normal solitary kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>], suggesting that loss of 50 percent of renal mass beginning at birth is sufficient to induce hemodynamically mediated glomerular injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal agenesis: Prenatal diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Low birth weight and premature birth, which are associated with reduced renal mass, may be risk factors for the development of FSGS. A retrospective study from Japan reviewed the birth weights and gestational age of all patients who underwent kidney biopsies at a single institution from 1995 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Among 16 patients who were diagnosed with FSGS, six (37.5 percent) had low birth weight, a rate that was significantly higher than the overall low birth weight rate in Japan (9.7 percent). All patients with FSGS and low birth weight also had premature birth (average gestational age 25.8 weeks). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FSGS has been described in patients with severe (also called massive or extreme) obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/21,22,97-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,97-100</a>]. In one study, FSGS was present in 9 of 17 patients with severe obesity who underwent renal biopsy for marked proteinuria without an apparent systemic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The frequency of FSGS was much higher than in 34 normal body weight controls matched for age and sex with a similar renal presentation (53 versus 6 percent). Most patients also have glomerulomegaly, but some patients (14 of 71 [20 percent] in one series) have glomerulomegaly without evidence of glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;obesity-related glomerulopathy&quot; has been used to refer to FSGS associated with obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/21,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,101</a>]. However, some obese patients with moderate to heavy proteinuria have little or no glomerulosclerosis and no epithelial cell injury or foot process fusion on renal biopsy; they do have significant mesangial expansion and glomerular capillary loop enlargement (glomerulomegaly) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/21,101-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,101-104</a>]. Renal biopsy findings suggestive of obesity-related glomerulopathy include fewer glomeruli showing an FSGS lesion (12 versus 39 percent in primary FSGS), a perihilar variant, glomerulomegaly, and &lt;50 percent foot process effacement by electron microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>Severe obesity in humans is associated with a marked increase in GFR. In one study, for example, the mean GFR in eight severely obese patients was 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> compared with 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in nine healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. After marked weight loss in the obese patients (32 percent reduction in body mass index [BMI]), the mean GFR fell to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. These findings are consistent with a role for intraglomerular hypertension in the pathogenesis of the proteinuria and sclerotic lesions in obesity-related FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/21,97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,97-99</a>]. Decreased serum levels of an adipose-derived hormone, adiponectin, have been associated with proteinuria in obese patients and may play a pathogenetic role in the development of glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p>Some patients with severe obesity have <strong>subclinical</strong> disease, which is defined as sclerotic lesions in a few glomeruli in patients with little or mild proteinuria and a normal GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/21,97,107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,97,107,108</a>]. The best data come from a series of 95 patients with severe obesity and no clinical evidence of renal disease in whom intraoperative renal biopsy was performed during bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Forty patients undergoing nephrectomy who were neither obese nor hypertensive served as controls. FSGS was observed in approximately 5 percent of the obese patients compared with none of the nonobese patients (median BMI 52 versus 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>. Increased mesangial matrix, mesangial cell proliferation, and podocyte hypertrophy occurred in 73 and 5 percent of obese and nonobese patients, respectively. BMI was independently associated with these glomerular lesions in the entire cohort. It is not known if these observations would also apply to the moderately obese population (BMI = 30 to 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>.</p><p>In some reports, obesity-related glomerulopathy has been attributed to coexistent sleep apnea, with its reversal leading to complete resolution of the proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/102,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,109</a>]. However, a subsequent, well-designed study of patients with varying degrees of sleep apnea found no correlation between proteinuria and the presence or severity of the sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Although the reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear, previous reports failed to exclude possible confounding factors, particularly decompensated heart failure. In the biopsy study cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>], sleep apnea was associated with glomerulomegaly (in the absence of proteinuria) in the extremely obese cohort. </p><p>Both weight loss and the administration of an angiotensin inhibitor can dramatically reduce protein excretion (up to 80 to 85 percent) in patients with obesity-related FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/98,105,111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,105,111,112</a>]. The efficacy of weight loss was demonstrated in a study of 63 patients with biopsy-proven FSGS who participated in a weight loss program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. Mean protein excretion was 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and mean baseline estimated GFR was 104 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. At six months, mean protein excretion decreased from 1.6 to 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in the 27 patients who lost weight in comparison with no reduction in proteinuria in patients who had a stable (n = 21) or increased (n = 8) body mass index. The findings were similar at 24 months.</p><p>In spite of the slowly progressive course of obesity-related FSGS, worsening renal impairment and ESRD may develop in 10 to 33 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/21,22,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,113</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2229495266\"><span class=\"h3\">Other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Segmental areas of glomerulosclerosis can be induced by intraglomerular hypertension occurring in patients with initially normal renal mass, such as those with the following conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic nephropathy.

The majority of the genetic causes of FSGS follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and manifest in the first year of life, with mutations in the genes for nephrin (<em>NPHS1</em>) and podocin (<em>NPHS2</em>) being the most common. Autosomal dominant forms (eg, mutations in the genes for alpha-actinin-4 or TRPC6) more frequently present during adolescence or later in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/143,144\" class=\"abstract_t\">143,144</a>].</p><p>The decision to obtain genetic testing in a patient presenting with FSGS should be based upon the age of the patient at the time of disease onset and whether a family history of renal disease is present.

As an example, the decline in renal function attributed to <em>APOL1 </em>risk variants has been shown to be dependent upon plasma levels of the soluble urokinase plasminogen activating receptor (suPAR). In a study involving two independent cohorts of African-American individuals (1094 patients), higher baseline suPAR levels were associated with a greater annual decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among patients with two <em>APOL1 </em>risk alleles compared with those with one or no alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>]. This association may be explained by high-affinity protein-protein interactions between suPAR, APOL1, and alphavbeta3 integrin, whereby the APOL1 protein variants G1 and G2 exhibit higher affinity for suPAR-activated alphavbeta3 integrin than APOL1 G0. In addition, APOL1 G1 or G2 augment alphavbeta3 integrin activation and cause proteinuria in mice in a suPAR-dependent manner. (See <a href=\"#H2976322833\" class=\"local\">'suPAR'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1230754994\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histologic lesion, rather than a specific disease entity, that is commonly found to underlie the nephrotic syndrome in adults and children. FSGS is characterized by the presence of sclerosis in parts (segmental) of some (focal) glomeruli on light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen. The term &quot;FSGS&quot; is somewhat misleading, however, since the lesions of FSGS are not as focal or segmental in distribution as the name suggests. The lesion of FSGS must also be distinguished from the lesion of focal global glomerulosclerosis, which is frequently a manifestation of normal aging and can be superimposed on a lesion of FSGS, particularly in older patients. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FSGS is a common histopathologic lesion among adults with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in the United States, accounting for 35 percent of all cases and over 50 percent among African Americans. By comparison, FSGS is a less common cause of nephrotic syndrome in other countries. (See <a href=\"#H5530119\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FSGS can be classified into the following etiologies, based upon the known <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postulated causes of this histologic pattern (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary or idiopathic FSGS, which most often presents with the nephrotic syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Secondary FSGS, which most often presents with non-nephrotic proteinuria and, commonly, some degree of renal insufficiency. This category most commonly refers to FSGS that develops as an adaptive response to glomerular hypertrophy or hyperfiltration. This includes disorders associated with a reduced renal mass <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal vasodilation, such as unilateral renal agenesis. In addition, a nonspecific pattern of secondary FSGS can result from scarring produced by a previous injury. Other secondary causes of FSGS include drugs and toxins (including heroin, interferon, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>) and viral infections (particularly HIV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genetic causes of FSGS, which may present early in childhood with massive proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome or in adolescence or adulthood with less massive proteinuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are found to have a FSGS lesion by light microscopy, the following approach can be used to distinguish between those with primary and secondary FSGS (see <a href=\"#H1979803939\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary FSGS'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who present with nephrotic syndrome (ie, urine protein excretion &gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and hypoalbuminemia), who exhibit extensive foot process effacement (&ge;80 percent) on electron microscopic (EM) examination, <strong>and </strong>who have no identifiable risk factors associated with secondary FSGS (eg, viral infection, drugs) most likely have primary FSGS, although genetic forms of FSGS lesions cannot always be excluded with confidence. Thus, primary FSGS is always a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who present with subnephrotic (ie, &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in adults) or nephrotic-range proteinuria and a normal serum albumin concentration (ie, without nephrotic syndrome) <strong>and</strong> segmental foot process effacement (&lt;80 percent) on EM examination most likely have secondary FSGS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Columbia classification has defined five morphologic variants of the lesion of FSGS based upon light microscopy examination. The prognostic and therapeutic decision-making value of these histologic variants is unclear (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Histologic variants'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>FSGS <strong>n</strong>ot <strong>o</strong>therwise <strong>s</strong>pecified (NOS), formerly called classic FSGS, is the most common form. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'FSGS not otherwise specified (NOS)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Collapsing variant, although some argue that this should be considered a separate entity rather than a variant of FSGS. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Collapsing variant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tip variant. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Tip variant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perihilar variant. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Perihilar variant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cellular variant. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Perihilar variant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the majority of patients with primary FSGS, injury to glomerular visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) occurs likely as a consequence of a circulating permeability factor or factors, the identity of which has not yet been clearly established. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of primary FSGS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The glomerulosclerosis of secondary FSGS usually results from an adaptive response to glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration, from scarring due to previous injury (eg, healed lesions of lupus nephritis or vasculitis) or other glomerular abnormality (such as those involving the glomerular basement membrane), or from direct toxic injury to podocytes. However, in a substantial (&gt;50 percent) number of patients with clinical and histopathological features suggestive of secondary FSGS, a specific etiology cannot be identified with the diagnostic tools available in clinical practice. It is possible that many of these patients have undiagnosed genetic forms of FSGS, and genetic analysis, which may include next-generation sequencing, should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of secondary FSGS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of genetic forms of FSGS have been described and may account for a significant proportion of patients with glucocorticoid-resistant disease. In general, the genes involved encode for proteins that are integral for proper glomerular basement membrane formation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glomerular podocyte differentiation and function. The majority of the genetic causes of FSGS follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and manifest in the first year of life, with mutations in the genes for nephrin (<em>NPHS1</em>) and podocin (<em>NPHS2</em>) being the most common. Autosomal dominant forms (eg, mutations in the genes for alpha-actinin-4 or TRPC6) more frequently present during adolescence or later in adulthood. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Genetic causes of FSGS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to obtain genetic testing in a patient presenting with FSGS should be based upon the age of the patient at the time of disease onset and whether a family history of renal disease is present. In general, genetic testing should be obtained in the following patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pediatric patients with a documented FSGS lesion and nephrotic syndrome or progressive chronic kidney disease that is resistant to conventional immunosuppression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adult and pediatric patients with a documented FSGS lesion and a family history of kidney disease (especially nephrotic syndrome). The pattern of inheritance (eg, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, matrilineal) may help to guide genetic testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a documented FSGS lesion and a syndromic presentation (eg, skin lesions, deafness, neurologic abnormalities, ocular abnormalities, maturity onset diabetes of the young, hepatosplenomegaly, metabolic acidosis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Routine genetic testing is <strong>not </strong>recommended in adult patients with FSGS who do not have a family history of kidney disease or who do not have clinical evidence of a genetic syndrome. In such patients, the cause of FSGS is rarely attributed to a specific mutation. The increasing availability of genetic analysis at lower cost, which may soon include next-generation sequencing, may change this approach in the near future. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Genetic causes of FSGS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased susceptibility of black patients to FSGS may be explained, at least in part, by genetic factors, although socioeconomic and environmental factors may also play a role. Variants in the apolipoprotein L1 (<em>APOL1</em>) gene have been shown to be closely associated with nondiabetic nephropathy in African Americans. Polymorphisms in <em>APOL1</em> appear to be expressed exclusively in individuals of African descent and have not been identified in any individuals from Europe, Japan, or China. (See <a href=\"#H2383433\" class=\"local\">'APOL1'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Haas M, Meehan SM, Karrison TG, Spargo BH.
