Large gene deletions or nonsense mutations (eg, premature stop codons) are more likely to cause complete absence of the coagulation factor protein, whereas missense mutations, which create amino acid substitutions, may have variable effects on protein function and stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders/abstract/3,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-9</a>].</p><p>By convention, defects that reduce the plasma level of a factor are referred to as type I deficiencies (quantitative deficiency), and those that alter protein function without reducing protein abundance are referred to as type II deficiencies (qualitative deficiency). The distinction between type I and type II generally does not affect management, but it may impact diagnostic testing in rare cases where an immunoassay reveals normal levels of the protein, and a functional assay is required to demonstrate that the protein is dysfunctional. This concern is diminishing due to the increasing use of functional assays.</p><p>Numerous mutations have been reported, and many mutations are unique to a single kindred.

An exception is factor VII deficiency, for which bleeding symptoms correlate less well with factor activity levels (see <a href=\"#H4351108\" class=\"local\">'Factor VII deficiency (F7D)'</a> below). Other genetic changes may also modify bleeding severity (eg, coinheritance of a thrombophilic mutation such as factor V Leiden may reduce bleeding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Bleeding severity may be graded for the purposes of clinical trials or initiating therapy, although clinical judgment is required to determine if bleeding is clinically important for each patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

There is no benefit combining the two antifibrinolytic agents.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TXA can be administered orally or intravenously. A typical dose is 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 1 to 1.5 grams every 8 to 12 hours, intravenously or orally, for the duration of bleeding. Intravenous doses are less well characterized; doses of 10 to 20 mg per kg as an intravenous bolus followed by 10 mg per kg intravenously every six to eight hours have been used in patients with major bleeding, hemophilic bleeding, or after major trauma. TXA excretion is highly dependent on renal function; the interval between doses is substantively increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Nausea and diarrhea are the most common adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EACA can be administered orally or intravenously.

These rare inherited coagulation disorders (RICDs) have a prevalence of 1 in 500,000 to 1 in 2,000,000; they are found more frequently in populations with a high degree of consanguinity. Additional rare autosomal dominant mutations (eg, in factor V or thrombomodulin) have also been reported. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Inheritance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12230410\" class=\"local\">'Genetic defects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6163682\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predominant manifestation of RICDs is bleeding, which may occur with umbilical cord separation, trauma and invasive procedures, or postpartum, or as menorrhagia, muscle and joint bleeding, or epistaxis. The age of bleeding onset is typically in childhood, but onset and severity can vary substantially. Bleeding can also be seen in heterozygotes, especially with greater hemostatic challenges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51595\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51595 \">table 1</a>). Other findings seen with some of the RICDs include impaired wound healing (factor XIII), early pregnancy loss (factor XIII, X) and thrombosis (factor VII, V). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a more severe deficiency (eg, factor activity level &lt;20 percent) may have prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), or both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79969 \">table 3</a>), depending on the position of the factor in the coagulation cascade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998 \">figure 2</a>). In contrast, factor XIII deficiency does not prolong the PT or aPTT. (See <a href=\"#H12035170\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients suspected to have an RICD should have a complete history of hemostatic challenges and bleeding manifestations. Ethnic background and the possibility of consanguineous marriage may also be relevant. Screening tests of hemostasis and measurement of factor activity levels are done in the appropriate clinical setting. In those with a known family history, preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be possible. Neonates are tested after birth, and invasive procedures are delayed until diagnosis is established. Genetic testing is appropriate for some individuals. Diagnosis is established in those with deficient factor activity (typically, &le;50 percent activity) not caused by an inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H906051\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy for acute bleeding (or an invasive procedure) depends on bleeding severity and available factor replacement products. Early input from the consulting specialist is important. (See <a href=\"#H905272\" class=\"local\">'General aspects of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The mainstay of therapy for severe bleeding is factor replacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F98393\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98393 \">table 4</a>) as rapidly as possible. Several types of replacement products are available; access to these products varies by institution. Options in order of preference include recombinant or plasma-derived factor concentrate, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) if it contains the deficient factor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94210 \">table 5</a>), and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP; <span class=\"nowrap\">solvent/detergent</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">[S/D]</span> treated if available). (See <a href=\"#H6166148\" class=\"local\">'Acute bleeding'</a> above and <a href=\"#H908033\" class=\"local\">'Invasive procedure/surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antifibrinolytic agents may be used in conjunction with factor replacement for severe bleeding or alone for less severe bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H221555\" class=\"local\">'Menorrhagia and pregnancy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12230104\" class=\"local\">'Antifibrinolytic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor XIII deficiency is associated with a risk of severe bleeding and early pregnancy loss. For factor XIII deficient patients with frequent bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a factor activity level &le;5 percent, we recommend regular (monthly) prophylactic therapy with recombinant factor XIII A subunit or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-xiii-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">factor XIII concentrate</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Individuals with B subunit deficiency (which is extremely rare) should receive the plasma-derived concentrate. For patients who do not have access to recombinant factor XIII or a plasma-derived concentrate, alternatives include FFP <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/D</span> treated if available) or cryoprecipitate. More intensive dosing may be used during attempted conception and early pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H4349864\" class=\"local\">'Factor XIII deficiency (F13D)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine management of other RICDs depends on factor activity levels and bleeding symptoms, ideally with input from a hemophilia treatment center. (See <a href=\"#H4350607\" class=\"local\">'Factor X deficiency (F10D)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4351108\" class=\"local\">'Factor VII deficiency (F7D)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Factor V deficiency (F5D)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Factor V and VIII combined deficiency (F5F8D)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4351691\" class=\"local\">'Factor II (prothrombin) deficiency (F2D)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Multiple vitamin K-dependent factor deficiencies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional interventions may include treatment of iron deficiency, patient education, and reproductive counseling. Appropriate vaccinations should not be withheld. (See <a href=\"#H7028220\" class=\"local\">'Anemia/iron deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7028408\" class=\"local\">'Education and counseling'</a> above and <a href=\"#H216806\" class=\"local\">'Vaccinations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of informative resources on the RICDs are available to clinicians.
