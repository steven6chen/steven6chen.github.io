Correction of the acidosis may have a variety of benefits, including restoration of normal growth in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], diminished renal potassium wasting and hypokalemia in distal RTA, stabilization or reversal of nephrocalcinosis, reduced frequency of calcium kidney stones, and possibly less osteoporosis in distal RTA and less rickets or osteomalacia in proximal RTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Adequately treated patients are generally asymptomatic and able to lead a normal life, unless irreversible renal or bone disease has occurred prior to therapy. </p><p>The treatment of distal and proximal RTA will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, etiology, and diagnosis of these disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-pathophysiology-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-and-the-effect-on-potassium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis and the effect on potassium balance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of distal (type 1) and proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTAL (TYPE 1) RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults ingesting a typical American or Western European diet generate approximately 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/kg</span> of acid per day that is excreted by the kidneys in the form of titratable acids or ammonium. Patients with distal renal tubular acidosis (distal RTA) have a reduction in ammonium excretion and are unable to maximally lower the urine pH, resulting in the excretion of only part of the daily acid load. Thus, the daily alkali requirement is equal to the amount of hydrogen retained each day plus any urinary bicarbonate losses obligated by the high urine pH. The small amount of urine bicarbonate loss in patients with distal RTA is obligated by the relationship expressed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. It does not represent a defect in bicarbonate reabsorption as in proximal RTA. If, for example, the urine pH is 6.4, the urine bicarbonate concentration will be approximately one-tenth (one log unit) that of the plasma or about 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (assuming similar carbon dioxide tensions).</p><p>Correction of the metabolic acidosis has a number of beneficial effects. It restores normal growth rates in children, minimizes kidney stone formation and nephrocalcinosis, and diminishes calcium losses associated with bone buffering of some of the retained acid, thereby decreasing the risk of osteopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrolithiasis in renal tubular acidosis&quot;, section on 'Distal (type 1) RTA'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, correction of the metabolic acidosis with alkali therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> or sodium citrate) reduces inappropriate urinary potassium losses, which often corrects the associated hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/1,3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-7</a>]. Potassium depletion in these patients results from a reduction in proximal sodium reabsorption induced by metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The subsequent increase in sodium excretion leads to volume contraction and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The combination of increased distal sodium delivery and aldosterone increases renal potassium excretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-pathophysiology-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-and-the-effect-on-potassium-balance#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis and the effect on potassium balance&quot;, section on 'Decreased net activity of the proton pump'</a>.) </p><p>The aim of alkali therapy is to achieve a relatively normal serum bicarbonate concentration (22 to 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span>. Bicarbonate wasting is usually negligible in adults with distal RTA. Thus, adults can generally be treated with 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> or sodium citrate (ie, Bicitra, which may be better tolerated by many patients than sodium bicarbonate). </p><p>By contrast, children may require as much as 4 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/kg</span> per day in divided doses for at least two reasons. First, they often have a higher fixed urine pH, which results in larger bicarbonate losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Second, the rapidly growing skeleton of children and adolescents generates an additional acid load.</p><p>Potassium citrate, alone or combined with sodium citrate (Polycitra), is indicated when hypokalemia persists despite correction of the serum bicarbonate. Potassium citrate alone may also be more effective in some patients with hypercalciuria and persistently active calcium stone disease, primarily due to its effectiveness in correcting intracellular acidosis. In the setting of systemic acidosis, proximal citrate reabsorption is increased. The decrease in urinary citrate, along with skeletal loss of calcium into a persistently alkaline urine, accounts for the increased risk of calcium phosphate stones and, in some patients, nephrocalcinosis. Reducing the degree of acidosis decreases proximal citrate reabsorption, which increases downstream delivery of citrate. Urinary citrate acts to inhibit the crystallization of calcium salts. Sodium citrate, or any sodium salt, may increase calcium excretion and worsen stone disease. The reasons why this occurs are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Limit sodium intake'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diuretics-and-calcium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diuretics and calcium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with distal RTA may occasionally present with paralysis and may progress to respiratory failure as a result of hypokalemia. In this setting, treatment should be focused on correction of the potassium deficit and not the metabolic acidosis. In these life-threatening situations, intravenous potassium should be administered in a solution devoid of glucose and bicarbonate. The rationale is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Potassium salts should <strong>not</strong> be used in patients with hyperkalemic forms of distal RTA, which are generally characterized by diminished sodium reabsorption in the cortical collecting tubule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-pathophysiology-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-and-the-effect-on-potassium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis and the effect on potassium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PROXIMAL (TYPE 2) RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Correction of the acidemia in patients with proximal renal tubular acidosis (proximal RTA) will improve skeletal growth in children and promote healing of rickets or osteomalacia, if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/2,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,6</a>]. Hypophosphatemia due to decreased proximal phosphate reabsorption and reduced activation of vitamin D also occurs in some patients and may be a major contributor to the development of bone disease. Thus, both phosphate and vitamin D supplementation may be necessary to normalize the serum phosphate concentration and reverse the metabolic bone disease.</p><p>Treatment of the metabolic acidosis is more difficult in proximal RTA than in distal RTA because raising the serum bicarbonate concentration will increase the filtered bicarbonate load above the proximal tubule's reduced reabsorptive capacity, resulting in a marked bicarbonate diuresis. Thus, in contrast to the 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/kg</span> per day of alkali therapy required for treatment of distal RTA, 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/kg</span> per day of alkali may be required in patients with proximal RTA to stay ahead of urinary bicarbonate losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The bicarbonaturia induced by alkali therapy also increases urinary potassium losses because increased sodium and water delivery to the distal tubule, as well as the delivery of negatively charged bicarbonate ions, stimulate potassium secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As a result, an empirically determined fraction of the alkali replacement must be given as a potassium salt (usually potassium citrate).</p><p>The addition of a thiazide diuretic may be beneficial if large doses of alkali are ineffective or not well tolerated. The mild volume depletion induced by the diuretic may reduce bicarbonate loss by enhancing the proximal reabsorption of sodium and, secondarily, that of bicarbonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Serial monitoring is required. This is particularly true in children because rapid growth can lead to substantial changes in alkali requirement. Furthermore, proximal RTA is transient in some children, in contrast to most childhood forms of distal RTA, which are usually permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220343844\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
