In most circumstances, emergency clinicians use rapid sequence intubation (RSI) when active airway management is required. RSI incorporates neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) and rapidly acting sedative (ie, induction) medications to create optimal intubating conditions.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the basic clinical pharmacology and selection of NMBAs for use in RSI outside the operating room. The practice of RSI and other medications used as part of RSI are discussed elsewhere, as are other aspects of airway management both inside and outside the operating room.

RSI involves the use of a sedative and a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) to render a patient rapidly unconscious and flaccid in order to facilitate emergent endotracheal intubation, mitigate unwanted physiologic responses to laryngoscopy and intubation, and minimize the risk of aspiration. Multiple prospective observational studies confirm the excellent success rate of RSI using the combination of a sedative and a NMBA in the emergency department (ED) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Multiple randomized trials and observational studies demonstrate that the use of NMBAs improves success rates for emergency endotracheal intubation and reduces the risk of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/1,5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-10</a>]. One prospective trial performed in a prehospital air medical setting and using a crossover design found the use of NMBAs improved the view of the larynx by a full grade in most patients when performing direct laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In RSI, a NMBA is given in conjunction with a sedative agent. Patients undergoing RSI may be fully aware of their environment and painful stimuli, but unable to respond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. If such patients are not adequately sedated, potentially adverse physiologic responses to airway manipulation can occur, including tachycardia, hypertension, and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Sedative use prevents or minimizes these effects, and may also improve the laryngoscopic view obtained after neuromuscular paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Predicted airway difficulty may require modification of the intubation sequence, or avoidance of a NMBA altogether. Prediction and management of the difficult airway is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical circumstance may necessitate the use of a NMBA in a patient despite anticipation of a difficult airway. In such patients, the practitioner must anticipate a possible failure to visualize the glottis and pass an endotracheal tube. If the patient cannot be adequately oxygenated with a bag and mask or extraglottic airway device, decompensation can occur, requiring the placement of a surgical airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neurologic evaluation becomes more difficult after the use of NMBAs for RSI. However, pupillary response appears to be preserved in most such patients, according to a prospective study of 94 patients who received either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a> as part of RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) are classified by their mechanism of action (ie, depolarizing or nondepolarizing). The only depolarizing agent in common clinical use is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Succinylcholine</a> (SCh), the classic depolarizing agent, is an analogue of acetylcholine (ACh) that stimulates all cholinergic receptors throughout the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. SCh binds directly to the postsynaptic ACh receptors of the motor endplate, causing continuous stimulation of these receptors. This leads to transient fasciculations followed by muscular paralysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Only a small percentage of SCh reaches the motor endplate. Most SCh is rapidly hydrolyzed in the bloodstream by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase. Paralysis persists until enough SCh dissociates from the ACh receptor and is hydrolyzed by pseudocholinesterase to allow normal receptor and motor endplate function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondepolarizing agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>) competitively inhibit the postsynaptic ACh receptors of the neuromuscular motor endplate. This action prevents depolarization and inhibits all muscular function. Nondepolarizing NMBAs do not cause membrane depolarization, so the side effects seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> do not occur. The time to clinical effect and the duration of action are uniformly longer than SCh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two categories of nondepolarizing NMBAs exist: the benzylisoquinolinium agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atracurium</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mivacurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mivacurium</a>) and the aminosteroid agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pancuronium</a>). The benzylisoquinolinium agents are not routinely used in the emergency setting because they more often cause histamine release and some cause autonomic ganglionic blockade. The aminosteroids are generally used in RSI when a contraindication to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> (SCh) exists and for prolonged neuromuscular paralysis after intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

For rapid sequence intubation (RSI), SCh is given as a 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenous dose, with intubation-level paralysis occurring 45 to 60 seconds after dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In clinical use, there likely is little difference between the agents, except for the substantially longer duration of action of rocuronium.</p><p>It is far better to overestimate the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> than to underdose. Larger doses result in the same level of paralysis and do not increase the risk to the patient; inadequate doses can leave the patient inadequately paralyzed and difficult to intubate. Dosing of SCh is based on total body weight. This holds true in both morbidly obese and pregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Malignant hyperthermia is a myopathic metabolic disorder that is characterized by sympathetic hyperactivity, muscular rigidity, acidosis, and hyperthermia. Onset is usually acute, but delayed presentations can occur. The cause is thought to be related to abnormal intracellular calcium regulator proteins which result in abnormally high intracellular calcium levels. The disorder is estimated to occur in 0.0004 to 0.00625 percent of patients who receive SCh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Some conditions (eg, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) result in lifelong receptor upregulation.

We believe that either a depolarizing or non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) may be used for patients with MG requiring rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Overall, the pathophysiology of MG (described below) argues for a modest increase in the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> for these patients, and a reduction of dose when a competitive non-depolarizing NMBA is used. If succinylcholine is used, we suggest increasing the intubating dose to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV from our usual recommended dose of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV. If a non-depolarizing NMBA is used, we suggest giving a smaller dose than is typically used for RSI. For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>, we suggest a dose of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, compared with the 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose used for RSI in patients without MG. For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a>, we suggest a dose of 0.06 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> compared with the standard dose of 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. In addition, the priming dose used when giving vecuronium should <strong>not</strong> be given to patients with MG. The rationale for the approach outlined here is described below.</p><p>The pathophysiology of MG includes antibodies to either the acetylcholine (Ach) receptors on the neuromuscular endplate of skeletal muscles or, less frequently, antibodies to specific proteins involved in skeletal muscle contraction. Most myasthenic patients have fewer working Ach receptors, as antibodies destroy the majority of receptors produced. The Ach receptors at the endplate are also dysfunctional, and more Ach is required at the receptor to depolarize muscle than in non-myasthenic patients. In addition, the treatment of MG includes cholinesterase inhibitors, which prolong the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Any strategy for RSI in patients with MG must account for the reduced numbers and dysfunction of Ach receptors, and the effect of treatments. A detailed description of the pathophysiology of MG is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When used for intubation during routine induction of general anesthesia, the depolarizing agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> must be given in higher than usual doses to cause adequate depolarization and muscle relaxation in patients with MG. Dose-response studies in patients with MG show that the average dose of succinylcholine required to cause paralysis in the operating room is approximately three times greater than that required for standard general anesthesia, and the authors recommend higher doses<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/22,68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,68-71</a>]. The typical dose of succinylcholine in the operating room is 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Therefore, when emergency RSI is performed on a patient with MG, the succinylcholine dose should be increased to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Patients with MG do not experience exaggerated potassium elevations when given succinylcholine, unlike patients with established neurologic conditions involving denervation of the motor end plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Non-depolarizing agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a>) act by competitively blocking Ach receptors, thereby reducing the endplate stimulation that maintains muscle tone. Dose-response studies using these agents show that the average dose required to cause train-of-four paralysis in the operating room is less than one-third that required for standard anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/71-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-77</a>]. However, the rocuronium dose used for RSI (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> is nearly twice that used in the operating room (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>. Therefore, a smaller than usual intubating dose of a non-depolarizing NMBA, such as rocuronium, is appropriate when performing RSI in patients with myasthenia gravis. Although the evidence available to guide dosing for RSI is limited and indirect, we believe that a rocuronium dose of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> balances concerns about the prolonged effect that may result from higher doses and the risk of inadequate paralysis and compromised intubating conditions that may result from lower doses.</p><p>Some argue that an NMBA is unnecessary when intubating a patient with a myasthenic crisis, as the typical reason a myasthenic patient requires intubation is muscular weakness and fatigue causing respiratory failure. In addition, NMBA duration of action can be prolonged in myasthenic patients who are therefore at risk for requiring extended mechanical ventilation after being given an NMBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Although some patients with MG may be sufficiently weak that intubation may be successful using a sedative agent alone, we believe this approach may be hazardous and that an NMBA should be used in all cases for which RSI is the selected method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/66,80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,80-82</a>]. The combination of an NMBA and a sedative ensures optimal intubating conditions, while use of a sedative agent alone for emergency intubation of a myasthenic patient risks inadequate muscle relaxation, allowing the patient to clench their jaw, develop laryngospasm, or vomit when intubation is attempted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79122095\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION OF NMBA FOR RSI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intravenous (IV) route is strongly preferred for all medications used during rapid sequence intubation (RSI). When IV access is not possible, administration through an intraosseous line is a reasonable alternative. On rare occasions, it may be necessary to intubate a patient for whom neither IV nor intraosseous access is possible.</p><p>In the rare circumstance when RSI is deemed necessary and medications must be given by intramuscular (IM) injection, we suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>, 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IM, along with an induction agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IM or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> 0.1 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IM). The slower onset of effect for the neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) may result in a longer period of respiratory inadequacy before sufficient relaxation is obtained for intubation. Therefore, the clinician must ensure full pre-oxygenation if possible and provide continuous oxygen by nasal cannula at a rate of at least 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> throughout the procedure. In addition, the clinician should be prepared to supplement the patient's oxygenation with a bag mask device if desaturation occurs before the patient is fully paralyzed for the intubation attempt.</p><p>Studies of IM administration of NMBAs are limited. A systematic review identified nine studies involving 303 adult and pediatric patients that evaluated the onset of effect for NMBAs given by an IM route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].
