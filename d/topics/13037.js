What is known is that some patients who chronically abuse alcohol develop liver disease, primarily because the liver metabolizes the majority of ingested ethanol. Furthermore, the metabolism of ethanol is required for hepatic injury to occur, although variations in ethanol metabolism do not completely explain the variable susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease.</p><p>This topic review will focus on three issues related to the development of alcoholic liver disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The basic aspects of alcohol metabolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanisms that may be responsible for the development of hepatic disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The factors that determine the frequency with which alcohol abuse leads to liver disease</p><p/><p>The different pathologic types of alcoholic liver disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ALCOHOL METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ethanol is metabolized via several pathways, each of which can contribute to toxicity. The primary hepatic pathway generates acetaldehyde and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61009\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61009 \">figure 1</a>). In addition, accessory inducible microsomal pathways may be responsible for the generation of toxic metabolites from several drugs, while a possible role for gastric ethanol metabolism remains controversial.</p><p>Ethanol is metabolized first in the liver to acetaldehyde; this process occurs in the hepatocyte cytosol via a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are multiple forms of the dimeric ADH molecule, each comprised of different combinations of subunits encoded by separate gene loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Polymorphisms of ADH do not predict the susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease but could explain variations in blood alcohol levels among individuals ingesting the same amount of ethanol.</p><p>The acetaldehyde that is generated is subsequently metabolized to acetate, a process that occurs in the mitochondria and is catalyzed by a different enzyme, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). This enzyme, like ADH, has multiple isoforms with differing activities. Genetic variability in ALDH accounts for the well described flushing reaction among 75 percent of Asians who drink alcohol; this reaction resembles the response to alcohol in patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disulfiram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disulfiram</a> (Antabuse).</p><p>The flushing reaction in Asians is due to relative deficiency of ALDH2 isozyme, which results in the accumulation of acetaldehyde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although acetaldehyde may be a potential accelerant to liver injury, this risk is generally offset by an aversion to further alcohol intake induced by flushing. As an example, the rate of alcoholism among Chinese subjects with this genotype is much lower than in other Chinese subjects; however, a separate reduced genetic risk of alcoholism in this subpopulation cannot be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTRIC METABOLISM OF ALCOHOL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stomach has sufficient ADH activity to metabolize a significant amount of ingested alcohol. A study in 1990 aroused great interest by demonstrating that the metabolism of ingested ethanol in the stomach by gastric ADH was lower in women than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This was associated with increased levels of ethanol reaching the liver via the portal vein in women. This observation provides a potential explanation for why women seem to have an increased risk of liver injury, compared to men, for a given amount of chronic ethanol consumption. Infection with Helicobacter pylori and gastritis are other factors that can reduce the activity of gastric ADH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF ALCOHOLIC LIVER INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strongest evidence for alcohol as a cause of liver disease comes from epidemiologic data, not biochemical or clinical studies. As an example, a marked reduction in the number of liver-related deaths was documented in the period after prohibition began in 1916 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other data suggest that risk of alcoholic liver disease is related to the amount and duration of alcohol abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ALCOHOLIC STEATOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors contribute to the development of alcoholic fatty liver including reduced oxidation of hepatic fatty acids and increased lipogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The altered redox state in the liver induced by alcohol impairs beta-oxidation and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Chronic ethanol consumption also increases expression of key lipogenic enzyme regulators, such as sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) and SREBP-1 target genes, such as fatty acid synthase, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, and steroyl-CoA desaturase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with steatosis develop steatohepatitis. Several factors may contribute to the development of steatohepatitis including cytokines, oxidative stress, and toxic metabolic products of alcohol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokines and inflammation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Neutrophil infiltration and activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most characteristic pathologic hallmarks of alcoholic hepatitis is infiltration of neutrophils, which are generally absent from other forms of inflammatory liver disease, generally in association with an increase in the peripheral neutrophil count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a>). This observation has spawned a vigorous effort to determine if neutrophil infiltration with release of reactive oxygen species and proteases is at least in part responsible for the hepatic disease. Most attention has focused on characterization of mediators which stimulate chemotaxis, and which might direct migration of neutrophils into regions of alcohol metabolism. At least two compounds may be potentially relevant in this regard: interleukin-8 (IL-8) and a lipid metabolite of arachidonic acid.</p><p>IL-8 is a member of the chemokine family, and a known neutrophil chemoattractant. Three studies have documented elevated plasma IL-8 levels in patients with alcoholic hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The plasma IL-8 levels correlated with the severity of hepatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and IL-8 has been identified immunohistochemically in the liver in alcoholic patients. Whether IL-8 is produced locally in the liver and is required for injury to occur are unproven.</p><p>Another neutrophil chemoattractant is an arachidonic acid metabolite related to leukotriene B4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The compound is released by cultured hepatocytes when incubated with ethanol, and requires ethanol metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Its generation probably results from free radical attack on membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One source of these reactive oxygen species may be non-ADH pathways of ethanol oxidation, such as the MEOS. It is of interest that human but not rat neutrophils respond to the compound, which parallels the observation that rats are relatively resistant to ethanol and do not develop an alcoholic hepatitis-like lesion when fed comparable doses of ethanol as human alcoholics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Endotoxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a growing appreciation for the contribution of the gut microbiome to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Elevated levels of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) have been detected in the blood of alcoholics and in animal models exposed to alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and toll-like receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the inflammasome are implicated in these responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Endotoxin interacts with LPS-binding protein and binds to CD14, a receptor on the surface of Kupffer cells (liver macrophages). CD14 interacts with toll-like receptor type 4 (TLR4), which is involved in cytokine activation. It has been hypothesized that the increased levels of LPS contribute to the development of alcoholic liver disease by stimulating inflammatory cytokines. In support of this hypothesis are experiments in mice in which the LPS-binding protein, CD14 receptor, or TLR4 have been knocked out; all of these models are less likely to develop hepatic injury than wild-type controls when challenged with alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In contrast to TLR4, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) may attenuate alcoholic liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, contradictory data have also been published. One experimental model demonstrated that ethanol-fed animals given infusions of LPS developed increased expression of LPS binding protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. While both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines responses were observed, the animals did not develop the net pro-inflammatory cytokine responses observed after acute LPS challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This suggests that alcoholics might develop tolerance to the chronic exposure to LPS and that LPS exposure may not be a central process in the development of alcoholic liver disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Injurious cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have documented increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and interleukin-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/12,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,29</a>]. These factors have been implicated in the hemodynamic alterations found in patients with cirrhosis. A study has implicated the p90RSK kinase pathway as a mediator of both injury and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inflammatory cytokines also correlate with disease severity and histologic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. While their role in alcohol-induced liver injury is unproven, evidence is mounting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In one report, the hepatic inflammation and necrosis observed in ethanol-fed rats were significantly decreased by the administration of neutralizing antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), suggesting a role for this cytokine in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In another study, mice lacking the TNF receptor 1 gene (but not the TNF receptor 2 gene) were protected from the development of liver disease following ethanol ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A related molecule, TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), may also contribute to the pathogenesis of steatosis and liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">COX-2 enzyme</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to TNFa, a role has emerged for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). This enzyme, which produces prostaglandins, is elevated in experimental alcoholic liver injury, raising the possibility that inhibitors may have a therapeutic benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Ethanol-fed rats show increased expression by Kupffer cells of cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA, a key enzyme regulating the production of thromboxanes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Furthermore, thromboxane inhibitors attenuate some of the pathologic changes in these animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It is uncertain whether this approach will be clinically useful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hepatic-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Dietary fat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation may also be influenced by dietary fat. As an example, saturated fat is capable of down-regulating liver injury in experimental alcohol feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The identification of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the <em>PNPLA3</em> gene (also called adiponutrin) that heightens the risk of both nonalcoholic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and alcoholic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] has raised new questions about the importance of fat metabolism in the pathogenesis of this disease. While the exact mechanism of how this protein, which is a phospholipase, amplifies liver injury is unknown, the findings nonetheless focus attention on lipid homeostasis as a pathogenic component of disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxidative stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxidative stress, damage to cells by reactive oxygen species, remains a major factor in alcoholic liver injury and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Diversion of ethanol to minor pathways of oxidation in heavy drinkers may be a critical determinant of liver injury because these pathways are more likely to generate injurious reactive oxygen intermediates than ADH. The main sources of reactive oxygen species are the mitochondria and CYP2E1 in hepatocytes and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in activated Kuppfer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the induction of microsomes (intracellular membrane compartments, such as smooth endoplasmic reticulum) due to spillover from the ADH pathway. The microsomal pathway has been referred to as the microsomal enzyme oxidation system (MEOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Induction of specific components of the MEOS, the membrane associated enzyme, cytochrome CYP2E1 has been documented in alcoholics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] and contributes to the generation of oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>Polymorphisms of CYP2E1 correlate with differences in susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease, although a definitive role for polymorphisms in accounting for variable susceptibility to alcohol susceptibility remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Both ADH and CYP2E1 are more concentrated in the centrizonal region of the hepatic lobule, the area in which alcoholic liver injury is most prominent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic alcohol ingestion also leads to increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels, which increase nitric oxide production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Nitric oxide reacts with reactive oxygen species to produce toxic compounds within the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One reactive species (superoxide) is produced by NADPH oxidase from Kuppfer cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigenic adduct formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acetaldehyde and hydroxyethyl radicals are both derived from the oxidation of ethanol; they bind covalently to proteins, thereby forming adducts that are antigenic. Acetaldehyde, for example, is a highly reactive molecule that can bind avidly to the epsilon amino group of internal lysine residues and the alpha amino N-terminal amino acids of proteins, creating acetaldehyde-protein adducts via a Schiff base mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A number of potential intracellular protein targets have been proposed, including tubulin (a cytoskeletal protein) and collagen, a major component of the hepatic extracellular matrix. There are at least two potentially important consequences of adduct formation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adducts could form with intracellular proteins that are critical to cellular function, leading to dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acetaldehyde protein adducts may serve as neoantigens, provoking both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to attack cells bearing these compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This possibility could explain the large number of immunologic features long recognized in many patients with alcoholic liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Several studies, for example, have identified antibodies in the serum of alcoholics which are reactive to acetaldehyde adducts; however, this observation does not easily explain how the antibodies might attack an intracellular protein. In addition, acetaldehyde-protein adducts have also been detected in patients with nonalcoholic liver disease.</p><p/><p>Hydroxyethyl radical adducts also may play an important role in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In one report, animals given ethanol in vivo generated hydroxyethyl adducts on the external surface of hepatocytes that were recognized by antihydroxyethyl radical adduct antibodies that were present in the sera of cirrhotic patients. In the presence of monocytes, this antigen-antibody complex was able to trigger a cell-mediated cytotoxic reaction that killed the hepatocytes.</p><p>The available data cannot determine if adducts have a pathogenic role or are simply an epiphenomenon of alcohol ingestion. Nevertheless, the last study is suggestive of a potentially important mechanism whereby alcohol can induce liver injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The innate immune system is increasingly implicated in the liver's response to alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. As an example, dendritic cell function may be altered in alcoholic liver disease, an effect that could impair the cell-mediated response to chronic hepatitis C virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Altered dendritic function may also lead to increased release of proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Another study identified reduced expression of a glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein, GILZ, which amplifies macrophage responses and sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. As noted above, inflammasome activation has emerged as a major pathway mediating signals associated with alcoholic liver injury. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Endotoxin'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF FIBROGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Great progress has been made in the past several years in identifying the cellular sources of extracellular matrix (ECM), or scar protein in alcoholic liver injury and in elucidating mechanisms of fibrogenesis. The ECM in fibrotic liver is comprised of several groups of molecules which together gradually form an insoluble scar, remarkably similar to the scar of cutaneous wounds. These components include &quot;interstitial&quot; collagens (types I and III), glycoproteins such as laminin and fibronectin, and proteoglycans such as dermatan and chondroitin sulfate. The composition of the hepatic scar is similar in all forms of fibrosing liver injury, supporting the concept that the fundamental response of the liver to injury is similar whether due to alcohol, drugs, viral infection, or metabolic abnormality (such as hemochromatosis).</p><p>The hepatic stellate cell (also known as Ito cell or lipocyte) is the principal source of the ECM in hepatic fibrosis, including alcoholic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. In normal liver, stellate cells are perisinusoidal cells distributed throughout the liver that are important for storing the bulk of hepatic vitamin A. With liver injury, these cells undergo a characteristic &quot;activation&quot; in which they lose vitamin A, proliferate, and become fibrogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Stellate cell activation has been documented in both experimental alcoholic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] and human alcoholic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Development of methods to isolate stellate cells from rat and human liver has greatly advanced our ability to study these cells and understand how they become activated in vivo. In particular, the release of cytokines from neighboring cells (paracrine activation) and alterations in the surrounding cellular microenvironment contribute to activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/61,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,65</a>]. The major cytokines involved in this process include platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-1, and endothelin-1.</p><p>Mediators unique to alcoholic liver injury may also have a role. Acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol, has minor fibrogenic activity towards cultured stellate cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], but is unlikely to be a significant stimulant in vivo. Alcohol itself has no effect. However, increasing evidence supports a role for lipid aldehydes, which are unstable products of the interaction between reactive oxygen intermediates and cellular proteins. Free radicals responsible for this action could be a product of ethanol oxidation by the non-ADH microsomal enzyme oxidation system. Two lipid aldehydes in particular, 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde, are increased in experimental models of alcohol feeding to rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-70</a>], and may have fibrogenic activity. In addition, there may be other less stable intermediates, which act locally to activate stellate cells and stimulate matrix production. As methods for generating and measuring these unstable compounds improve, more information is likely to emerge about their pathogenic role. A more detailed review of hepatic fibrosis appears elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hepatic-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of liver disease associated with alcohol ingestion is incompletely understood. What is known is that some patients who chronically abuse alcohol develop liver disease, primarily because the liver metabolizes the majority of ingested ethanol. Furthermore, the metabolism of ethanol is required for hepatic injury to occur, although variations in ethanol metabolism do not completely explain the variable susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease. Increasing evidence points to the microbiome and pathways of immune dysregulation as important determinants of liver injury and fibrosis due to alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ethanol is metabolized via several pathways, each of which can contribute to toxicity. The primary hepatic pathway generates acetaldehyde and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61009\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61009 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several factors contribute to the development of alcoholic fatty liver including reduced oxidation of hepatic fatty acids and increased lipogenesis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Alcoholic steatosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all patients with steatosis develop steatohepatitis. Several factors may contribute to the development of steatohepatitis including cytokines, oxidative stress, the microbiome and its products, and toxic metabolic products of alcohol. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Alcoholic steatohepatitis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kaplowitz N, Than TA, Shinohara M, Ji C.
