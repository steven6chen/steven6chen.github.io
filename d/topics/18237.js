Ultrasound guidance allows real-time visualization of nerves, surrounding structures, and the needle-tip to maximize block success and minimize complications. Unlike other imaging modalities (ie, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and computerized tomography [CT]), ultrasound equipment is portable and carries no risk of ionizing radiation.</p><p>This topic will discuss the basic principles of ultrasound imaging, the equipment used, and techniques for ultrasound guidance for peripheral nerve block. Ultrasound guidance for venous access, obstetric ultrasound, echocardiography, and other clinical applications for ultrasound are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Upper extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve blocks of the scalp, neck, and trunk: Techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve blocks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3626478671\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are definitions of commonly used ultrasound-related terms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound</strong> &ndash; The term &quot;ultrasound&quot; refers to sound waves of a frequency greater than that which the human ear can detect; namely, frequencies greater than 20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cycles/second,</span> or Hertz (Hz). Medical imaging requires sound waves of much higher frequency, between 1 and 20 million Hertz (ie, between 1 and 20 megahertz [MHz]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insonation</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Insonation refers to the process of sending ultrasound waves through tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sonoanatomy</strong> &ndash; The appearance of anatomic structures on ultrasound scans is referred to as sonoanatomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acoustic impedance</strong> &ndash; Acoustic impedance is the resistance of a tissue to the passage of sound. Sound waves are reflected at the interface of tissues with different acoustic impedances. As an example, bone reflects sound waves strongly because its acoustic impedance is very high compared with other adjacent tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Attenuation</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Ultrasound attenuation is the decay of sound waves as they travel through tissue as a result of scattering and absorption. Attenuation is a function of distance and frequency of the ultrasound wave [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The frequency of the ultrasound wave is determined by the selected transducer. (See <a href=\"#H853234068\" class=\"local\">'Transducers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resolution</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Resolution is defined as the ability to distinguish between two nearby structures; spatial resolution determines the clarity of the ultrasound image. Resolution of ultrasound imaging includes several spatial components (ie, axial, lateral, and elevational) and a temporal component. Spatial resolution depends primarily on the frequency of insonation and is therefore affected by the selection of the ultrasound transducer. (See <a href=\"#H853234068\" class=\"local\">'Transducers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Echogenicity</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Ultrasonography depends on the return, or echo, of sound waves from a tissue of interest. The returning echo's amplitude, and the resulting brightness on the display screen, is referred to as its echogenicity. Strong reflection of sound waves results in hyperechoic (ie, very bright) images. Bone, air, and fascia are examples of tissues that appear hyperechoic. Solid organs, muscle, and, in some cases, nerves produce grayish, hypoechoic images. Fluid- and blood-filled structures such as blood vessels appear black, or anechoic, because ultrasound moves through them easily. Deep structures can often appear hypoechoic because attenuation limits sound wave transmission, resulting in a weak echo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Doppler effect</strong> &ndash; The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency of wave transmission observed when relative motion occurs between the source of wave transmission and the observer (eg, when blood flows through vessels). Doppler ultrasound can be used to characterize blood flow and to identify vascular structures during needle manipulation. (See <a href=\"#H3239658780\" class=\"local\">'Doppler modes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anisotropy</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Anisotropy is the change in echogenicity that occurs with a change in the angle, or inclination, of the transducer. In general, when structures are imaged obliquely, the amplitude of returning echoes diminishes, and structures appear less echogenic. Anisotropy is most important when imaging tendons and ligaments, but other musculoskeletal structures such as nerves and muscles also exhibit anisotropy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Anisotropy is the reason the clinician must make fine adjustments of the transducer position in order to optimize the image.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2964448882\"><span class=\"h1\">THE WAY ULTRASOUND WORKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ultrasound transducer emits pulses of ultrasound waves that are transmitted through tissue, reflected off of tissue interfaces, and returned as echoes to the transducer. The returning echo is transformed into an electrical signal, which is processed and displayed on a screen as an ultrasound image. The conversion of mechanical force &ndash; in this case, sound waves &ndash; to electrical energy is called the piezoelectric effect. (See <a href=\"#H853234068\" class=\"local\">'Transducers'</a> below.)</p><p>Ultrasound imaging uses echo ranging to create an estimate of the distance to an object. That is, the time it takes for an echo to return to the transducer is converted into a distance using an assumed value of 1540 <span class=\"nowrap\">meters/second</span> for the speed of sound in soft tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4062654235\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND EQUIPMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3484882161\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound machines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For use in the operating room, a variety of portable handheld or cart-mounted ultrasound machines are available. Ultrasound machines include a pulse generator, transducer(s), a receiver that amplifies signals returning to the transducer, a display or monitor that shows the image, and computerized memory that stores images. Most ultrasound machines include options for compound imaging and color-flow Doppler, and allow manual or automatic adjustment of frequency, gain, focus, and depth of scanning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3406245007\"><span class=\"h3\">Spatial compound imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spatial compound imaging is a technology that sends multiple ultrasound beams at predetermined angles, typically within approximately 20 degrees from perpendicular; the received echoes are combined to form a single compound image. Spatial compound imaging reduces angle-dependent artifacts such as posterior acoustic enhancement, refractile shadowing, and anisotropic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2272576588\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound artifacts'</a> below.)</p><p>This technology can also improve visualization of nerves, tissue planes, and needle-tips, and can provide a larger imaging field for a given transducer footprint. Stray lines of sight (ie, those that travel out of the rectangular field of vision under the ultrasound probe) can be used to create a trapezoidal, larger imaging field, which is helpful for initial needle-tip visualization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3239658780\"><span class=\"h3\">Doppler modes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For peripheral nerve block, two modes of Doppler ultrasound imaging are used to identify blood vessels. Doppler mode is selected by pressing a button or turning a knob on the ultrasound machine to add this scanning mode to the basic grayscale scan.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Traditional color Doppler</strong> &ndash; Traditional color Doppler is based on detecting shifts in the mean frequency of the sound wave. When scanning in traditional color Doppler mode, the color on the screen indicates directional motion; blood flowing away from the transducer appears blue, while blood flowing towards the transducer appears red, whether the blood vessel is an artery or a vein. The acronym &quot;BART&quot; (&quot;blue away, red towards&quot;) is often used to describe this display convention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Power Doppler</strong> &ndash; Power Doppler ultrasound integrates the power spectrum of the Doppler signal to produce real-time, color-coded images of blood flow. The technique differs from conventional color Doppler in the way the Doppler signals are processed. The colors in the power Doppler image indicate only that blood flow is present but contain no information on flow velocity or direction. This Doppler mode can help detect small, tortuous arteries that often accompany peripheral nerves. Power Doppler is more sensitive than traditional color Doppler. Because power Doppler has high motion sensitivity, the transducer must be kept very still while imaging in this mode to avoid artifact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108233\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108233 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H853234068\"><span class=\"h2\">Transducers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound transducers contain piezoelectric crystals that generate and receive ultrasound waves. The quality of the ultrasound image is determined primarily by the selection of a transducer with the optimal characteristics (ie, frequency, shape, and size) for the intended application. As an example, a linear probe with a small footprint and high frequency would be used for a shallow nerve block (eg, axillary block), where structures of interest are typically 2 to 3 cm in depth from the skin. In contrast, a low-frequency, curvilinear probe would be used for a deeper block (eg, lumbar plexus block) to view structures that are typically 4 to 8 cm deep.</p><p>Transducers are capable of producing a range of ultrasound frequencies (eg, 2 to 5 MHz, 5 to 10 MHz). They are available with a linear array of crystals on a flat surface or a curvilinear array on a rounded surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59421 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Frequency</strong> &ndash; In general, high-frequency sound waves produce the highest-resolution images but do not penetrate deeply into tissue. Lower-frequency transducers penetrate deeper but provide lower-resolution images.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The ideal transducer for a given nerve block is usually one with the highest frequency that allows adequate depth penetration. In general, the depth of penetration (in centimeters) equals <span class=\"nowrap\">60/f,</span> where f is the transducer center frequency (ie, the mean of the range of frequencies) in megahertz. Therefore, the expected penetration from a 10-MHz center frequency transducer is 6 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Newer transducer technology is being developed that may provide lower attenuation coefficients for a given frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Array shape</strong> &ndash; Linear array transducers display the image in a rectangular shape, mimicking the long, slender appearance of these transducers. They generally have a higher scan line density and produce a higher-quality image than a curvilinear array of similar frequency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Curvilinear transducers provide a broad field of view and provide a sector-shaped image. These transducers generally use a lower frequency range and are useful for scanning deeper structures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The characteristics of ultrasound transducers are discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-safety-of-diagnostic-ultrasound-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and safety of diagnostic ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;, section on 'Transducers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1849981004\"><span class=\"h2\">Needles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><strong>The block needle-tip should be visualized throughout the nerve block procedure</strong> to avoid inadvertent tissue damage or vascular puncture and inaccurate injection of local anesthetic. Metal block needles are hyperechoic and appear white on the ultrasound image; they can be difficult to visualize in bright adipose tissue. Larger needles (ie, 17-gauge Touhy) are easier to visualize and to direct and are therefore useful for deeper blocks, when the angle of insertion is steep. (See <a href=\"#H3805792353\" class=\"local\">'Visualizing the needle'</a> below.)</p><p>A number of block needles have been developed to increase their echogenicity and visibility during ultrasound-guided nerve block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108248\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108248 \">image 2</a>). Most of these technologies are based on texturing the surface of the block needle-tip to reflect sound waves back to the transducer regardless of the angle of insonation (ie, retro-reflection technology). In addition, machine-based technologies have been developed for needle enhancement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108247\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108247 \">image 3</a>). A limitation of the machine-based technologies is that they enhance the entire needle echo, rather than selectively enhancing the tip.</p><p>Novel technologies are being developed to improve needle visualization (eg, magnetic needle guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]), but clinical experience with their use is limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1470639855\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral blocks are performed with real-time ultrasound (ie, scanning during needle placement and injection).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2211383968\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation for scanning</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150794323\"><span class=\"h3\">Ergonomics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound scanning should be performed with the clinician and the patient positioned to minimize strain and muscle fatigue, and to facilitate the movements required for successful block placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Table height</strong> &ndash; The table should be positioned such that the clinician can sit or stand straight, without needing to lean or stretch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hand support</strong> &ndash; Both the hand holding the transducer and the hand holding the needle should be supported for stability and to avoid fatigue. The transducer should be held close to the face of the device, with the arm or hand resting on the patient's body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Operator body orientation</strong> &ndash; When possible, the clinician should stand or sit directly behind the transducer with a line of sight along the needle path.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitor position</strong> &ndash; The ultrasound machine should be positioned in front of the clinician to allow a comfortable direct line of sight.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H843669577\"><span class=\"h3\">Time out</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A preprocedure time out should be performed, which includes confirmation of patient identifiers, allergies, planned surgical procedure including laterality, surgical and anesthesia consents with site marked if applicable, and coagulation status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1752613137\"><span class=\"h3\">Gel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound waves do not travel well through air; coupling gel, which is placed on the patient's skin, removes air between the transducer and the skin. For peripheral nerve block, gel must be placed on the transducer inside the sterile sleeve and also on the patient's skin.</p><p>Gel also permits the probe to slide without resistance along the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1758485039\"><span class=\"h3\">Scout scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A scout scan (ie, a preliminary scan without sterile technique, also referred to as prescanning) may be useful in some cases. As an example, for larger patients or those with difficult anatomy, a scout scan can help determine whether a supraclavicular or infraclavicular brachial plexus block would be preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3419429155\"><span class=\"h3\">Sterile technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral nerve block must be performed using sterile technique and universal precautions.

The plastic must be smoothly applied, without trapped air bubbles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile gel should be applied to the skin at the block site.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H912587693\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle orientation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The block needle can be inserted either in plane (along the axis of the ultrasound beam and transducer) or out of plane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97801\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97801 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F97800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97800 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>In plane</strong> &ndash; Using the in-plane approach, the needle is inserted parallel to the long side of the transducer and is visualized in long-axis so the full needle is visualized. This permits the tip of the needle to be visualized at all times. The main challenge of the in-plane technique is to keep the entire needle-tip and shaft within the plane of imaging, rather than only part of the shaft (a partial lineup) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108245\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108245 \">image 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3805792353\" class=\"local\">'Visualizing the needle'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Out of plane</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>With the out-of-plane view of the needle, the needle is inserted perpendicular to the transducer. A cross-section of the needle appears as a small dot, which can be difficult to identify. It can be challenging to maintain a view of the needle throughout the entire procedure, and it is not always possible to distinguish the tip from other portions of the needle. The out-of-plane technique is often used for deeper blocks, where it is more difficult to visualize the entire length of the needle to the target nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2272576588\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound artifacts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of artifacts can occur during scanning and can interfere with the quality of the image. However, characteristic artifacts can also be useful clinical indicators. As examples, a comet tail artifact can be used to estimate lung water, and the hyoid bone can often be identified by its acoustic shadow. Common ultrasound artifacts include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acoustic shadowing</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Acoustic shadowing refers to the creation of a black, anechoic region behind an intensely reflective substance. Bone and air reflect and absorb ultrasound waves, thereby creating acoustic shadows that can obscure deeper structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108239\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108239 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108237\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108237 \">image 6</a>). Heavily calcified intravascular plaque can also produce acoustic shadowing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108238\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108238 \">image 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterior acoustic enhancement</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Acoustic enhancement (also referred to as increased through-transmission) occurs deep to anechoic and hypoechoic fluids that absorb less sound than the surrounding tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. This enhancement can be observed deep to blood vessels or injected local anesthetic (LA). Acoustic enhancement is often observed deep to the second part of the axillary artery during infraclavicular block, in the axilla, deep to the axillary vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108236\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108236 \">image 8</a>), or deep to the femoral artery during femoral nerve block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108234\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108234 \">image 9</a>). This artifact is important because it can resemble nerve echotexture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Refractile shadowing</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Refractile or lateral-edge shadowing is a form of acoustic shadowing that occurs deep to the edges of blood vessels or, less commonly, from the sides of tendons or nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108240\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108240 \">image 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reverberation</strong> &ndash; Reverberation occurs when the ultrasound beam bounces back and forth between reflective surfaces before returning to the transducer, resulting in discrete bands of echoes. Comet tail artifacts and needle reverberation are common forms of reverberation artifacts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108241\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108241 \">image 11</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3153089725\" class=\"local\">'Optimizing the image'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Speed of sound</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Speed of sound artifacts can be observed during regional blocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The speed of sound in soft tissue is approximately 1540 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/second</span>. Variations in the speed of sound within tissue are possible, depending on the mechanical properties of the tissue types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The bayonet artifact is an example of a speed of sound artifact; an artifactual discrete needle bend can occur at the transition between tissues with different speeds of sound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108242\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108242 \">image 12</a>). This apparent bend remains in the same anatomic location when the needle is advanced. Bayonet artifacts are often observed during lateral popliteal blocks, in which the needle approaches nearly perpendicular to the sound wave, crossing a transition from muscle to subcutaneous adipose tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1458751042\"><span class=\"h2\">Image acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We follow a sequence of steps when performing an ultrasound-guided nerve block, including finding the nerve or relevant anatomic space, optimizing the image, and visualizing and maintaining the view of the needle.

For many peripheral nerve blocks, the transducer is positioned so that the target nerves are viewed in short axis. Orientation is individualized for interfascial plane blocks (eg, transversus abdominis plane block) and compartment blocks (eg, thoracic paravertebral block).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Medial verus lateral</strong> &ndash; Ultrasound transducers typically have a palpable notch or ridge on one side that is used to help orient the transducer to the ultrasound screen. The screen shows a dot (usually blue) that corresponds to the indicator on the transducer. Correct orientation can be confirmed by touching the end of the transducer and watching for motion in the corresponding corner of the image on the screen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stabilization</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Both the hand holding the transducer and the hand holding the needle should be supported for stability. (See <a href=\"#H150794323\" class=\"local\">'Ergonomics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transducer motions</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>During scanning, the transducer is manipulated to change the direction and orientation of the ultrasound beam (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107821\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107821 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Sliding</strong> &ndash; The transducer is moved across the skin along the course of a nerve, maintaining a short-axis view.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Compression</strong> &ndash; Compressing soft tissue with the transducer may improve imaging and is used to confirm venous structures (ie, veins compress easily, while arteries do not).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Tilting</strong> &ndash; The transducer is tilted side to side around its long axis. Tilting can change the echogenicity of the nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Rotation</strong> &ndash; Rotation is used an oblique view to produce a true short- or long-axis view.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Rocking</strong> &ndash; Rocking the probe by tilting it in plane may be used to improve visibility of the needle or anatomic structures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2009408685\"><span class=\"h3\">Finding the nerve or space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many peripheral nerve blocks, the goal is to visualize individual nerves and to then inject LA near those nerves. Peripheral nerves often exhibit polyfascicular echotexture, meaning a large number of hypoechoic fascicles can be identified with surrounding hyperechoic connective tissue (&quot;honeycomb&quot; appearance) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108244\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108244 \">image 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108243\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108243 \">image 14</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Central nerves (such as the cervical ventral rami for interscalene block) can have a monofascicular or oligofascicular appearance on ultrasound scans, meaning only one or a few hypoechoic fascicles can be identified. What appear to be nerve fascicles are actually groups of nerve fascicles because the very fine layers of collagen that separate individual nerve fibers are usually too thin to be visualized with ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>For some peripheral nerve blocks, the nerves themselves are not visualized or targeted; rather, we visualize an anatomic space known to contain the nerves or structures near the nerves. This type of technique is used for compartment blocks and interfascial plane blocks. As an example, for a transversus abdominis plane block, the needle-tip and LA injection are placed in the fascial plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, where thoracic intercostal nerves run. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques#H493074890\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve blocks of the scalp, neck, and trunk: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Transversus abdominis plane block technique'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3153089725\"><span class=\"h3\">Optimizing the image</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the intended target is found, the image can be optimized by manipulating the transducer, minimizing artifact, and adjusting machine settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H375130814\"><span class=\"h4\">Manipulating the transducer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The various transducer motions can be used to refine the image and identify structures during scanning. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compression may be used for some peripheral nerve blocks (eg, axillary block), to identify blood vessels and distinguish arteries from veins, or to move blood vessels out of the needle path (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108236\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108236 \">image 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tilting the probe during scanning can enhance the echogenicity by using the anisotropic properties of the intended nerve (eg, popliteal block).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rocking the transducer may help to increase the visualized space for needle insertion (eg, during infraclavicular block).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3638200709\"><span class=\"h4\">Minimizing artifact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some ultrasound artifacts can be prevented, reduced, or eliminated to improve image quality. As examples, coupling gel reduces contact artifact, and spatial compound imaging technology reduces angle-dependent artifacts (eg, posterior acoustic enhancement, refractile shadowing, and anisotropic effects). (See <a href=\"#H3406245007\" class=\"local\">'Spatial compound imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>Air creates acoustic shadowing that can obscure deeper structures. Therefore, injection of air should be avoided during LA infiltration prior to nerve block, and the block needle and connected tubing should be flushed with LA prior to needle insertion into the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H323403700\"><span class=\"h4\">Maximizing machine settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound imaging technology has been increasingly automated, with preset machine settings that reduce, but do not eliminate, the need for fine-tuning. Newer machines feature touchscreens rather than knobs, although the subject of image optimization is still referred to as &quot;knobology.&quot; The following parameters should be adjusted to optimize the ultrasound image:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depth </strong>&ndash; Set depth so that target structures are in the center of the field of imaging according to the initial range of depth settings appropriate for the planned nerve block (eg, 2 to 11 cm, depending on the block) and the patient's body habitus. Adjust as necessary based on the image.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Focus</strong> &ndash; Set the focus to mid-field or deeper. Avoid setting the focus too shallow, which would result in a wider beam and lower resolution in the deeper imaging field.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gain</strong> &ndash; Set the receiver gain to optimize the overall information content of the image. Needle-tip visibility is usually better with low receiver gain because identifying a bright needle-tip is easier with a dark background. Time gain compensation (TGC) sliders are used to selectively amplify echoes that return to the transducer at a certain time, and are used to vary the gain in different parts of the image.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3805792353\"><span class=\"h3\">Visualizing the needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A basic principle of ultrasound-guided nerve block is that <strong>the needle-tip should be visualized throughout the procedure</strong>. The needle should not be advanced without identifying the tip. The most important factors influencing needle-tip visibility are the needle's gauge and angle of insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Needle bevel orientation is also important to needle tip visibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-for-peripheral-nerve-blocks/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The bevel should be oriented to face the transducer in order to enhance needle-tip imaging.</p><p>We follow a sequence of steps to identify and maintain visualization of the block needle.</p><p>For an in-plane approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108245\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108245 \">image 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look at the needle and transducer prior to insertion to align their axes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify the target structure and tilt the transducer to maximize nerve brightness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain the tilt, and slide the transducer towards the needle until the needle comes into view.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rotate the transducer until the full needle is in view, if necessary.</p><p/><p>For an out-of-plane approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look at the needle and transducer prior to insertion, making sure the needle will be inserted at the midpoint of the transducer, with its axis perpendicular to the axis of the transducer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify the target structure, and tilt the transducer to maximize nerve brightness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the needle until the tip crosses the plane of imaging as an echogenic (white) dot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slide the transducer along the axis of the needle, following the tip as the needle is advanced.</p><p/><p>Hydrodissection refers to the injection of fluid (usually normal saline) through the block needle to help dissect the tissue at the tip of the needle. This technique can help to confirm needle tip location (eg, in the transverse abdominis plane) and can separate tissue planes to maneuver the block needle to the desired target. As an example, during an axillary nerve block, hydrodissection can be used to open the plane between the axillary artery and terminal branches of the brachial plexus.</p><p>Differences in important outcomes have been difficult to demonstrate when comparing in-plane versus out-of-plane approaches to regional blocks. Therefore, the overall quality of the guidance is more important than the approach per se. Accurate identification of the needle-tip, nerve borders, and surrounding anatomic structures is critical to the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2614930056\"><span class=\"h2\">Injection of local anesthetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several sonographic signs of regional block success. In general, local anesthetic (LA) should track around and along peripheral nerves and their branches. During injection, specific sonographic signs of success are associated with some nerve blocks (eg, a U-shaped distribution deep to the axillary artery for infraclavicular block, or anterior displacement of the pleura with injection for thoracic paravertebral block). The distribution of LA can be confirmed after injection by sliding the transducer along course of the nerve or anatomic space.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3620775017\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound imaging for peripheral nerve block allows real-time visualization of nerves, surrounding structures, the block needle-tip, and local anesthetic (LA) injection to maximize block success and minimize complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound machines include technologies that improve image quality, allow identification of blood vessels, and automate image optimization.
