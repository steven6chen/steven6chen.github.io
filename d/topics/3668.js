The detailed pediatric neurologic examination, acute illnesses accompanied by seizures, and febrile seizures are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in children: Classification, etiology, and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of febrile seizures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of neonatal seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of children with epilepsy have an idiopathic disorder with a normal neurologic examination and neuroimaging studies. Thus, a careful history is the cornerstones of an accurate diagnosis. A detailed account of the child's behavior preceding, during, and following a &quot;spell&quot; is critical. This account may require a follow-up visit with witnesses or a phone call to individuals, such as a teacher, who actually saw the &quot;seizure.&quot; The physician should remember to include the child in the conversation; quite often the child provides valuable information.</p><p>The physician can ask the parent or witness to mime the event, or the physician can mimic different kinds of seizures to find a match for the child's episodes. Often the family or the initial physician involved with the child will describe the episode as simply a &quot;grand mal&quot; or &quot;petit mal&quot; seizure. Frequently, the physician is told that the child had &quot;staring episodes&quot; or &quot;fell down and shook all over.&quot; These descriptions are not adequate for arriving at a definite diagnosis.</p><p>The physician should not accept a previous diagnosis of &quot;epilepsy&quot; without taking the child's history. The historians should be asked to describe the seizures in degree of severity (ie, the mildest to the most severe). Often the large seizures (ie, generalized tonic-clonic) are preceded by the identical symptoms that occur in the minor ones, confirming the suspicion of a focal seizure with secondary generalization. However, some children have two or more seizure types. The brief focal signs or aura prior to the more dramatic event, or the important localizing symptoms following the seizure, may be missed in a cursory history. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure may be preceded by brief twitching of one side of the face and followed by a transient language disorder consistent with a dysphasia, supporting the diagnosis of a focal seizure arising in the dominant hemisphere, with secondary generalization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Setting in which episodes occur</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most seizures occur at random and without warning. In contrast, many nonepileptic spells have characteristic precipitating circumstances or occur in specific locations. Determining the time of day and the activity in which the child was engaged prior to the seizure is important.</p><p>Important questions to consider include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were the seizures primarily nocturnal and, if so, what time of the night did they occur?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the child taking medication (prescription and over-the-counter) or herbal substances prior to the seizure? Several herbal supplements, including St. John's wort, MaHuang, and Kava kava have caused seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the seizures occur only with illness and fever? Seizures occurring in the setting of fever alone may represent febrile seizures, rather than epilepsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of febrile seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the seizure occur in the setting of other acute medical events (eg, acute head injury, other acute medical illness)? Such seizures may be provoked and at lower risk of recurrence than nonprovoked seizures. As an example, in one study, children who had a seizure in the setting of acute gastroenteritis had a particularly low risk of seizure recurrence compared to other children with a first seizures (HR = 0.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the seizures occur only when the child was relaxed and never occur when actively involved in some type of activity? (More likely nonseizure events).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavior immediately prior to the event</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On rare occasions, seizures may be precipitated by environmental stimuli such as sound or an unexpected touch (reflex epilepsy). More commonly, no obvious precipitating circumstances are present. Thus, obtaining a history of the events leading up to the seizure is important because they may be more suggestive of a non-seizure diagnosis.</p><p>Important questions to consider include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do the episodes always occur when the child is upset and crying (cyanotic breath-holding spells); only after a minor blow to the head or upper torso (pallid infantile syncope); only in the classroom and never seen by the parents (staring episodes are commonly seen in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); or always when standing and preceded by nausea and dizziness (simple vasovagal syncope)? (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What activity was the patient engaged in immediately prior to the seizure? Does the patient mention any sensory or autonomic symptoms (numbness, visual distortions, auditory or visual hallucinations or illusions, nausea or unusual feelings in the abdomen or chest, an unusual smell or taste, etc) or manifest an alteration in behavior or mood?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or headache occur before or after the seizure? Headaches are not uncommon after a generalized convulsive seizure but are infrequent before a seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nausea and vomiting more often are seen in association with a migraine syndrome, which can mimic a seizure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are the seizures precipitated by a particular stimulus? Seizures are rarely precipitated by mild trauma. Pallid infantile syncope is a common benign pediatric syndrome characterized by sudden transient bradycardia followed by an anoxic seizure (with pallor) and spontaneous recovery that are precipitated by a mild unexpected blow to the head and upper torso. It is caused by excessive vagal tone and is of unknown etiology. Pointed questioning may be necessary to uncover the history of mild trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were focal signs or symptoms present? Examples include face or extremity twitching, an illusion of a bad smell or taste, and a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu experience. Some of these symptoms are considered an &quot;aura,&quot; or a focal seizure involving subjective sensory or psychic phenomena, which may be the first clinical manifestation of the seizure. This information can be valuable for localizing the epileptic focus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Patients may not remember these symptoms because retrograde amnesia often accompanies seizures, particularly those with generalized motor activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the child predictably cry before a seizure? In studies of adults, weeping during an event was typical of a nonepileptic seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Consistent crying before a &quot;seizure&quot; is suggestive of a cyanotic breath-holding spell.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical description</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physician should obtain a description of the patient's color during the event and determine whether anyone checked the child's heart rate or pulse. Anoxic nonepileptic seizures may be secondary to a cardiac arrhythmia. If a child has a color change during a seizure, particularly a generalized motor seizure, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> usually will become cyanotic. A cardiac cause for the event should be considered if the child is described as pale. A description of forceful eye or head deviation to one side can be a useful localizing feature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavior during the event</span></p><p>Important questions to consider include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are limb movements unilateral, bilateral, synchronous, clonic (rhythmic flexion movements or rhythmically interrupted tonus), or irregular and thrashing? Bilateral motor seizures, particularly those involving all the extremities and the trunk with generalized, relatively symmetric, tonic or clonic movements, are usually associated with altered consciousness. A nonepileptic seizure should be suspected if the patient has generalized motor activity with normal responsiveness, particularly if it lasts longer than 5 minutes. Prolonged waxing and waning of clonic or tonic activity or stimulus-provoked <span class=\"nowrap\">clonic/tonic</span> activity during a generalized motor seizure is more consistent with a nonepileptic seizure. Repeatedly and consistently stereotyped behaviors suggest seizures as compared to nonepileptic events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are the eyes and mouth closed? A nonepileptic seizure should be considered if the patient keeps the eyes tightly closed during the seizure and, particularly, if passive eye opening is actively resisted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Sustained eye deviation or nystagmoid eye movements are relatively subtle clinical manifestations of seizure activity. Patients with true generalized motor seizures tend to keep their mouths open during the tonic phase of the seizure; in generalized motor nonepileptic seizures, the mouth is partially or tightly closed (clenched).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What was the patient's response to verbal commands, pinching, or more painful stimulation? Generalized motor seizures cannot be interrupted by vocal or <span class=\"nowrap\">tactile/painful</span> stimulation. In contrast, a patient with a nonepileptic seizure may suddenly return to normal after a painful stimulus or shouting of his or her name. However, an abrupt return to consciousness is often seen in frontal lobe seizures and should not be considered a reliable sign of nonepileptic seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What was the duration of the event? Most seizures are short-lived; an episode of confusion or loss of contact with the environment that lasts more than five minutes should raise the suspicion of a nonepileptic event.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavior after the event</span></p><p>Important questions to consider include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What was the patient's behavior after the event (postictal state)? Did he or she recover immediately, or was there confusion or somnolence? Was the child able to communicate verbally immediately after the event (eg, could the patient form appropriate and full sentences; was the child oriented; could the child follow complex or simple verbal commands)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were there focal findings during the postictal state, such as a hemiparesis (Todd's paralysis)? These features are helpful for localization. As an example, if a child had a generalized motor seizure, but in the postictal period could not talk despite being able to follow simple commands (postictal dysphasia), a focal onset in the speech area of the dominant hemisphere would be suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropsychological and social assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epilepsy is often accompanied by cognitive and developmental delay, including autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. One study compared 282 children with normal IQ and a first recognized seizure to 147 healthy siblings and found that children with seizures scored lower on all neuropsychological tests; 27 percent had a neuropsychological deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Risk factors for neuropsychological impairment included a <span class=\"nowrap\">symptomatic/cryptogenic</span> etiology, a second unprovoked seizure, use of antiseizure drugs, and epileptiform activity on the initial electroencephalogram (EEG). When developmental delay <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intellectual impairment is overt, the child should be referred for appropriate evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a>.) The most appropriate method of screening other children with epilepsy for intellectual impairments is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Children with epilepsy are also more likely to have psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Specific assessment and management of these conditions is likely to be beneficial in the child&rsquo;s overall prognosis.</p><p>The psychological stresses associated with epilepsy can be the major problem confronting the child or family. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) can be affected even after a single seizure; but overall, deficits in HRQOL in children with epilepsy are related to seizure frequency and severity, as well as socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. The child may have difficulty at school because of peer ridicule, a poor academic performance as a result of limited cognitive function, low self-esteem, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression. The patient's mental health should be specifically addressed at regular follow-up evaluations, and the appropriate referral to a mental health specialist considered if significant issues are uncovered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other elements of the history</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A developmental history should be obtained, with particular attention given to any plateau or loss of developmental milestones. In older children, a history of academic performance and social interactions are also essential parts of the history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The examiner should search for a history of previous illnesses that are associated with seizures (eg, meningitis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, head trauma).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed family history is mandatory. Consanguinity should raise a suspicion of an inherited disorder, particularly a recessively-inherited inborn error of metabolism. A family history of seizures may suggest a dominantly inherited epileptic disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The teenager with seizures should be questioned about drug use. A random drug screen might be considered if illicit drug use or withdrawal is suspected as a cause of seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general history and physical examination of children with seizures includes several elements.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to searching for medical causes of the patient's seizures, close attention should be paid to the eye examination. The physician should look for congenital ocular defects, the retinal changes associated with certain neurocutaneous and neurodegenerative disorders, or signs of an earlier infection. Ophthalmology consultation should be obtained if the funduscopic examination is difficult, as in the active infant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The abdominal examination may reveal hepatosplenomegaly, suggesting a storage disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cardiac examination, including an ECG, is necessary if concern exists about a cardiogenic cause for the patient's episodes. Episodes of disturbed neurologic function caused by decreased cardiac output (eg, prolonged QT syndrome or pulmonary hypertension) may closely mimic focal seizures, including the presence of an aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A genetic assessment is important. Dysmorphic features and other congenital anomalies, body asymmetries, and unusual skull shapes should be noted. As an example, we see many children with a referral diagnosis of cerebral palsy and epilepsy who have the obvious and often striking clinical and dysmorphic features of Angelman syndrome, a chromosomal disorder caused by a deletion of chromosome 15q12.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin examination is of particular importance in the evaluation of children with seizures as many neurocutaneous disorders are associated with epilepsy. The cutaneous features of tuberous sclerosis, the facial angioma of Sturge-Weber syndrome, the caf&eacute;-au-lait spots of neurofibromatosis, the nevi of the linear nevus syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and the swirling hypopigmentation of Ito syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] all are characteristic physical findings. Wood's lamp examination to identify the hypopigmented macules (ash leaf spots) of tuberous sclerosis is an essential feature of the examination of a child with seizures. Dermatological consultation should be considered in a child with seizures who has a skin lesion that cannot be identified easily. Most neurocutaneous disorders are hereditary and, if identified, should lead to family counseling and possibly genetic consultation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a valuable adjunct to the assessment of children with suspected seizures. Virtually every child with recurrent seizures should have an EEG awake and while sleeping. Each EEG recording should be performed with specific questions in mind, an understanding and anticipation of the possible results, and a planned response to these results.</p><p>The value of the EEG interpretation is related directly to the interpretive skills of the electroencephalographer. Only individuals with significant pediatric experience are able to recognize the characteristic features of a benign epileptic disorder and differentiate it from more serious syndromes. A phone consultation with the electroencephalographer prior to the EEG often is helpful in planning the study. Obtaining an EEG recording during sleep and wakefulness and optimizing the timing of the EEG will help maximize the chances of finding epileptiform activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep EEG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An awake and asleep EEG should always be obtained. Epileptiform activity may appear in only one state (usually sleep). Even if epileptiform activity is evident on the initial awake tracing, a sleep recording is indicated. As an example, in the benign focal epilepsies, focal or multifocal spike and slow wave discharges, which are diagnostic of these syndromes, typically appear only during drowsiness and light sleep. In these children, fragments of generalized spike and wave activity can be seen during wakefulness and may erroneously suggest a generalized epilepsy. The benign focal epilepsy syndromes may also manifest a photoparoxysmal response (epileptiform activity provoked by repetitive light flashes), however, these are more typically are seen in the idiopathic generalized epilepsies.</p><p>The child should be allowed to sleep naturally in the EEG laboratory. Many laboratories use sleep deprivation by requesting that the child is kept up a significant portion of the night prior to the EEG. However, while this technique increases the likelihood of recording sleep, studies suggest that it may not increase the chance of finding epileptiform activity in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], although it may in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While sleep deprivation increases the likelihood of detecting epileptiform discharges, even in the absence of recording sleep, the increased yield is modest. One study found that 11 sleep-deprived EEGs would be required to identify one additional child with epileptiform discharges compared to a routine EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Sleep-deprivation can be a difficult task for parents, and sleep-deprived children, particularly those with cognitive impairment or behavioral disorders, can be difficult to manage in the EEG laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one case series the diagnostic yield of a sleep-deprived EEG was similar to that of an EEG obtained within 24 hours of a seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of the EEG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The EEG should be obtained as soon as possible after a seizure, particularly if an initial EEG was normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In most patients, the incidence of epileptiform discharges is highest in the first 24 hours after a seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In some children, however, the EEG immediately after a seizure will be normal or will show nonspecific background abnormalities (postictal slowing) but no epileptiform activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Obtaining repeat EEGs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the diagnosis is still in question after the initial EEG, a repeat tracing should be done. One group found the initial EEG to be normal in 44 percent of 552 children ages one month to 16 years with one or more newly diagnosed idiopathic or remote symptomatic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When the EEG was repeated with sleep deprivation in 177 children with an initially normal EEG, epileptiform abnormalities were found in 61 (35 percent), increasing the yield of an abnormal test by 11 percent.</p><p>Attempts should be made to obtain the repeat EEG at a time when the child is most likely to have a seizure. As an example, the EEG should be done in the morning if seizures are occurring primarily in the morning upon awakening (as often occurs in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). If the seizures are nocturnal (as often occurs in frontal lobe and benign rolandic epilepsy), an all-night sleep recording in the laboratory or an ambulatory EEG should be considered.</p><p>More than three repeat EEGs adds little further information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Up to 30 to 50 percent of children with epilepsy will be &quot;EEG-negative.&quot; In patients with serial negative EEGs and an undiagnosed paroxysmal disorder, inpatient video-EEG or ambulatory EEG recording can be helpful. Before considering one of these more expensive procedures, the case should be discussed with an epileptologist to maximize the chances of obtaining useful information on the EEG and to explore other possibilities in the differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of the EEG to determine the type of epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interictal epileptiform pattern on the EEG is often used to help determine the epilepsy syndrome and consequently the class of antiseizure drug (ie, narrow or broad spectrum) used for treatment. As examples, medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxcarbazepine</a> often are used for focal epilepsies, whereas valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethosuximide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ethosuximide</a> are preferred for the generalized epilepsies. However, the EEG pattern should not be used exclusively to make treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The detailed clinical description of the child's behavior during a seizure is equally, if not more, important than is the EEG in selecting an antiseizure drug.</p><p>The most informative aspects of the interictal EEG pattern are the background organization and the morphology and topography of epileptiform discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Stereotyped, generalized interictal discharges in the setting of a normal background suggest a genetic generalized epilepsy, whereas pleomorphic, multifocal discharges on a diffusely slowed background suggest an epileptogenic encephalopathy. Focal structural epilepsies often manifest pleomorphic focal discharges and focal background slowing. By contrast, the focal discharges seen in self-limited focal epilepsies such as benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes are associated with a normal background.

In a second report, epileptiform abnormalities were found in 131 of 3,726 normal children (3.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Follow-up studies over an eight-to-nine-year period showed that only 7 individuals subsequently developed epilepsy. The most common abnormalities were centrotemporal spikes (37 cases) and generalized spike and wave discharges (10 cases). There was a history of febrile seizures in 19 percent of the children with epileptiform discharges, and in 9 percent of those without EEG abnormalities. A higher incidence of epileptiform activity was also noted in the families, particularly the siblings, of children with idiopathic epilepsy, as well as in children with transient metabolic or other acute illnesses. With digital EEG recordings, the prevalence may be higher; in one prospective case series, 6.5 percent of 382 healthy children (except for recent mild head trauma) had epileptiform discharges on routine EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROIMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial investigation should be directed toward finding a structural abnormality as the basis of the seizures, thereby avoiding expensive laboratory tests for the less common inherited neurometabolic, degenerative, or developmental disorders.

In one case series of 150 children with a first afebrile, unprovoked seizure, significant MRI abnormalities were present in 16 percent and were associated with a significant increased risk of seizure recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A community-based study of 518 children with epilepsy also revealed a 16 percent incidence of relevant MRI abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>MRI is the preferred neuroimaging study for the evaluation of a child with seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting brain malformations and dysplastic lesions, as well as subtle temporal lobe pathology, particularly in the hippocampus, a common site of seizure onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Gadolinium contrast is not routinely requested, but is used when tumor, vascular malformation, inflammation, or infection is suspected based on clinical information or review of noncontrast study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Special thin cuts and imaging angles are necessary to adequately assess hippocampal anatomy and are part of the standard MRI &quot;seizure protocol&quot; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-in-the-evaluation-of-seizures-and-epilepsy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging in the evaluation of seizures and epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Epilepsy protocol for MRI'</a>). Special MRI sequences are required in children younger than two years as immature myelination patterns may obscure some pathologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. MRI in these younger patients should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sagittal, axial, and coronal T1-weighted sequences in children one to two years of age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sagittal, axial, and coronal high-resolution T2-weighted sequences in children less than one year of age</p><p/><p>If the MRI is normal in children less than two years of age and seizures persist, a follow-up study after 30 months of age may allow for visualization of an underlying cortical dysplasia when more mature myelination patterns have developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This should be considered when seizures are intractable. Where available and when performed and interpreted with an appropriate level of expertise, MR spectroscopy can add diagnostic value in selected patients (eg, distinguishing neoplasm from dysplasia) or prompt more intensified evaluation for inborn errors of metabolism or other genetic causes of epilepsy (eg, unexplained lactate peak on an otherwise normal MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In children with temporal lobe epilepsy, MRI abnormalities (eg, hippocampal sclerosis, tumor, cortical dysplasia) are associated with a higher likelihood of medical intractability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. While computed tomography (CT) scan is better than MRI in identifying calcifications associated with congenital infections (eg, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis) and some of the neurocutaneous syndromes (eg, tuberous sclerosis), MRI is usually also abnormal in these settings.</p><p>A CT scan is most often used for emergency department assessment. In the setting of a first seizure, a noncontrast CT scan reveals findings that change acute management in 3 to 9 percent of children and infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43</a>]. Among children with a first seizure that is apparently unprovoked, the risk of an urgent finding may be even lower: in a prospective multicenter study of 475 children (age 1 month to 18 years) with an unprovoked first seizure, CT or MRI identified an <span class=\"nowrap\">emergent/urgent</span> finding in 0.8 percent of patients and nonurgent findings in an additional 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Infants less than six months of age will have a clinical relevant abnormality on CT scan 50 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43</a>]. Additional risk factors for a clinically relevant abnormality on CT or MRI include focal seizures, focal examination findings, and high-risk past medical history (eg, history of a brain tumor or other neoplasm, stroke, coagulopathy, sickle cell disease, cardiac defect, or ventricular shunt) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>As mentioned above, neuroimaging may not be necessary in children who have an obvious cause for their seizures identified on the history and physical examination. In addition, children with clearly benign epilepsy based upon the history, family history, and EEG may also not need imaging studies. Most other children with seizures should have an MRI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a child presents with a first seizure, the initial evaluation is directed toward uncovering a potential medical etiology. If an acute cause cannot be found, the child may be experiencing the initial seizure of an epileptic disorder. A discussion of the numerous tests indicated in the search for an underlying etiology of acute seizures is beyond the scope of this section. This section will emphasize the more common studies performed in the child with seizures of unknown etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Who should be tested?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extensive diagnostic testing may not be necessary if the history and physical examination provide an obvious etiology for the seizure. As an example, the infant with a history of pneumococcal meningitis and persistent seizures does not need extensive metabolic or genetic testing, although baseline laboratory examinations are indicated prior to initiating anticonvulsant therapy.</p><p>Similarly, the normal child with nocturnal generalized seizures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diurnal focal seizures involving the face and upper extremity without impairment of consciousness whose EEG shows bilateral, independent centrotemporal spike and wave discharges, particularly if a family history of seizures exists, may not have to undergo imaging studies. The diagnosis of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood) can be made without these studies.</p><p>An extensive laboratory metabolic investigation may be withheld until the course of the epilepsy is better defined. A child with an inherited neurometabolic disorder is not likely to continue to have seizures, remain cognitively and developmentally normal, and have entirely normal EEG background patterns for several years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory screening in undiagnosed epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If history and physical examination and MRI do not reveal an etiology for seizures, the child should be evaluated for potential underlying metabolic, genetic, immune-mediated, or neurodegenerative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Initial studies to consider in infants and children with unexplained seizures, particularly those with developmental delay and abnormal neurologic examination include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum (and CSF) amino acid analysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine for quantitative organic acids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum calcium, glucose, liver function tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum acylcarnitine profile, ammonia, lactate and pyruvate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial blood gas and pH</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF lactate and glucose (paired with blood glucose)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal karyotype</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum and CSF autoantibodies (eg, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor [NMDAR] antibodies)</p><p/><p>In a retrospective review of patients with refractory epilepsy and developmental delay, metabolic abnormalities were identified in more than 70 percent of those without a previously identified diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Multifocal interictal epileptiform discharges were associated with a finding of metabolic abnormality.</p><p>Virtually all chromosomal syndromes can manifest seizures. Another consideration in this regard is DNA analysis for fragile X syndrome in both boys and girls with maternal family histories of mental retardation. Approximately 20 percent of males with fragile X syndrome have seizures, and female carriers of fragile X syndrome, even some with normal intelligence, can have seizures with focal EEG abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. More sophisticated genetic analyses such as FISH studies and chromosomal microarrays may be needed to diagnose those syndromes missed on routine karyotype analysis, such as Angelman and Rett syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be examined for routine chemistries (protein, glucose) as well as lactate and amino acids. A tube should be frozen if needed for future measurement of metabolites and neurotransmitters associated with rare neurometabolic disorders.</p><p>Several forms of immune-mediated encephalitis can present in childhood and adolescence, including anti-NMDAR encephalitis and encephalitis associated with antibodies to other synaptic proteins such as contactin associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Such disorders can present with a broad range of symptoms in an otherwise healthy child, including psychosis, catatonia, behavioral and memory alterations, seizures, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation. Unlike adults, children often do not have an underlying tumor or malignancy identified. While rare, these disorders are important to recognize because they may be highly responsive to immunotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A low CSF glucose in a child with no symptoms of infection and an otherwise normal CSF profile often is ignored, but may be the critical laboratory finding in the diagnosis of a rare disorder called glucose transporter protein syndrome (GLUT1 deficiency syndrome), which has a deficiency of the enzyme necessary for the transport of glucose into the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].
