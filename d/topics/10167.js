Cardiac involvement occurs during the early disseminated phase of the disease, usually within weeks to a few months after the onset of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The most common clinical feature of Lyme carditis is atrioventricular (AV) conduction block related to dysfunction of the conduction system, but may also include decreased cardiac contractility due to myopericarditis.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of Lyme carditis will be reviewed here. Other manifestations of Lyme disease are discussed separately.

Earlier studies reported carditis in approximately four to ten percent of untreated adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/1,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-6</a>]. This difference is likely due to the widespread recognition and treatment of early Lyme disease. As an example, four percent of patients developed carditis with evidence of AV nodal block in a prospective study of patients with erythema migrans who did not receive antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Europe, carditis has been reported as a complication of Lyme disease in approximately 0.3 to 4.0 percent of untreated adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Some authors have suggested that the incidence of carditis may be lower in Europe compared with the United States. However, given the possible overestimate of clinically significant cardiac manifestations in the United States described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], the incidence of Lyme carditis may be similar in both regions. </p><p/><p>The rate of carditis in children is not known. In a prospective study that included 14 children with proven Lyme disease in the United States who had electrocardiograms, two patients had first degree atrioventricular block, one had left axis deviation, and one had ventricular ectopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There is a strong male predominance of approximately 3:1 in cardiac Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], compared with only a slight predominance of Lyme disease overall among males (53 percent) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Appropriate antibiotic therapy for erythema migrans or other features of early localized Lyme disease prevents subsequent Lyme disease, including cardiac manifestations of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1784285547\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because biopsies of the heart are rarely performed and because Lyme carditis is not typically fatal, limited information is available regarding the pathophysiology of Lyme carditis in humans. Animal studies in both monkeys and mice have shown that inflammation can be seen transmurally. Inflammation typically has a predominance of macrophages and lymphocytes, which is in distinction to Lyme arthritis, where there is a heavier infiltration of neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although inflammation can affect multiple areas of the heart, in mice the heaviest areas of infiltration include the connective tissue at the base of the heart, the basal interventricular septum, and perivascular regions including the aortic adventitia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>In humans with fatal pancarditis, diffuse infiltrates affecting multiple areas of the heart have been seen. In a case report, infiltrates were particularly prominent in perivascular areas and in the interstitial regions, similar to the findings in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is unknown what type of pathology and localization occurs in less severe cases or during earlier stages of infection in humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardiac features of early disseminated Lyme disease typically occur one to two months (range &lt;1 to 28 weeks) after the onset of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Cardiac disease can be the only feature of infection or can occur together with other features of early Lyme disease, such as erythema migrans or early neurologic symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with cardiac involvement may be asymptomatic or complain of lightheadedness, syncope, shortness of breath, palpitations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest pain. Sudden cardiac death attributable to Lyme disease has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>In a surveillance study of Lyme disease cases in the United States, 875 patients had sufficient data on possible cardiac manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cardiac manifestations were present in 84 patients (10 percent), 20 percent of whom were hospitalized. The following manifestations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations &mdash; 58 patients (6.6 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conduction abnormalities &mdash; 16 patients (1.8 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocarditis &mdash; 8 patients (0.9 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular failure &mdash; 4 patients (0.5 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericarditis &mdash; 2 patients (0.2 percent)</p><p/><p>It is important to note that palpitations can be a nonspecific finding, and therefore may not represent carditis. Cardiomyopathy has not been observed in patients with Lyme carditis in the United States, but has been reported rarely in patients in Europe. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Chronic cardiomyopathy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrioventricular (AV) conduction block of varying severity is the most common objective manifestation of Lyme carditis. The degree of AV block can fluctuate rapidly, with first degree AV block progressing to second degree or complete AV block and sometimes back to first degree AV block over a matter of minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a review of 52 patients with Lyme carditis, 87 percent had AV block; 54 percent had complete or high-grade AV block, which was usually symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Another review of 105 patients with Lyme carditis in Europe and North America found similar numbers, with complete AV block in 49 percent, second degree AV block in 16 percent, and first degree AV block in 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The highest risk for progression to complete AV block, which may develop rapidly, occurs in patients with a PR interval greater than 300 milliseconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As would be anticipated, patients with higher degrees of AV block are more likely to be symptomatic. In one report, all 10 patients with high-grade AV block were symptomatic with syncope, dizziness, dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contrast, only two of eight patients with first degree AV block had cardiac symptoms, which consisted only of palpitations. </p><p>Electrophysiological studies have usually found conduction delay occurring above the bundle of His, often within the AV node. However, heart block can occur at different levels within the conducting system. Sinoatrial node dysfunction (manifested as SA nodal block), abnormal nodal recovery time, intraatrial block, and fascicular and bundle branch block have all been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/6,9,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,19-22</a>]. Some patients have variable bundle branch blocks, suggesting multifocal damage in the His-Purkinje system or AV node, whereas others have brief episodes of asystole due to transient failure of an escape rhythm.</p><p>AV block caused by Lyme disease has been reported to persist for 3 to 42 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/2,19,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19,22,23</a>]. Complete AV block typically improves to lesser degrees of AV block within one week, and more minor conduction disturbances usually resolve within six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. </p><p>The different types of AV block are discussed in detail separately.

A mild pericardial effusion may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In most cases, it is asymptomatic and clinically inapparent. The most frequent manifestation of myocardial involvement in Lyme disease is nonspecific ST and T wave changes on the electrocardiogram. However, occasional patients develop symptomatic myocarditis with cardiac muscle dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Sudden cardiac death has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Myocardial biopsy and autopsy specimens have shown a band-like lymphoid and plasmacytic interstitial infiltrate, variable amounts of myocyte necrosis, fibrosis, and edema, and occasional endarteritis obliterans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/19,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26-29</a>]. In some cases, spirochetal forms have been found in or near the cellular infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], or were grown from biopsy material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>]. There are no documented patients with valvular damage or aortitis caused by <em>B. burgdorferi</em>.</p><p>Gallium and anti-myosin indium scans have been abnormal in individual cases, but no systematic or prospective studies of the usefulness of these nonspecific tests have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Europe, scattered case reports and small case series have suggested that <em>B. burgdorferi</em> may be a cause of chronic cardiomyopathy in patients with no history of symptomatic Lyme disease. In contrast, cardiomyopathy has not been observed in patients with Lyme carditis in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The following reports from Europe describe the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case report described a patient with chronic congestive cardiomyopathy who was strongly seropositive for anti-<em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Myocardial biopsy revealed spirochetal forms and <em>B. burgdorferi</em> was grown from these specimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, <em>B. burgdorferi</em> was grown from their myocardial biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Cardiac function returned to normal in both patients following treatment with IV penicillin in addition to standard medications used for heart failure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 42 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, nine were seropositive for anti-<em>B. burgdorferi</em> antibodies and were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>: six recovered fully, two had a partial response, and one showed no improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Lyme carditis is established by the presence of consistent epidemiologic and clinical features in conjunction with positive results of Lyme serologic testing. It is important to establish the diagnosis of Lyme disease not only so that antibiotics can be administered, but also to avoid placement of a permanent pacemaker in those with severe conduction disturbances; the atrioventricular block associated with Lyme carditis is usually short-lived and can be managed with a temporary pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Telemetry and pacemakers'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful history should address risk factors or possible evidence of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection. These include prior exposure (residence in or travel through an endemic area), previous tick bites, prior or current erythema migrans lesion(s), and coexistence of neurologic dysfunction compatible with neurologic Lyme disease. The first reported series describing 20 patients with Lyme carditis found the following associated features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema migrans in 15 (75 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint involvement in 13 (65 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningoencephalitis (some with concurrent facial nerve palsy or radiculoneuritis) in seven (35 percent)</p><p/><p>Diagnosis of Lyme carditis is more difficult in patients whose only observed manifestation of Lyme disease is carditis and in those who had only a preceding non-specific febrile illness. In cases of isolated carditis, diagnosis relies on serologic testing in patients with a moderate to high pretest probability of Lyme disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmatory Western blot analysis should reveal seropositivity for Lyme disease in patients with Lyme carditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. As with the use of serologic testing for other manifestations of Lyme disease, serologic test results alter the likelihood that a patient has Lyme disease, but do not establish the diagnosis alone. Test results need to be interpreted in light of the pre-test probability that the patient has Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following factors should be kept in mind when obtaining these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If IgM positivity is found, it is likely that the infection is recent and that <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is the etiologic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, IgM reactivity, both by ELISA and Western blot, is subject to higher rates of false positivity than IgG tests. In addition, the IgM response may persist for years in patients with prior Lyme disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because Lyme carditis is a manifestation of the disseminated stage and typically occurs one to two months after the initial infection, the vast majority of patients have positive serologic responses (either IgM or IgG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, patients with a negative serologic test are very unlikely to have Lyme carditis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Up to 5 percent of the population in Lyme disease-endemic areas is seropositive by ELISA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38</a>]. As a result, a positive ELISA result does <strong>not</strong> confirm the diagnosis of Lyme carditis; all positive or equivocal ELISA results should be corroborated by a Western blot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum antibody levels may persist long after cure of Lyme disease. Thus, even IgM seropositivity may be related to a prior episode of Lyme disease, rather than recent infection, and the current cardiac disease may not be causally related to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection. Likewise, persistence of serologic reactivity after an episode of cardiomyopathy does not represent ongoing infection, nor does it suggest a need for prolonged therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Lyme carditis are treated to prevent later complications of Lyme disease and to shorten the duration of the cardiac manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Because of the potential for life-threatening complications, patients who are symptomatic (eg, syncope, dyspnea, or chest pain), have second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, or have first degree AV block with a markedly prolonged PR interval (&ge;300 milliseconds) should be hospitalized, monitored with cardiac telemetry, and treated with intravenous antibiotics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59949 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lyme-carditis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No comparative trials have been performed to identify the optimal antibiotic regimen for Lyme carditis or to confirm that outcomes are improved with initial treatment with intravenous antibiotics compared with oral antibiotics.

In addition, all patients had positive serologic findings for early disseminated infection.

Cardiac involvement occurs during the early disseminated phase of the disease, usually within weeks to a few months after infection. The most common clinical feature of Lyme carditis is atrioventricular (AV) conduction block related to dysfunction of the conduction system, but may also include decreased cardiac contractility due to myopericarditis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cardiac features of Lyme disease typically occur one to two months (range &lt;1 to 28 weeks) after the onset of infection. Cardiac disease can be the only feature of infection or can occur together with other features of early Lyme disease, such as erythema migrans or early neurologic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cardiac involvement may be asymptomatic or complain of lightheadedness, syncope, shortness of breath, palpitations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest pain. Sudden cardiac death attributable to Lyme disease has also been reported. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Varying degrees of AV block are the most common manifestation of Lyme carditis. The degree of AV block can fluctuate rapidly, with first degree AV block progressing to second degree or complete AV block and sometimes back to first degree AV block over a matter of minutes. The highest risk for progression to complete AV block occurs in patients with a PR interval greater than 300 milliseconds. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of Lyme carditis is established by the presence of clinical features in conjunction with positive results of Lyme serologic testing. An ELISA and Western blot analysis should reveal seropositivity for Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with early disseminated disease and carditis who are symptomatic, have second or third degree AV block, or have first degree AV block with a prolonged PR interval (&ge;300 msec) should be admitted to the hospital for monitoring with cardiac telemetry and consideration of a temporary pacemaker. We recommend that all patients who require hospital admission be treated with IV antibiotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> rather than oral antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). IV antibiotics should be continued until high-degree heart block has resolved and the PR interval has become less than 300 milliseconds; the patient may then be switched to oral therapy to complete a 21 to 28 day course (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59949 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that asymptomatic patients with early disseminated disease and first-degree AV block with a PR interval &lt;300 milliseconds who are not admitted to the hospital be treated initially with oral therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59949 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The total duration of therapy for such patients is 21 days. We suggest that patients who are admitted to the hospital for cardiac monitoring be treated initially with IV antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Such patients should be switched to an oral regimen prior to or at the time of hospital discharge. (See <a href=\"#H89979907\" class=\"local\">'Oral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate oral antibiotics include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> axetil, although doxycycline should <strong>not</strong> be used in children &lt;8 years of age or in pregnant women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59949 \">table 1</a>).
