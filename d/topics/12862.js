In addition, advances in immunosuppression and immune monitoring have led to a commensurate decrease in immunological graft losses. However, pancreas allograft rejection remains a major clinical challenge and is the primary cause of death-censored pancreas allograft loss after three months posttransplant.</p><p>At present, approximately three-quarters of pancreas transplants in the United States are performed as simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplants, with the remainder performed as either sequential pancreas after kidney transplant (PAK, 16 percent) or pancreas transplants alone (PTA, 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of acute rejection of the pancreas allograft in the setting of SPK transplantation. However, this discussion is also applicable to pancreas allograft rejection in PAK and PTA recipients.</p><p>The selection of patients, induction, and maintenance immunosuppressive therapies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient selection for and immunologic issues relating to kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefits and complications (other than rejection) associated with these procedures and the roles of PTA and islet transplantation in diabetic patients without renal failure are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and complications associated with kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreas and islet transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2364934853\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall incidence of acute rejection among patients receiving a pancreas transplant ranges from 15 to 21 percent at one year to 27 to 30 percent at five years depending upon donor and recipient ethnicity, pretransplant panel reactive antibody (PRA) level (80 percent of patients have a PRA of &lt;20 percent), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching, and immunosuppressive regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, acute rejection rates vary depending upon the number of prior transplants and what type of pancreas transplant is performed. As an example, recipients of a simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant experience lower overall rates of acute rejection compared with those receiving either a pancreas after kidney transplant (PAK) or a pancreas transplant alone (PTA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for acute rejection include undergoing a nonprimary SPK transplant or a solitary pancreas transplant, race or HLA mismatch, transplantation involving a male donor and female recipient, increasing donor age, and a PRA level of &gt;40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/2,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5</a>]. Among recipients of a PTA, the number of HLA mismatches, particularly at the HLA-B and HLA-DR loci, also increases the risk of acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The development of de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) posttransplant may also be a risk factor for pancreas rejection and graft failure. In one study of 150 SPK transplant recipients who had DSAs measured at 3, 6, and 12 months posttransplant and then yearly thereafter, the incidence of de novo DSA detection was 15 percent at a median of three years posttransplant. Risk factors for the development of de novo DSAs included pretransplant allosensitization, full HLA-DR mismatch, and previous episode of acute T cell-mediated rejection. Forty percent of patients with de novo DSAs experienced acute rejection in any graft (23 percent in the pancreas) compared with 9 percent of those without de novo DSAs detected. Death-censored pancreas allograft survival was significantly reduced (47 versus 89 percent) at eight years in the presence of DSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other observational studies have reported mixed results about the association of de novo DSAs with either graft rejection or failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1912498495\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1312137268\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with pancreas allograft rejection are asymptomatic, although some occasionally present with mild graft tenderness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever. Because the pancreas allograft is intra-abdominal in location, and because graft tenderness is usually secondary to allograft pancreatitis, other clinical manifestations of acute rejection include abdominal pain, distension (typically caused by ileus), or a change in bowel function. However, the primary means of monitoring patients for allograft rejection is laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"#H1916046231\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory monitoring for allograft rejection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1916046231\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory monitoring for allograft rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among pancreas transplant recipients, we perform the following tests to monitor for allograft rejection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of serum lipase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of serum amylase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of fasting plasma glucose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of serum creatinine (in simultaneous pancreas-kidney [SPK] transplant recipients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of hemoglobin A1C</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of fasting serum C-peptide</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of amylase in a timed (8- to 12-hour) urine collection (only in pancreas recipients with bladder drainage)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of whole blood <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>) concentration</p><p/><p>Some but not all transplant centers instruct patients to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) levels to monitor for allograft rejection.</p><p>Additionally, some centers may monitor donor-specific antibody (DSA) levels at specified time points (eg, at 4 and 12 months posttransplant), depending upon the immunological risk. As noted above, de novo detection of DSA may be associated with a higher risk of acute rejection. (See <a href=\"#H2364934853\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Among pancreas allograft recipients whose primary disease was type 1 diabetes, some transplant centers monitor anti-insulin, anti-islet cell, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies to evaluate for recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. We do not perform these tests as routine monitoring for allograft rejection but perform them in patients who present with endocrine dysfunction of the allograft (eg, hyperglycemia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prediction of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Islet autoantibodies'</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of laboratory monitoring depends upon the time since transplantation and may vary among different transplant centers. In the immediate posttransplant period, lab monitoring is performed on a daily basis. From the time of discharge until three months posttransplant, labs are usually monitored once or twice per week. Between three and six months posttransplant, laboratory monitoring may occur every one to two weeks. Between 6 and 12 months, labs are checked every two to four weeks. After one year posttransplant, we monitor labs on a monthly basis in the absence of a clinical event. However, in the presence of a major clinical event at any point in time posttransplant, the frequency of lab monitoring is usually increased over the short term.</p><p>We do <strong>not </strong>perform surveillance pancreas biopsies for routine monitoring of allograft rejection. However, given the difficulty in detecting pancreas allograft rejection by clinical features and laboratory monitoring, some transplant centers perform surveillance pancreas biopsies at specified time points (eg, 1, 3, 6, or 12 months posttransplant). The role of pancreas allograft biopsy is discussed below.

However, acute rejection may not be the primary cause of allograft pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In our experience, an elevated serum lipase is more sensitive and specific for parenchymal graft injury than an elevated serum amylase level. However, the overall specificity of these lab tests is relatively low (50 percent) as other factors can contribute to abnormal pancreatic enzyme elevation. Consequently, imaging studies (pancreas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> kidney ultrasonography in SPK transplant recipients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen and pelvis) may be indicated to rule out other causes of allograft pancreatitis (eg, peripancreatic fluid collection, infection, exocrine leak, bowel obstruction). Chronic rejection and graft failure can also occur in patients without significant elevations in pancreatic enzyme levels. (See <a href=\"#H295111780\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Among SPK transplant recipients, a 60 percent concordance of pancreas and kidney rejection allows for monitoring of kidney function as a surrogate for pancreas rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, an elevated serum creatinine may be a marker of subclinical pancreas allograft rejection. However, isolated pancreas rejection can occur in the setting of normal renal allograft function and histopathology in 20 percent of cases, and, conversely, isolated kidney rejection can occur in the setting of normal pancreas allograft function and histopathology in 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, a stable or normal serum creatinine level in SPK transplant recipients does not necessarily exclude the possibility of pancreas allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, an elevated serum creatinine level may also reflect nonimmunologic causes of renal impairment.</p><p>The presence of fasting hyperglycemia or an elevated hemoglobin A1C level (ie, &gt;7 percent) is usually a late finding of acute rejection as early rejection usually affects exocrine tissue (ductitis and acinar inflammation) and the vasculature (venulitis and arteritis) before islet cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Hyperglycemia, when it coincides with elevated serum lipase and amylase levels, is more specific for acute rejection and may portend significant graft destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, hyperglycemia or an increase in hemoglobin A1C level without elevated pancreatic enzyme levels is nonspecific and can be caused by an increase in insulin resistance due to significant weight gain, recurrence of autoimmune type 1 diabetes, or posttransplant diabetes secondary to medications. In addition, measurement of hemoglobin A1C levels may be affected by a decline in renal function or anemia.</p><p>Fasting C-peptide levels, similar to HbA1c levels, are not particularly useful in the diagnosis of acute rejection but may be more predictive of chronic graft injury and graft longevity. There is evidence that stimulated or provocative glucose and C-peptide testing may be of some benefit in identifying both acute and chronic graft injury, but the cumbersome nature of this testing limits its clinical utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>De novo DSA or rising DSA levels should prompt an evaluation for acute rejection and an allograft biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H2364934853\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>In SPK transplant recipients with bladder drainage, a decrease in urinary amylase level (measured as international units per hour) is suggestive of early rejection. In general, acute rejection should be suspected in patients who present with either a decrease in urinary amylase level of 25 percent or more from baseline on two consecutive measurements obtained at least 12 hours apart or a decrease of 50 percent or more from baseline on any single measurement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2564512931\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to the diagnosis of pancreas allograft rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In pancreas transplant recipients suspected of having pancreas allograft rejection (see <a href=\"#H3802020018\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect pancreas allograft rejection'</a> above), we usually advocate inpatient admission for evaluation and management.

In selected patients with normal renal function, we administer intravenous (IV) contrast at the time of the CT scan to better delineate the pancreas anatomy; such patients should receive measures to help prevent the development of contrast-induced nephropathy.

If serum lipase and amylase levels normalize with the reduction in immunosuppression, pancreas allograft rejection is unlikely, and the pancreatic enzyme elevation can be attributed to the toxicity of tacrolimus (or cyclosporine) at supratherapeutic levels.

Biopsy of the pancreas allograft can also reveal other causes of pancreatic inflammation and injury, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) pancreatitis and other viral infections, acute pancreatitis secondary to chemicals or other etiologies, and tumor infiltration in the setting of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

Complications occurred in 2.8 percent of biopsies and included bleeding and inadvertent biopsy of the kidney, liver, or small bowel. Other experienced transplant centers have similarly reported high rates of diagnostic adequacy and low complication rates with ultrasound-guided biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A CT-guided biopsy, or, rarely, an open or laparoscopic surgical biopsy, is an alternative option when a biopsy cannot be safely performed with ultrasound guidance.</p><p>Among patients who have a pancreas allograft with either enteric or bladder drainage, the duodenal segment of the allograft is an alternative site to obtain tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the potential of discordant findings between pancreas and duodenal histology and the difficulty in accessing the allograft duodenum in patients with enteric drainage have limited its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Venulitis (subendothelial inflammatory cells in septal veins) is part of the histologic finding of acute cellular rejection in pancreas allografts (whereas, in kidney transplantation, venulitis is not included in the grading score). Septal inflammation by itself does not meet the criteria for grade I acute cellular rejection; therefore, it is considered borderline for cellular rejection. Acute cellular rejection is classified into three grades according to the severity of inflammation and the degree of involvement of vascular endothelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F110708\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110708 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreas-allograft-rejection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I (mild) &ndash; Active septal inflammation with evidence of inflammation in another component (septal veins, ducts, nerve branches, or focal acinar).

In addition, the benefits of treatment (eg, restoration of allograft function) must be weighed against the risks of antirejection therapy (eg, worsening of hyperglycemia, infection, malignancy). Assessment of pancreatic function is based upon evaluation of the patient's fasting plasma glucose concentration, serum C-peptide, and hemoglobin A1c levels. A normal fasting plasma glucose, normal serum C-peptide, and hemoglobin A1c of &lt;7 percent confirm a functioning pancreas allograft, whereas an elevated fasting plasma glucose, a low or undetectable serum C-peptide, or a hemoglobin A1c level of &gt;7 percent is suggestive of abnormal islet allograft function. The chronicity of allograft injury is determined by the pancreas allograft biopsy and imaging of the pancreas allograft. Evidence of significant fibrosis or a reduction in pancreatic islets on biopsy, or the finding of a small-sized pancreas allograft by imaging, is consistent with a chronic component to the rejection.</p><p>In general, we treat nearly all patients who have evidence of acute rejection on biopsy irrespective of the perceived chronicity of allograft injury or degree of graft dysfunction. Because exocrine immunological injury usually occurs before islet injury, extensive parenchymal fibrosis and severe allograft dysfunction are not contraindications to treatment in the setting of biopsy-proven acute rejection. In addition, failure to treat acute rejection may lead to an intra-abdominal catastrophe or further sensitization. However, in patients with clinical evidence of allograft endocrine dysfunction (eg, elevated fasting serum glucose, low serum C-peptide, or hemoglobin A1c level &gt;7 percent) <strong>and </strong>histologic evidence of a reduction in pancreatic islets, some authorities would not treat for acute rejection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3860991803\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with biopsy-proven rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our recommendations for the treatment of pancreas allograft rejection are based upon the clinical experience of the authors and editors and existing data relevant to both kidney (alone) and pancreas transplantation.

Our regimen consists of pulse IV glucocorticoids followed by rATG-Thymoglobulin in the absence of a clinical response. In general, however, we prefer not to administer rATG in the absence of biopsy corroboration of the diagnosis of acute rejection.

However, the primary means of monitoring patients for allograft rejection is laboratory testing.

If the renal allograft biopsy demonstrates evidence of acute rejection in an SPK transplant recipient, we treat these patients for acute rejection without proceeding to pancreas biopsy.

However, in patients with clinical evidence of abnormal allograft function (eg, elevated fasting plasma glucose, low serum C-peptide, or hemoglobin A1c level &gt;7 percent) <strong>and </strong>histologic evidence of a reduction in pancreatic islets, some authorities would not treat for acute rejection. The treatment of acute rejection depends upon the type and severity of rejection seen on biopsy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with acute cellular rejection, we target therapy according to the degree of inflammation per the Banff classification:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In patients with borderline acute cellular rejection, we augment maintenance immunosuppression for the ensuing two to three months.

We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> as premedication prior to the first two to three doses of rATG-Thymoglobulin, followed by a tapered dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. We do not administer pulse high-dose glucocorticoids in patients who receive rATG-Thymoglobulin. In addition, we augment maintenance immunosuppression.

We empirically treat patients for acute cellular rejection if the likelihood of acute rejection is judged to be high. In addition, we also treat for antibody-mediated rejection if there is a detection of de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) or an increase in DSA compared with pretransplant levels in the setting of graft dysfunction.
