Basic life support (BLS) involves a systematic approach to initial patient assessment, activation of emergency medical services, and the initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), including defibrillation. Key components of effective CPR include adequate ventilation and chest compressions.</p><p>BLS can be performed by trained laypersons, as well as by health care providers. This topic will review BLS principles for health care providers. Basic airway management for children, neonatal resuscitation, and BLS for adults is discussed separately.

Causes of respiratory failure and shock leading to cardiopulmonary arrest in these age groups include trauma, sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory distress, and sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/1,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-8</a>]. This is in contrast to adults, for whom the most common cause of cardiac arrest is ischemic cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and survival'</a>.) </p><p>Survival following pediatric cardiac arrest varies according to the site of arrest: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Out-of-hospital arrest</strong> &ndash; Out-of-hospital pediatric arrests often occur at or near home and are frequently unwitnessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Based upon observational studies, survival to discharge is approximately 3 to 10 percent for infants younger than one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/6,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10</a>] and 9 to 19 percent for children 1 to 18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>] with the higher rates of survival found in patients of all ages who received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Increased survival with favorable neurologic outcome occurs in pediatric patients who receive early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after a witnessed arrest, undergo public access defibrillation, and have an initial cardiac arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/1,10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs in up to 18 percent of all pediatric prehospital cardiac arrests, but is less commonly the presenting rhythm in younger children between the ages of one and eight years (8 percent) and infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. Predisposing conditions or causes of ventricular rhythms in pediatric patients with pulseless arrest include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anomalous coronary artery (from the pulmonary artery), long QT syndrome, myocarditis, drug intoxication (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">digoxin</a>, cocaine), and commotio cordis (ie, sharp blow to chest). (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>In-hospital arrest</strong> &ndash; Among children with in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest, acute resuscitation survival approaches 78 percent and survival to discharge occurs in 39 to 65 percent of patients who receive CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. As an example, in one multicenter observational study of 1031 children with in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrests occurring in academic pediatric hospitals over a 10-year period (2000 to 2009), adjusted survival to discharge increased from 14 to 43 percent while the rates of significant neurologic disability remained stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This improvement in survival occurred despite a high prevalence of asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) found as the initial arrest rhythm (up to 85 percent of patients) and was similar regardless of the initial cardiac arrest rhythm (ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole or PEA) although improved adjusted survival was seen in patients with an initial rhythm of pulseless VT or pulseless electrical activity when compared to asystole (risk ratio [RR] 1.6 and 1.2, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during resuscitation and postresuscitation care (ECPR) significantly increased from 8 to 14 percent of patients during the study but was <strong>not</strong> associated with overall survival to discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a separate retrospective observational study of over 2200 United States children younger than 18 years of age with in-hospital cardiac arrest reported to a centralized registry from 2000 to 2014, tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest was associated with a significantly lower adjusted survival to hospital discharge compared to a propensity matched cohort of patients who were not intubated (36 versus 41 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There was no significant difference in return of spontaneous circulation or favorable neurologic outcome between the groups. Although confounding cannot be fully excluded given the study design, this evidence suggests that the emphasis on early tracheal intubation during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest warrants re-examination and further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, rates of survival from cardiopulmonary arrest are higher for in-hospital pediatric cardiopulmonary arrests than for out-of-hospital arrests and improved survival among children with in-hospital arrests cannot be attributed to differences in initial cardiac arrest rhythm or ability to perform ECPR. </p><p>By contrast, if promptly treated, children with a respiratory arrest are much more likely to recover than those with a cardiopulmonary arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/1,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23</a>]. As an example, in an observational study of 95 children with out-of-hospital arrest, 82 percent of children with respiratory arrest were alive at one year compared with 14 percent of patients with a cardiopulmonary arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, the best outcomes in critically ill children occur if cardiac arrest is avoided altogether.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERNATIONAL RESUSCITATION GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon extensive review of clinical and laboratory evidence, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) published updated guidelines for pediatric basic life support (BLS) in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] and a treatment recommendations summary in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For the purposes of these guidelines, a newborn is defined as from birth to hospital discharge, an infant is younger than one year of age, and a child is from one year to the start of puberty (axillary hair in males and breast development in females).</p><p>The approved international BLS algorithms are available <a href=\"https://eccguidelines.heart.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BLS-Pediatric-Cardiac-Arrest-Single-Rescuer-Algorithm.png&amp;token=QiXfRhq4NGj0dCrobWyHysqZLJ7ET8DocrgQBX74VJj3/smbK24akkrWM+a4rssUpah3gAtov4TVMzQd3Y4If7nNt2DAjf/BvZ2dq9qxbc2MX9mYuE9fKlSCMaC9ERpGvtCjrlkGyVfNnoZORHm0RA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6384\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">here</a> (single rescuer) and <a href=\"https://eccguidelines.heart.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BLS-Pediatric-Cardiac-Arrest-2-or-More-Rescuers-Algorithm.png&amp;token=Ew5/mWJjhpHour+DZE+zq9tu1dP9qhEBddIKT243lxI7P5VQN0WQsY8SnCwF0wnrk7LQJ02TyEUtBX/NEjO+GkIXaaC5mD6Dj7jZeLDHTcEC8vSKRsjKzik9AUA6xinyOdXoiEaFeJDGsBaYj0BvyQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6384\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">here</a> (two or more rescuers).</p><p>The 2015 guidelines reaffirm that the circulation-airway-breathing (C-A-B) sequence is still preferred for pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Based upon the 2017 ILCOR treatment summary, conventional CPR has better outcomes than compression-only CPR in some children and is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>The sequence for neonatal resuscitation is described separately.

Evidence in adults and animals suggest that these are the essential elements for effective chest compressions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p>Chest compressions should be performed over the lower half of the sternum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/24,25,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,32</a>]. Compression of the xiphoid process can cause trauma to the liver, spleen, or stomach, and must be avoided. The effectiveness of compressions can be maximized by attention to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chest should be depressed at least one-third of its anterior-posterior diameter with each compression (approximately 4 cm [1.5 inches] in most infants and 5 cm [2 inches] in most children).

Each compression and decompression phase should be of equal duration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of a metronome is associated with a higher achievement of the optimal rate of compressions. As an example, in a crossover trial of 155 medical personnel (medical students, pediatric residents and fellows, and pediatric nurses) who performed compressions on a pediatric manikin with or without a metronome, compressions occurred at the recommended rate significantly more often when a metronome was used (72 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
