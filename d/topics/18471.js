With the worldwide eradication of smallpox, routine vaccination with vaccinia virus is no longer performed. However, after the anthrax bioterrorism attack in October 2001, there was a debate about the advisability of reinitiating routine vaccination against smallpox [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Even prior to the potential need to revaccinate an at-risk population due to concerns about bioterrorism with smallpox, vaccinia virus has remained important to understand because of its widespread use as an expression vector in research laboratories and because of its potential use as a vector for recombinant vaccines or as an oncolytic agent. In addition, the military continues to routinely vaccinate recruits against smallpox.</p><p>Infectious diseases clinicians may see patients with complications from smallpox vaccination or be asked about the advisability of vaccination for occupational exposure to vaccinia virus or other orthopoxviruses. Since routine vaccination was stopped in the United States in the 1970s, current decisions about vaccination are now made when there are an ever-expanding number of students and researchers who are working with vaccinia virus who were never vaccinated as children.</p><p>Issues related to vaccinia virus in the research setting will be reviewed here. Vaccinia virus as the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=smallpox-vaccine-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">smallpox vaccine</a> to prevent smallpox is discussed separately.

This approach is similar to policies that allow healthcare workers to decline recommended vaccines that confer protection against substantially more dangerous or contagious infections. An example of such documentation can be found at the University of Pennsylvania Office of Environmental Health and Safety web site: <a href=\"http://www.ehrs.upenn.edu/protocols/vaccinia.html&amp;token=YcTrwovA3d41Io3ZW1ndxV680JC2yFljNWHhxl52oVNkm4qY/J+xa6Wd304ENhXmQYAYOwAKsyJ3ik26RnOBYQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=8324\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.ehrs.upenn.edu/protocols/vaccinia.html</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PROS AND CONS OF VACCINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pros and cons of vaccinating all research workers who work with vaccinia virus is discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/3,9,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,11-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Arguments for vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the years there have been a number of published case reports of laboratory accidents involving vaccinia virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. From 2005 to 2007, five cases of laboratory-acquired vaccinia virus infection were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during informal consultations regarding management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Two patients had no history of prior vaccination, one refused immunization, and another did not have follow-up for a failed vaccination. Of note, all the cases reported were from accidental needle sticks. Because there is no official national surveillance system for the reporting of laboratory accidents, the extent of the problem is unknown.</p><p>Supporters of immunization stress that vaccination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provides exposure to a measured (rather than unknown) dose of a well-characterized virus formulation, which results in local infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>May prevent an uncontrolled infection with unknown pathogenicity after an accidental exposure in the laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the specific circumstance when a researcher is working with vaccinia virus expressing HIV proteins, vaccination with vaccinia virus may protect the researcher from unintentional seroconversion to HIV antigens after an accidental exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Arguments against vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On the other hand, many argue that the risks outweigh the theoretical benefits of routine vaccination of all workers in the post-smallpox era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/4,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,8</a>]. The arguments against vaccination include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If one uses proper and careful microbiological techniques similar to those used when handling other viruses like HIV or HSV, there should not be accidental exposures when working with vaccinia virus. If the worker uses appropriate precautions, the hazard is a personal one and not significant for co-workers, family, or the public health, and thus, the question of vaccination should be an individual decision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks of complications from intentional vaccination are greater than the chance of an accidental exposure potentially causing a problem. In addition, there is a potential risk of spread of the virus after vaccination to the ever-growing group of unvaccinated contacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not certain that vaccination will prevent an infection caused by a laboratory accident since there is evidence of what appears to be a primary infection in some previously vaccinated people. Most of the known complications of vaccination can also occur during revaccination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccination may give a false reassurance of protection to the worker. The presence of neutralizing vaccinia virus antibody may not prevent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is theoretically possible that vaccination with the current vaccine might prevent a later immune response to a recombinant vaccinia virus-based vaccine. Previously vaccinated workers might make anti-vaccinia immune responses that could negate a superior response to the foreign antigen expressed by a recombinant vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many do not like the permanent scar that develops at the vaccination site. Also, if generalized vaccinia occurs there is a risk of the development of disfiguring scars on other parts of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF EXPOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of exposure is influenced by the work environment, work-related procedures, and the virulence of the laboratory vaccinia virus strain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Work environment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing a potentially dangerous protein should be performed in a biosafety level 3 containment facility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Work-related procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occupational health and safety offices that provide the vaccine at academic and industrial centers should inquire about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What will the researcher be doing with the vaccinia virus and what titer stocks will be used?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is important to know the circumstances of the vaccinia use, since work with animals, or sharps, or high titer virus stocks increase the possibility of an accidental exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What antigen will the recombinant vaccinia virus express? Will any foreign genes be inserted into the vaccinia virus that may increase virulence?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory strains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to realize that the majority of work done with vaccinia virus in the laboratory setting is done with the laboratory adapted vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve (WR). This strain was selected for its neurovirulence in mice and is more pathogenic in the mouse model than the human vaccine strain, ACAM2000. While the preponderance of recombinant viruses used in the research setting have foreign genes inserted into the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of laboratory strain WR, which significantly attenuates the virus in animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], it is not clear if these viruses are attenuated in humans. For example, when these TK-negative viruses are given to humans by scarification, the same sized lesions are produced as the TK-positive vaccine strain, suggesting that virulence in humans is comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/11,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TARGET GROUPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is highly recommended that the following researchers should be vaccinated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those exposed to monkeypox or to high titer vaccinia virus (that is, an accidental exposure with a droplet would produce an infectious dose)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those directly working with needles while vaccinating animals with recombinant vaccinia viruses (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory strains'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those working with vaccinia viruses that may have enhanced virulence</p><p/><p>Informed consent for vaccination describing the relative benefits and risks should be obtained from any worker receiving the vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR ADVERSE EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should also remember that there is a higher risk of serious adverse reactions after exposure to vaccinia virus in people with the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with immunodeficiencies (natural, acquired, or drug-induced)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with a history of eczema, atopic dermatitis, or other exfoliative skin condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cardiac disease</p><p/><p>Individuals in the research setting with these contraindications should not receive vaccinia vaccine. Individuals with contraindications to vaccination should probably consider not working with vaccinia virus or other human orthopoxviruses.</p><p>Relative contraindications to vaccination would be close contact of the vaccinee with people who have any of the above-mentioned conditions, although this is debatable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccinia-virus-as-the-smallpox-vaccine#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccinia virus as the smallpox vaccine&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR VACCINE RESEARCH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Route of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since one of the major complications of smallpox vaccination is the inadvertent spread of the virus from the vaccinee to unvaccinated contacts, there had been some research into administering a sterile vaccine intradermally or intramuscularly in hopes of decreasing some of the complications due to cutaneous administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, one study demonstrated that either of these routes of administration induced lower immune responses than standard scarification. While this is disappointing, it is also not known what level of immune response is needed to safeguard against serious infection after accidental exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Attenuated virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Germany, a highly attenuated vaccinia virus (ie, Modified Vaccinia Ankara, MVA) was used to vaccinate 100,000 people during the smallpox eradication program in the 1970s. This vaccine, which was given subcutaneously or intramuscularly, rather than through scarification, was not associated with any significant adverse events. This viral strain is now being used for the development of recombinant vaccinia virus based vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccinia-virus-in-the-research-setting/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], as well as for biodefense purposes.

With the worldwide eradication of smallpox, routine vaccination with vaccinia virus is no longer performed.
