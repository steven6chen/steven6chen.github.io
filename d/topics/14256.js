Among nearly 7000 returned travelers with fever seen at a GeoSentinel clinic between 1997 and 2006, for example, malaria was the most common specific etiologic diagnosis, found in 21 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The relative risk of malaria is higher among returned travelers from sub-Saharan Africa than those from Asia or the Americas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>There were 1724 cases of imported malaria reported in 2014 to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. More than half of the reported cases are due to <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>, which causes the most severe disease; patients with <em>P. falciparum</em> may progress to life-threatening illness within hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Since 1997, there has been an average of six malaria deaths per year in the United States.</p><p>Prevention efforts should be aimed at all forms of malaria. In addition to <em>P. falciparum</em>, other <em>Plasmodium</em> species that cause human malaria include <em>P. vivax</em>, <em>P. ovale</em>, <em>P. malariae</em>, and <em>P. knowlesi</em>. While <em>P. falciparum</em> is most likely to result in severe disease, all malaria species can cause severe disease and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In general, most chemoprophylaxis regimens are designed to prevent primary attacks of malaria. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Primaquine</a> can also prevent relapses of malaria caused by <em>P. vivax</em> and <em>P. ovale</em>. (See <a href=\"#H62154113\" class=\"local\">'Drug mechanisms'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Primaquine'</a> below.)</p><p>Most travelers who develop malaria do so because they do not adhere to an effective chemoprophylactic drug regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

VFRs pose unique challenges for malaria prevention since their acquired immunity afforded some degree of protection against malaria while they resided in the endemic area, although such immunity wanes outside endemic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Prevention measures include avoiding mosquito bites and adhering to antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. However, travelers should also understand that no chemoprophylaxis regimen guarantees complete protection and that fever during or after travel is a medical emergency requiring urgent medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other symptoms may include headache, myalgia, cough, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

In such cases, the chemoprophylactic regimen should be continued together with treatment offered locally, unless there are significant drug-drug interactions (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefloquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefloquine</a> with halofantrine). If the initial evaluation demonstrates negative blood films, thick and thin blood films or rapid diagnostics should be repeated twice (12 to 24 hours apart).</p><p>Pregnant women are an important risk group, as malaria can be a life-threatening infection for both mother and fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Approximately 1500 cases of imported malaria are reported annually to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); more than half of these are due to <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk assessment for malaria requires detailed review of the planned itinerary together with the most recent CDC guidelines and advisories. An excellent summary of areas with malaria transmission and prophylaxis by country is available on the <a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever-and-malaria-information-by-country.htm&amp;token=617CpJoLv1Ixt/HnnE0cHFEzkEoV5DZ48vvYG5EJxDIehY1IyHUy7+fd0+Gr2Rr34RhEPpAooleK8VOGIjmb00bV70P9m1ButgfaN4f//3zYbFA7Rs2G3MWfIJ596OhxmO2UsRG2K1yxwiNCI4gVEjjdWGVjnFrS3rjrYT4OsbA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5722\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC website</a>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Destination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk groups also include travelers born in regions with endemic malaria who relocate outside the endemic area but subsequently return to visit friends and relatives (VFRs), pregnant women, and military personnel. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Type of traveler'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travelers to malarious areas should be counseled regarding mosquito bite prevention and adherence to antimalarial chemoprophylaxis if indicated. However, travelers also understand that no chemoprophylaxis regimen guarantees complete protection; fever during or after travel is a medical emergency requiring urgent medical attention. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travelers should receive instructions regarding methods to prevent bites from <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes, including avoiding outdoor exposure between dusk and dawn, wearing clothing that reduces the amount of exposed skin, wearing insect repellant (eg, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide [DEET] or picaridin), staying in well-screened or air-conditioned rooms, and sleeping within bed nets treated with insecticide (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">permethrin</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Mosquito bite prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend chemoprophylaxis for patients at risk of malaria infection because of travel to destinations with malaria transmission (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Because of variation in malaria transmission and antimalarial drug resistance, individual itineraries should be reviewed together with the most recent CDC guidelines and advisories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75761\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75761 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54777\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54777 \">table 2</a>).

Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primaquine</a> for presumptive antirelapse therapy is appropriate for travelers to regions where there is substantial transmission of <em>P. vivax</em> or <em>P. ovale</em>, even if <em>P. falciparum</em> is the predominant endemic species. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Relapse prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women traveling to malarious areas are increased risk for life-threatening infection and adverse outcomes for both mother and fetus. Pregnant travelers should be advised to defer travel until after delivery whenever feasible. Chemoprophylaxis in the setting of pregnancy is discussed above.
