Both are associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), have similar features on renal histology (eg, a focal necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis), and have similar outcomes. There are, however, several differences between these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H11698538\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with GPA and MPA are treated with initial immunosuppressive therapy (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, most commonly in association with glucocorticoids) to induce remission. This is followed by maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, or rituximab to sustain the remission. Although most patients respond to these measures, relapses can occur.</p><p>Despite the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy, some patients have appreciable morbidity, and some patients die from the disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adverse effects of drug therapy. In addition, some patients develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require renal replacement therapy with dialysis or renal transplantation.</p><p>The prognosis in patients with GPA and MPA, as well as the management of patients who develop ESRD, will be reviewed in this topic. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of these disorders, initial and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, and the management of cyclophosphamide-resistant or relapsing disease are discussed separately.

One cause of the increase in mortality was infection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Importance of infection'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients who survive are frequently left with severe morbidity. As an example, the consequences of irreversible organ damage and of prolonged (often more than one year) therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and glucocorticoids were evaluated in an initial 1992 study from the National Institutes of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis-and-management-of-those-who-develop-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this early study, 86 percent of patients had serious morbidity that was due to irreversible vasculitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> side effects of treatment. The principal adverse nonfatal outcomes included glucocorticoid toxicity, an increased risk of malignancy (2.4-fold overall and 33-fold [5.6 percent incidence] for bladder cancer), amenorrhea lasting more than one year (57 percent) or an inability to become pregnant, and progressive organ failure. Another study reported the long-term follow-up of 302 surviving patients with GPA or MPA who had been enrolled in various treatment trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis-and-management-of-those-who-develop-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; at seven years, 91 percent of patients had at least one sign of permanent vasculitis-associated damage. As examples, 19 percent had peripheral neuropathy, 14 percent had ESRD, 12 percent had impaired pulmonary function, and 12 percent had malignancy. A significant proportion had multiple morbidities, including 34 percent who had at least five signs of permanent morbidity.

The standardized incidence rate among patients with GPA compared with the expected rate in the general population was 2 for all cancers (approximately two new cancers per 100 patient-years of follow-up), 4.8 for bladder cancer (all 14 cases occurred in patients over age 50 years), 7.3 for squamous skin cancer, 5.7 for leukemia, and 4.2 for lymphoma. One caveat with these findings is that the patients were seen between 1969 and 1994, and it is possible that the current cancer rate is lower given the shorter cyclophosphamide induction regimens now in use.

Patients with GPA and MPA are treated with initial immunosuppressive therapy (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) to induce remission.

Despite the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy, some patients have appreciable morbidity, and some patients die from the disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adverse effects of drug therapy. In addition, some patients develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require renal replacement therapy with dialysis or renal transplantation.

In comparison, different treatment studies have reported mortality rates ranging from 12 to 28 percent at 7 to 8 years to 24 to 44 percent at 4 to 10 years. The major causes of death in patients with GPA and MPA are complications from immunosuppressive therapy (primarily infection), complications from the underlying disease (eg, renal failure, pulmonary failure), and cardiovascular disease.

The principal determinants of a poor renal outcome include more severe renal dysfunction at presentation, lack of response to initial treatment, renal relapses, age greater than 65 years, and prominent fibrotic changes, such as interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis on initial renal biopsy.
