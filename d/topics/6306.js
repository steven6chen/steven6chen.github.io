HL has a unique cellular composition, containing a minority of neoplastic cells (Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants) in an inflammatory background. It is separated from the other B cell lymphomas based on its unique clinicopathologic features, and can be divided into two major sub-groups, based on the appearance and immunophenotype of the tumor cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76591\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76591 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classical HL &ndash; The tumor cells in this group are derived from germinal center B cells, but typically fail to express many of the genes and gene products that define normal germinal center B cells. Based on differences in the appearance of the tumor cells and the composition of the reactive background, classical HL is further divided into the following subtypes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nodular sclerosis classical HL (NSHL)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mixed cellularity classical HL (MCHL)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lymphocyte rich classical HL (LRHL)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lymphocyte depleted classical HL (LDHL)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodular lymphocyte predominant HL &ndash; The tumor cells in this subtype retain the immunophenotypic features of germinal center B cells.

This amounts to approximately 8500 new cases and about 1120 deaths due to HL in the United States annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence in Europe is approximately 2.4 cases per 100,000 persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>HL has a bimodal age distribution curve. The pattern of age-specific incidence differs by geographic location and appears to parallel the level of industrial development:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the US and other economically advantaged countries, there is one peak in young adults (approximately age 20 years) and one in adults of older age (approximately age 65 years); the majority of patients are young adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62585\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62585 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is a slight male predominance, especially in children and in middle and older adulthood. The incidence pattern may vary by race. In one population-based study, the peak incidence was in young adulthood among Whites, Blacks, and <span class=\"nowrap\">Asians/Pacific</span> Islanders and in older individuals among Hispanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In economically disadvantaged areas, there is an initial peak in childhood for boys, relatively low rates in young adults, and a late peak in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intermediate pattern with peaks of incidence both in childhood and in the second decade of life has been described in early industrialized or transitional economies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Variance in histologic subtype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predominant histologic subtype also differs by geographic location and economic advancement. In developed countries such as the US, nodular sclerosis HL (NSHL) is the predominant histologic subtype and accounts for most disease in young adults. In economically disadvantaged areas, mixed cellularity HL (MCHL) is more frequent in children and older adults. Early industrialized or transitional economies tend to have roughly equal frequencies of the MCHL and NSHL subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>In the US and Europe, the approximate percentage of classic HL cases from each subgroup are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodular sclerosis classical HL (70 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed cellularity classical HL (20 to 25 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphocyte rich classical HL (5 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphocyte depleted classical HL (less than 1 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Socioeconomic status and the environment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In economically advantaged countries, the risk of developing HL as a young adult is consistently associated with factors indicative of a high standard of living in early childhood, including single family housing and small family size. These associations appear to be specific for the nodular sclerosis subtype of HL and for disease occurring from early childhood through middle adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In comparison, the risk pattern for the mixed cellularity HL (MCHL) subtype is inversely related to socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among lower socioeconomic groups in economically advantaged populations, cases of HL are predominantly of MCHL and lymphocyte depleted HL (LDHL) subtypes, and are more frequently Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>These data associating socioeconomic status with the risk of HL are generally taken to suggest that the development of HL is related to the delayed exposure (exposure at an older age) to a common environmental or infectious agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. The specific exposure that is important is not clear. The following are observations regarding potential exposures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There appears to be an increased risk of HL in patients with a history of infectious mononucleosis caused by EBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].

Several studies have shown a possible association with human herpesvirus 6, although the contribution to the pathogenesis of HL is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A protective effect of breastfeeding has been shown in multiple studies, but it is not known if this is due to transmitted maternal antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from population-based case-control studies have raised the possibility that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use may protect against the development of HL and that smoking may increase the risk of HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of HL is increased in a number of settings associated with immunodeficiency, including solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation, therapy with immunosuppressive drugs (eg, in patients with autoimmune disease), and HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. As an example, among patients infected with HIV, the relative risk of HL is increased in various studies from fivefold to 25-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>].</p><p>Of note, the increase in risk for HL in immunosuppressed populations is less striking than that for non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) and the timing of HL and NHL development also differs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>]. As an example, the peak incidence of HL is four or more years after solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation, in contrast to NHL, which most commonly occurs in the first year after transplantation. In addition, NHL is primarily associated with marked immunosuppression, while patients with near-normal CD4 counts and no evidence of overt immunosuppression may develop HL. Almost all HL cases occurring in the setting of HIV infection are EBV-positive and many belong to the otherwise rare lymphocyte-depletion subtype. Given that T cell immunity is essential to hold EBV-transformed cells in check, these associations suggest that HIV-induced immunosuppression is at least partly responsible for the increased incidence of HL in HIV infected individuals.

Despite compelling molecular evidence that Reed-Sternberg cells are derived from germinal center or post-germinal center B cells, these cells typically fail to express a number of transcription factors that are found in normal germinal center B cells and other malignancies derived from these cells, such as follicular lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>In classical HL, the Reed-Sternberg cells typically express CD15 (85 percent of cases) and CD30 (virtually 100 percent of cases), and usually lack global expression of pan-B (CD19, CD20, CD79a) and pan-T (CD3, CD7) antigens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73875%7EHEME%2F54023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73875 graphicRef54023 \">picture 14A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. However, approximately 95 percent of cases are weakly positive for <span class=\"nowrap\">PAX-5/BSAP,</span> a transcription factor that is a master regulator of B cell development. In addition, many cases of classical HL have B cell antigen expression (CD20 more often than CD79a) on a proportion of the Reed-Sternberg cells; B cell antigen expression is typically variable in intensity and not present in all cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Among classical forms of HL, CD20 expression is most frequently seen in the lymphocyte-rich HL subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/64,65,70,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65,70,73</a>]. Expression of a single T cell antigen, such as CD4, may occasionally be seen on Reed-Sternberg cells, but classical HL expressing multiple T cell antigens is rare; such tumors usually prove to be T cell lymphomas. HL cases that express T cell antigens have inferior rates of event-free and overall survival when compared with T cell antigen negative tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>In addition to CD15 and CD30, Reed-Sternberg cells express CD25, HLA-DR, ICAM-1, Fascin, CD95 <span class=\"nowrap\">(apo-1/fas),</span> TRAF1, and both CD40 and CD86; the latter are molecules associated with B cell activation and T cell interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/71,72,75-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72,75-79</a>].

Reed-Sternberg cells of classical HL also often express PD-L1 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PD-L2, ligands for the PD-1 receptor. Activation of PD-1 leads to &quot;exhaustion&quot; and inactivation of effector T cells and is believed to have an important role in immunoevasion of Reed-Sternberg cells from the host immune system, providing a rationale for treatment of patients with inhibitors of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PD-L1/PD-1</span> signaling axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>In contrast to NLPHL, the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical HL often lack the nuclear BCL-6 protein associated with follicle center B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>], and may express CD138, a plasma cell associated antigen. In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive cases, the tumor cells express EBV latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 but not Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)-2. Low-level expression of <span class=\"nowrap\">PAX-5/BSAP,</span> seen in most cases, is helpful in distinguishing classical HL from unusual T cell lymphomas.

Although the proximal cause of this alteration in gene expression is not yet understood, it is apparent that the expression and activity of many B cell specific &quot;master&quot; transcription factors is altered in classical Reed-Sternberg cells. For example, the B cell-specific transcription factors Pu.1, Oct-2, and BOB1, which drive Ig expression, are usually decreased or undetectable, whereas certain factors that are expressed in T cells, such as Notch1, are increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Assessment of Oct-2 and BOB1 can be useful in distinguishing classical HL from NLPHL or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in difficult cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57079 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].

Finally, although <span class=\"nowrap\">PAX-5/BSAP</span> is expressed in classical Reed-Sternberg cells, its ability to activate target gene expression is abrogated, possibly because of its co-dependence on other transcription factors that are lost.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic features</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Ig and TCR gene rearrangements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to detect immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements differs depending upon the technique used. In studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to analyze total nodal DNA isolated from cases of classical HL, rearrangements of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and TCR genes are usually not detected. With more sensitive PCR techniques using single Reed Sternberg cells micromanipulated from frozen tissue sections, several groups documented the presence of clonal, somatically mutated VDJ rearrangements in most cases of classical HL, a molecular finding that indicates an origin from germinal center or post-germinal center B cells.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immunophenotype can help to distinguish PMBL from HL most cases. In classical HL, the neoplastic Reed-Sternberg cells typically express CD15 and CD30, few if any B cell antigens (typically on only a subset of cells), and lack pan-T cell antigens. In contrast, PMBL cells typically express pan-B cell antigens, have weak expression of CD30, and only rarely express CD15. In addition, in EBV-negative cases, the expression of fascin in Reed-Sternberg cells can help distinguish classical HL from DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p>There are occasional cases that combine features of PMBL and HL. Such cases are labeled &quot;B cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.&quot;</p><p>In addition, HL must be differentiated from T cell histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma (THRLBCL). THRLBCL occurs most commonly in middle-aged males. As in HL, the tumor cells often comprise a minor fraction of the total cellularity. Distinction from HL is usually not difficult, as the malignant B cells in THRLBCL usually have an immunophenotype similar to typical DLBCL (eg, positive for pan-B cell markers and negative for CD15, CD30, and EBV).
