There is a long list of causes of microscopic hematuria, most of which are benign, especially in children with isolated asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. The challenge that faces the clinician is to identify the child in whom hematuria is caused by significant underlying disease and avoid unnecessary testing in those individuals with a benign condition.</p><p>The etiology and evaluation of microscopic hematuria in children will be reviewed here. The evaluation of children with gross hematuria is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of gross hematuria in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DETECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematuria is defined by the presence of an increased number of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine. Hematuria can either be visible to the naked eye (gross) or apparent only upon urinalysis (microscopic). Microscopic hematuria may be discovered as an incidental finding on an urinalysis prompted by urinary or other symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary dipstick</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common screening test for hematuria is the urinary dipstick test for blood. Dipsticks for hemoglobin are as sensitive as the urine sediment examination, but result in more false-positive tests. In comparison, false-negative dipstick tests are unusual; as a result, a negative dipstick reliably excludes abnormal hematuria.</p><p>The reagent strip that detects blood utilizes hydrogen peroxide, which catalyzes a chemical reaction between hemoglobin (or myoglobin) and the chromogen tetramethylbenzidine. Different shades of blue-green are produced according to the concentration of hemoglobin in the urine sample. These strips can detect 5 to 10 intact <span class=\"nowrap\">RBCs/microL,</span> which roughly corresponds to a finding on microscopic examination of two to five RBCs per high-power field from the sediment of a centrifuged 10 to 15 mL urine sample.</p><p>False-negative results can occur in the presence of formalin (used in preservatives) or high urinary concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). False-positive results may occur with alkaline urine (ie, pH greater than 9) or contamination with oxidizing agents used to clean the perineum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscopic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive dipstick for hematuria is confirmed by a microscopic examination of the sediment of 10 to 15 mL of centrifuged fresh urine. Microscopic hematuria is defined as the presence of more than five RBCs per high-power field (40x magnification) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-microscopic-hematuria-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The microscopic examination is the gold standard for the detection of microscopic hematuria. </p><p>The procedures for obtaining and processing urine samples in children are reviewed separately.

The identification of the glomeruli as the source of blood is important both prognostically and to optimize the subsequent diagnostic evaluation.</p><p>Signs of glomerular bleeding in children with microscopic hematuria include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65786\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65786 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red cell casts (pathognomonic for glomerular disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55778\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55778 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein excretion greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> at a time when there is no gross bleeding.

The presence of more than 30 percent dysmorphic RBCs or of more than 5 percent of a specific form named an &quot;acanthocyte&quot; is highly suggestive of glomerular hematuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79440%7ENEPH%2F62064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79440 graphicRef62064 \">picture 2A-B</a>).

Patients often have persistent microscopic hematuria with episodes of gross hematuria that is precipitated by an upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal illness. There is typically a negative family history of renal disease.

Heterozygous carrier-females also can have hematuria, but do not usually have progressive renal disease. The genetic abnormality in these patients involves the gene for the alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen (<em>COL4A5</em>). In addition, there are autosomal recessive and dominant forms of Alport syndrome with mutations in the <em>COL4A3</em> and <em>COL4A4</em> genes.

In many cases, TBM is the heterozygous form of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome involving the <em>COL4A3</em> or <em>COL4A4</em> genes; two abnormal genes are required for the Alport phenotype. However, linkage with the <em>COL4A3</em> or <em>COL4A4</em> genes has not been found in all families with TBM.</p><p>Children with TBM usually have a family history of hematuria and no history of progressive renal disease. Often, the diagnosis is made in affected children when hematuria is detected in a first degree family member during evaluation.
