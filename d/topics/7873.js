Hyperthyroidism is the most common feature of Graves' disease, affecting nearly all patients, and is caused by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin)-receptor antibodies (TRAb) that activate the receptor, thereby stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion as well as thyroid growth (causing a diffuse goiter). The presence of TRAb in serum and orbitopathy on clinical examination distinguish the disorder from other causes of hyperthyroidism.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of treatment options for Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults. The pathogenesis of Graves' disease, the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, other causes of an overactive thyroid gland, as well as treatment of Graves' disease in pregnant women and children are reviewed in more detail in separate topic reviews. The treatment of hyperthyroidism due to other etiologies is reviewed in the individual topics.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Graves' disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Graves' disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27895232\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic approach to Graves' hyperthyroidism consists of both rapid amelioration of symptoms with a beta blocker and measures aimed at decreasing thyroid hormone synthesis: the administration of a thionamide, radioiodine ablation, or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The approach outlined below is consistent with Hyperthyroidism Management Guidelines from the American Thyroid Association (ATA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A beta blocker should be started (assuming there are no contraindications to its use) in most patients as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made, even before confirming that the cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. We usually give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> (25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> which has the advantages of single daily dosing and beta-1 selectivity; however, all beta-adrenergic blocking drugs effectively diminish hyperthyroid symptoms. Beta blockers ameliorate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism that are caused by increased beta-adrenergic tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These include palpitations, tachycardia, tremulousness, anxiety, and heat intolerance. Fatigability and shortness of breath were also improved in patients who were treated with a beta blocker and a thionamide versus a thionamide alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2638690\"><span class=\"h2\">Decrease thyroid hormone synthesis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1095594915\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three treatment options for Graves' disease: antithyroid drugs (thionamides), radioiodine, or surgery. All three options are effective, but all three options have significant side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67833 \">table 1</a>). Because there is no consensus as to the &quot;best&quot; treatment, the ATA guidelines emphasize the importance of fully discussing the options with patients and considering their values and preferences before deciding on a treatment plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].</p><p>Additionally, the three options are not mutually exclusive. Antithyroid drugs may be used initially to control hyperthyroidism prior to definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery, they may be prescribed for one to two years to try and attain a remission, or they may be used long term. Radioiodine may be given as initial therapy or after pretreatment with antithyroid drugs, and surgery is usually preceded by antithyroid drugs to attain a euthyroid state preoperatively.</p><p>There are few trials comparing therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the only randomized trial comparing all three therapies, each was equally effective in normalizing serum thyroid hormone concentrations within six weeks; after treatment, 95 percent or more of the patients were satisfied with their therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In addition, most patients reported that they would recommend the therapy to a friend without reservation (medical: 68 percent; surgical: 74 percent; radioiodine: 84 percent). The risk of relapse was 37, 21, and 6 percent in the thionamide, radioiodine, and surgery groups, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1085652933\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with significant symptoms of hyperthyroidism, or patients with a significant risk of hyperthyroid complications (eg, older age, cardiovascular disease), we suggest starting a thionamide (in addition to beta blockers) to achieve euthyroidism quickly. This can be followed by ablative therapy with radioiodine or surgery, by continuation of a thionamide for one to two years with the hope of attaining a remission, or by more prolonged treatment with a thionamide.</p><p>Radioiodine can be used as initial therapy (without thionamide pretreatment) in patients who are tolerating hyperthyroid symptoms and who are not at risk for complications.</p><p>Individual patient factors may influence the choice of therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild hyperthyroidism, minimal thyroid enlargement, and no orbitopathy, radioiodine (without thionamide pretreatment or glucocorticoids) or a one- to two-year course of thionamides are good options.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild hyperthyroidism, minimal thyroid enlargement, and mild orbitopathy, radioiodine (with glucocorticoid coverage but without thionamide pretreatment) or a one- to two-year course of thionamides are good options.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with more severe hyperthyroidism, we suggest definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery, but a one- to two-year course of thionamides or long-term thionamide therapy are both reasonable alternatives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with moderate to severe orbitopathy, we prefer surgery rather than radioiodine with glucocorticoid coverage for definitive therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioiodine is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation and should be discouraged or prohibited in patients who cannot follow radiation precautions (eg, sole caregivers for infants or young children, or incontinent older adult patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery may be the best option for patients with large goiters and patients with suspicious nodules or hyperparathyroidism but may be a poor option for patients who are older, at high surgical risk, or without access to high-volume thyroid surgeons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antithyroid drugs are contraindicated in patients with prior adverse reactions (agranulocytosis or hepatitis). Because they are teratogenic, their long-term use in women desiring a pregnancy in the next year or two requires a careful discussion of their risks and alternative treatments, such as definitive therapy prior to conception. Their long-term use may be preferred in older adult patients with contraindications to surgery and radioiodine or in patients who want to avoid definitive therapy.</p><p/><p>Over half of clinicians in the United States still prefer radioiodine while approximately 40 percent will begin with a one- to two-year course of antithyroid drugs. In contrast, radioiodine is unpopular in Europe and Asia, with over 80 percent of European clinicians choosing antithyroid drugs and only 14 percent choosing radioiodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The popularity of antithyroid drugs may be increasing in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The choice of therapy should involve the values and preferences of the patient.</p><p>The individual therapies are discussed briefly below and in more detail in the individual topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Thionamides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with significant symptoms of hyperthyroidism, we suggest starting a thionamide (in addition to beta blockers) to achieve euthyroidism relatively quickly, prior to more definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery. The goal of thionamide therapy in Graves' hyperthyroidism is to attain a euthyroid state within three to eight weeks. This can be followed by ablative therapy with radioiodine or surgery, by continuation of the drug for one to two years with the hope of attaining a remission, or for long-term therapy.</p><p>Antithyroid drugs will control hyperthyroidism in most patients as long as the drug is taken, but remission rates (the percentage of patients who remain euthyroid one year after the drug is withdrawn) average under 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Remission is more likely in patients with mild hyperthyroidism and patients with small goiters or with goiters that shrink during thionamide therapy. Thus, primary antithyroid drug therapy may be preferred for patients with mild disease and small goiters, who are more likely to achieve remission after one year of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease#H3925582570\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Predictors of remission'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pretreatment evaluation</strong> &ndash; Prior to initiating thionamides, we obtain baseline blood tests, including a complete blood count (white count with differential) and a liver profile (bilirubin and transaminases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We do not use thionamides in patients with a baseline absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or elevated liver transaminases (more than fivefold the upper limit of normal) except in selected patients after careful assessment of alternatives and risks.

Methimazole is now almost exclusively used because of its longer duration of action, allowing for once daily dosing, more rapid efficacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54732\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54732 \">figure 1</a>), and lower incidence of side effects. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propylthiouracil</a> (PTU) is preferred during the first trimester of pregnancy, because of the more significant teratogenic effects of methimazole, and in patients who have minor drug reactions to methimazole who refuse radioiodine or surgery.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and toxicity of thionamides&quot;, section on 'Toxicities and their management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Radioiodine ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radioiodine is less expensive and has a lower complication rate than surgery and is preferred as definitive therapy of hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant patients except in patients with moderate or severe orbitopathy. For patients with significant symptoms of hyperthyroidism, who are older, or who have underlying heart disease or other comorbidities, we treat with a thionamide (in addition to beta blockers) to restore euthyroidism prior to radioiodine treatment. For patients with mild, well-tolerated hyperthyroidism, there is no need to pretreat with a thionamide, and radioiodine can be given soon after the diagnosis is made. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism#H30632329\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment with methimazole'</a>.)</p><p>If radioiodine is chosen, the patient must be comfortable with the decision to ablate the thyroid and be aware that prolonged thionamide therapy lasting even decades is an acceptable alternative as long as the drug is tolerated and the hyperthyroidism is controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Clinicians and patients must also be aware that there is increasing evidence that radioiodine therapy can cause the development or worsening of Graves' orbitopathy more often than antithyroid drug therapy or surgery. The changes are often mild and transient, at least in patients who have mild or no orbitopathy before therapy. The ATA guidelines do not recommend radioiodine for patients with moderate to severe orbitopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but radioiodine with glucocorticoid coverage is a possible option for such patients who refuse surgery and have contraindications to antithyroid drugs.

Radioiodine induces extensive tissue damage, resulting in ablation of the thyroid within 6 to 18 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients fail the first radioiodine treatment and require a second or subsequent dose. These patients usually have more severe hyperthyroidism or larger goiters. A discussion on dosing and side effects, including hypothyroidism, can be found elsewhere.

It is primarily indicated in patients who have an obstructive goiter or a very large goiter; in patients with moderate to severe, active orbitopathy who desire definitive therapy for their hyperthyroidism; in pregnant women who are allergic to antithyroid drugs; and in patients who have allergies or poor compliance on antithyroid drugs but refuse radioiodine. Surgery would also be indicated if there was a coexisting suspicious or malignant thyroid nodule or primary hyperparathyroidism. However, most thyroid nodules associated with Graves' disease are benign, in which case surgery would not be recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Graves' disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The therapeutic approach to Graves' hyperthyroidism consists of both rapid amelioration of symptoms with a beta blocker and measures aimed at decreasing thyroid hormone synthesis with the administration of a thionamide, radioiodine ablation, or surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67833 \">table 1</a>). The choice of therapy should involve active discussion between clinician and patient; it may also be determined by the severity of the patient's hyperthyroidism.
