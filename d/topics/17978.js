The sound may be a buzzing, ringing, or hissing, although it can also sound like other noises.</p><p>Tinnitus is most commonly associated with hearing loss, though it may be a presenting symptom of vascular or neurological abnormalities. Once a serious underlying medical condition has been ruled out, treatment should be directed at the symptom itself, which severely interferes with the quality of life in approximately 10 percent of patients with tinnitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of tinnitus. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of tinnitus are discussed separately.

For many patients, tinnitus is a chronic condition; goals of treatment are to lessen its impact and any associated disability, rather than to achieve absolute cure. Several treatment modalities have been studied, including behavioral treatments and medications, but the benefit for most of these interventions has not been conclusively demonstrated in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. A comparative effectiveness study on treatment for tinnitus for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that research is limited by the lack of data regarding measures to assess patients, and poorly collected data regarding adverse effects of a variety of interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to initiating therapy for tinnitus, it is important to address other associated conditions that can exacerbate tinnitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with depression require appropriate treatment. In a randomized trial, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a> 100 mg, compared to placebo, resulted in overall benefit for patients with disabling tinnitus (67 percent versus 40 percent), though tinnitus severity was insignificantly improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Suicidality may be increased in patients with tinnitus, but a cause and effect relationship is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A meta-analysis of six randomized trials of antidepressants for treatment of tinnitus (four evaluating tricyclic antidepressants, one using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> initiated at 10 mg daily, one studying <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a>) found evidence inconclusive for the effectiveness of antidepressants in this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There was a suggestion of tinnitus improvement in a patient subgroup that received higher doses of paroxetine (50 mg) in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but this requires further evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Insomnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with tinnitus who have insomnia should be treated for their sleep disorder with the goal of reducing the severity of tinnitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

As examples, a bruit from an AVM, dural AVE, or dehiscent jugular bulb may be treated by ligation or embolization, and glomus tumors can be treated by angiographic embolization and surgical resection.</p><p>Reassurance for patients with venous hums or benign arterial variants causing pulsatile tinnitus may be helpful and is usually adequate. Rarely, surgical or angiographic ligation of the offending vessel is indicated for patients whose pulsatile tinnitus is so loud that it cannot be adequately treated with masking or other noninvasive treatment strategies and who experience significant impairment in their quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Presbycusis and other hearing loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hearing aids in patients with presbycusis usually result in an improvement in tinnitus symptoms.</p><p>Patients with conductive hearing loss due to outer ear or middle ear disease may benefit from surgery to correct the conductive defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53903 \">table 1</a>). These patients may also derive some benefit from hearing aids if surgery is not an option.</p><p>Cochlear implantation is a well-accepted therapy in adults and children with severe hearing impairment who are not benefiting from hearing aids. Electrical stimulation of the auditory pathway is associated with a loss or reduction of tinnitus in 34 to 93 percent of patients receiving cochlear implants, although some individuals develop tinnitus postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

Investigational therapies aimed at protecting the inner ear from trauma (noise induced damage) will likely also reduce the incidence of tinnitus seen with such damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic and hormone imbalances, if present, should be corrected and may result in resolution of the tinnitus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with myoclonus of the palatal muscles or middle ear structures, treatment with botulinum toxin injections into the palate or sectioning of the tendons with the middle ear usually relieves the symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patulous Eustachian tube can be treated with a variety of agents, including application of mucosal irritants (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>) to the nasopharynx, which result in swelling or scarring of the Eustachian tube orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. If these treatments fail, surgery may be successful with placement of silicone plugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] through the middle ear, or various endoscopic techniques to close the nasopharyngeal orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of behavioral treatments have been studied with some success:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biofeedback and stress reduction programs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</p><p/><p>Multidisciplinary programs at tinnitus centers are available to assist patients with disabling tinnitus. A randomized trial, performed in an audiological referral center, compared a multidisciplinary stepped therapy approach (incorporating TRT and CBT, and involving clinical psychologists, movement therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists, social workers, and audiologists) to usual care for 492 adult patients with tinnitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. At 12 months, patients assigned to the stepped therapy had significant improvement in scores reflecting health-related quality of life, tinnitus impairment, and tinnitus severity. </p><p>Above all, patients should not be discouraged or advised that there are no treatment options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Tinnitus retraining therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinnitus retraining therapies (TRT) are based upon bypassing or overriding abnormal auditory cortex neural connections. These therapies are performed at specialized tinnitus centers and in some audiologic practices; techniques vary among practitioners and each center has its own specific rates of success.</p><p>TRT is based on the principle that all levels of the auditory pathways and several nonauditory systems play essential roles in tinnitus; TRT enhances the role of nonauditory systems in determining the level of tinnitus annoyance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. TRT involves inducing and facilitating habituation to the tinnitus signal. The goal is to reach a stage in which patients are unaware of their tinnitus unless they specifically and consciously focus on it. Furthermore, even when perceived, tinnitus does not evoke annoyance. Habituation is achieved by directive counseling combined with low-level, broad-band noise generated by wearable generators, and environmental sounds, according to a specific protocol.</p><p>Significant improvement has been reported in as many as 80 percent of patients with high-pitched tinnitus using TRT with combined counseling and noise generators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. The long-term impact may be less reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. TRT can take one to two years before the patient no longer needs the external device.</p><p>In a systematic review that included only one randomized trial of 123 participants with tinnitus, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) was more effective than tinnitus masking in improving symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Biofeedback and stress reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biofeedback is a relaxation technique that teaches people to control certain autonomic body functions. The goal of biofeedback is to help people manage tinnitus-related distress by changing the patient's reaction to it. Many people notice a reduction in tinnitus when they are able to modify their reaction to it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Biofeedback was first described as a stand-alone therapy for complex tinnitus in the 1980s and continues to be used as part of a battery of therapy options at many tinnitus centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an intervention aimed at motivating patients to learn to alter their psychological response to their tinnitus by identifying and reinforcing coping strategies, distraction skills, and relaxation techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. CBT requires patients to keep diaries and to perform homework. In a meta-analysis of ten randomized trials evaluating different forms of CBT (by therapists and over the internet), CBT improved tinnitus symptoms compared to non-CBT controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Self-help books have also been shown to benefit patients with troubling or disabling tinnitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Some patients report decrease in tinnitus with use of such devices, although there is no conclusive evidence from randomized trials to clarify the evidence of effectiveness. One systematic review of six randomized trials found significant risk of bias and differences in outcome measures and evaluation techniques that precluded a definitive assessment of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Masking can also produce the phenomenon of residual inhibition, where the reduction or elimination of tinnitus perception continues for a short time after the masker is removed. One therapy under evaluation, phase-shift treatment, aims to enhance residual inhibition that results from masking. Similar to the concept used in sound cancellation headphones, phase shift therapy uses a sound wave that is phase-shifted 180 degrees from the patient's endogenous sound wave. Residual inhibition lasting one hour to seven days was reported in 42 percent of patients during active phase-shift treatment for two weeks, and in no patients during nontreatment control weeks, in a crossover study (n = 61) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits of phase-shift treatment prior to clinical use.</p><p>Potential adverse effects of masking therapy include worsening of tinnitus, associated discomfort, or worsening hyperacusis. </p><p>For patients with tinnitus related to hearing loss, the use of an appropriately fitted hearing aid may act to mask the tinnitus. As with other masking strategies, the tinnitus tends to return some time after the hearing aid is removed. In a randomized trial comparing hearing aid use with a sound generator for tinnitus associated with hearing loss, both interventions had comparable benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p>Masking may also be accomplished using or enhancing ambient background noise.

Transcutaneous electrical stimulation is the only available electrical option that is not associated with a risk of causing hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Electrical stimulation may be provided either through a single electrode or via multiply placed acupuncture needles over the mastoids or around the auricle.</p><p>In patients without hearing loss, however, electrical stimulation external to the middle or inner ear has not been demonstrated to be more effective for tinnitus suppression than placebo treatment; responses were approximately 38 to 43 percent for both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>Case reports of increasingly invasive procedures have been published including electrodes placement directly into a site in Heschl's gyrus that was mapped to respond to the tone of the perceived tinnitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-tinnitus/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].
