Care of patients with chronic HCV infection depends upon recognition of those at increased risk for side effects, anticipation (and prevention) of side effects, and appropriate response when they occur. Furthermore, the ability to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) to therapy depends in part upon the degree of compliance with therapy. Reduction of the dose of these agents (or their discontinuation) due to side effects can potentially compromise the outcome, depending upon when dose reduction occurs.</p><p>Although treatment paradigms for chronic hepatitis C are rapidly evolving, peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>, typically in combination with a direct-acting antiviral, remain in use for certain genotypes, particularly in resource-limited settings where newer interferon-free regimens are inaccessible or unavailable.

As an example, the presence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis increases the likelihood of developing anemia during therapy with a peginterferon and ribavirin-containing regimen. Additionally, it is important to emphasize that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> is renally excreted and may accumulate to dangerously toxic levels in patients with impaired renal function. Ribavirin should be completely avoided in patients on dialysis or with moderate to severe renal insufficiency. Even among patients with renal function in the normal range, a lower baseline creatinine clearance has been associated with the development of anemia while on peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy with or without a protease inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-side-effects-of-peginterferon-and-ribavirin-used-for-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Host genetic factors also appear to contribute to the hemolysis seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-side-effects-of-peginterferon-and-ribavirin-used-for-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A genome-wide association study identified polymorphisms in a region of chromosome 20 that were associated with a decreased risk of ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-side-effects-of-peginterferon-and-ribavirin-used-for-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These polymorphisms were associated with decreased functionality of inosine triphosphatase (ITPA). ITPA hydrolyzes inosine triphosphate (ITP) and deoxyinosine triphosphate, and defects in the enzyme lead to ITP accumulation within the cell. It is postulated that the accumulated ITP competes with the triphosphate active form of ribavirin in an unknown cellular processes, protecting cells from the lytic effects of ribavirin-triphosphate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1289564309\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of anemia is multifactorial, with contribution from both ribavirin-induced hemolysis and interferon&rsquo;s suppression of erythropoiesis and the normal compensatory bone marrow response, which is evidenced by an inadequate reticulocyte response to anemia. Interferon has also been associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Warm agglutinins and drugs&quot;, section on 'AIHA after interferon'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins#H4051470694\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic anemia due to drugs and toxins&quot;, section on 'AIHA after interferon'</a>).

Ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia is dose dependent, stabilizes with dose reduction, and resolves upon discontinuation. The exact mechanism is unclear. Ribavirin is concentrated within erythrocytes and results in a relative deficiency of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) within red blood cells and, therefore, an increased susceptibility to oxidative damage and extravascular hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-side-effects-of-peginterferon-and-ribavirin-used-for-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].
