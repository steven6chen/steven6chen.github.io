The use of combinations of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is typically required in patients with persistently active disease, defined as RA of at least six months&rsquo; duration which remains active despite initial treatment with one or several DMARDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>DMARDs are divided into two broad major categories, nonbiologic and biologic, and a third category of drugs with some features of each of the major types.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nonbiologic DMARDs are traditional small-molecule or synthetic DMARDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The biologic DMARDs, produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology, usually target specific cytokines or their receptors, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, or IL-6 receptors. Other types of biologic DMARDs include B-cell depleting agents and T-cell costimulatory blockers. The use of biologic DMARDs has been referred to as &quot;targeted therapy.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third category of DMARDs includes the drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tofacitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tofacitinib</a>, which shares some features with the nonbiologic DMARDs as an orally active small molecule drug but is an inhibitor of isoforms of the Janus kinases, which are cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases that are critical for signal transduction from plasma membrane receptors for a number of different interleukins. Janus kinase inhibition by this agent has biologic and clinical effects similar to the biologic agents.</p><p/><p>The results of representative clinical trials in patients with persistently active RA despite prior DMARD therapy will be reviewed here. The principles and strategies for treating such patients, as well as the randomized trials of nonbiologic DMARD combinations and of biologic agents, are presented in more detail separately.

The following examples include some commonly prescribed combinations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Triple therapy with MTX-SSZ-HCQ</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combination nonbiologic DMARDs were evaluated in a randomized trial of 102 patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), disease lasting more than six months, and a poor response to one DMARD or to two or more sequential DMARDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Triple therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX; 7.5 to 17.5 mg per week, titrated for response), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ; 500 mg twice daily), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ; 200 mg twice daily) was superior to SSZ plus HCQ or to MTX alone in achieving the primary endpoint of at least a 50 percent improvement at nine months (77 percent versus 40 and 33 percent, respectively), with sustained benefit for at least two years without the development of significant drug toxicity.</p><p>Additional support for the efficacy of a similar regimen was provided by a randomized trial in DMARD-na&iuml;ve patients who had RA for less than two years and who had persistent disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The patients were treated with MTX, SSZ, and HCQ or with SSZ with sequential switching (if the clinical responses were inadequate) to MTX and then to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>. The rate of remission was significantly higher in the patients treated with triple therapy at both one year (25 versus 11 percent) and two years (37 versus 18 percent). Triple therapy was also associated with significantly higher rates of at least a 50 percent response at one year (75 versus 60 percent) and with more limited joint damage at two and five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although treatment was unrestricted after two years, differences in radiographic damage persisted at five years of follow-up. Further evidence for this approach in patients with active disease despite MTX comes from the patients started on MTX alone in the Treatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], in which 72 percent of such patients required step-up to triple therapy or MTX plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>. The patients who were stepped improved significantly, regardless of which therapy they were given, and had clinical and radiographic results that were similar to those in patients who received initial combination therapy.</p><p>At least two major trials have now proven the efficacy of this triple regimen in patients who were selected for the trials based upon having active disease despite therapy with MTX. Both the RACAT trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and the Swefot trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] randomized patients with active disease to receive either full triple therapy or MTX plus a biologic. All groups of patients in both trials improved. In TEAR, there was no difference between the triple and the <span class=\"nowrap\">MTX/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a></span> groups clinically or radiographically. In Swefot, there was no difference at 6, 9, or 24 months between the groups and, importantly, two-year data revealed no difference between the groups with regard to work productivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">MTX-HCQ versus MTX-SSZ versus all three</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A two-year trial included 171 patients with disease of more than six months&rsquo; duration who had not received DMARD combinations; the patients were randomly assigned to a three-drug combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX; 7.5 to 17.5 mg per week), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ; 500 mg to 1000 mg twice daily), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ; 200 mg twice daily) or to two-drug regimens either of MTX plus HCQ or of MTX plus SSZ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The primary endpoint, which was the percent of patients who achieved an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 percent response (ACR20) response at two years, was significantly higher with the three-drug regimen (78 percent versus 60 and 49 percent, respectively). A similar difference was seen for ACR50 responses (55 percent versus 40 and 29 percent, respectively). The likelihood of a response did not appear to differ between patients who were MTX-naive and those who had previously received MTX but had responded inadequately. All treatment regimens were well-tolerated. The most common conventional combination used in practice may be MTX and HCQ.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">MTX-leflunomide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Leflunomide</a> (LEF) is usually used as an alternative to MTX, but the two drugs can also be used in combination. Although both drugs are potentially hepatotoxic, the rationale for combined therapy is based upon their differing mechanisms of action. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-dosing-and-adverse-effects-of-leflunomide-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology, dosing, and adverse effects of leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action'</a>.)</p><p>The addition of either LEF or placebo to MTX was compared in a randomized trial of 263 patients with persistently active disease despite treatment with MTX for at least six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The results of this trial are discussed in detail elsewhere but will be briefly reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=randomized-clinical-trials-of-combinations-of-nonbiologic-dmards-in-rheumatoid-arthritis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Randomized clinical trials of combinations of nonbiologic DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Leflunomide and MTX'</a>.)</p><p>The primary outcome, the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 after 24 weeks of therapy, was significantly higher in the group receiving LEF plus MTX (46.2 versus 19.5 percent). The combination was well-tolerated. The rate of discontinuation and the incidence of adverse events, which were predominantly mild or moderate, were similar in the two groups. Diarrhea and elevation of serum aminotransferases were the only adverse effects seen significantly more often with LEF plus MTX than with placebo plus MTX. Close monitoring for hepatotoxicity is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">MTX-cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A six-month randomized trial evaluated the combination of MTX with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (CSA) in 148 patients with severe RA; the patients were assigned to receive MTX (at the maximal tolerated dose) plus CSA (2.5 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) or MTX plus placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After six months of treatment, the combination of MTX and CSA resulted in a greater reduction in the tender joint count (the primary outcome) compared with MTX plus placebo (-7.5 versus -2.7 joints). The net decrease of -4.8 joints was equal to 25 percent of the initial tender joint count. An ACR20 response was achieved more often in the combination group (48 versus 16 percent). Clinical improvement was maintained when the study was extended for another 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>There were 17 patients in the CSA group and 12 in the placebo group who withdrew from the study. The threshold for CSA dose reduction was a 30 percent increase in serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This combination is infrequently used because of concerns regarding adverse effects including increased blood pressure and reduced renal function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">MTX-gold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injected gold salts are used infrequently because of significant toxicity, and there are only a small proportion of patients who have long-term efficacy without serious side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of gold compounds in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The addition of intramuscular (IM) gold injections to MTX may benefit some patients who are unable to use other potent alternative agents. In the METGO trial, 65 patients with RA and with a partial response to MTX (mean dose of 18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span> continued MTX and were randomly assigned to IM gold (aurothioglucose up to 50 mg once weekly as tolerated) or to placebo injections for 48 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients who received IM gold were significantly more likely to achieve the primary outcome, an ACR20 response at week 48 (61 versus 30 percent). ACR50 and ACR70 were also achieved more often with gold plus MTX (26 versus 4 percent and 21 versus 0 percent, respectively).</p><p>Adverse events were minor. Mucocutaneous side effects were frequent but usually required only temporary suspension of gold therapy. Gold-related adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of therapy in 11 percent of patients receiving gold.</p><p>This combination is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Additionally, MTX and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> have been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of anti-drug antibody formation to the monoclonal anti-TNF agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Patients were randomly assigned to twice-weekly subcutaneous etanercept (25 mg) or placebo, while continuing to receive MTX. Significantly more patients in the active therapy group than in the placebo group achieved an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response (the primary outcome measure) and an ACR50 response at 24 weeks of therapy (71 versus 27 percent and 39 versus 3 percent, respectively).</p><p>The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> and MTX may also be more effective in retarding radiographic joint damage than either agent alone. This was illustrated in the TEMPO trial of 686 patients with active disease of over six months&rsquo; duration who had responded inadequately to at least one DMARD but who had not received MTX. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three regimens: a combination of etanercept (25 mg twice weekly) and MTX (up to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week),</span> etanercept plus placebo, or MTX plus placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Clinical and radiographic assessments were made periodically during one year of study.</p><p>Greater improvements with the combination than with either drug alone were evident in symptoms and signs of disease activity, in physical function, in patient-reported outcomes, and in radiographic data. The primary efficacy endpoint was the ACR-N, the numeric index of the ACR response area under the curve (AUC) over the first 24 weeks. The ACR-N AUC was greater for the combination group than for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> alone or for MTX alone (18.3 versus 14.7 versus 12.2 percent-years). The difference between etanercept alone and MTX was also significant.</p><p>The combination also resulted in reduced radiographic joint injury compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> alone or with MTX alone according to the primary radiographic endpoint, the change in the modified Sharp score at week 52 (-0.54 versus +0.52 versus +2.80).</p><p>Results of the TEMPO trial at two years are available for 503 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-trials-of-combination-therapy-in-persistently-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Some benefit has been shown with the combination of MTX and anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, but this combination is used very infrequently because of the greater efficacy observed with use of TNF inhibitors compared with anakinra. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'MTX plus T-cell costimulation blockade'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'MTX plus IL-1 or IL-6 inhibition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'MTX-anakinra'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'MTX-tocilizumab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B lymphocyte depletion using a monoclonal antibody to CD20 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) has been assessed in various clinical trials.
