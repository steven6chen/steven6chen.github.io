As an example, a retrospective cohort study (n = 8045) found that subjects who smoked cigarettes throughout a 25 year observation period were more likely than never smokers to develop COPD (36 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Smoking tobacco through a Chinese water pipe (narghile) is also associated with an increased risk of COPD compared with never smoking (adjusted OR, 10.61; 95% CI, 6.89-16.34), challenging the assumption that filtering the tobacco smoke through water might be protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Genetic influences may enhance an individual's susceptibility to the detrimental effects of cigarette smoke.
