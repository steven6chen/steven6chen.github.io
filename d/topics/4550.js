This is particularly important in the first few hours after symptom onset, when the amount of myocardium salvageable by reperfusion is greatest. Coronary artery reperfusion, if performed in a timely manner, improves clinical outcomes compared to no reperfusion in nearly all groups of patients with an acute STEMI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Determinants of outcome&quot;, section on 'Time from hospital arrival (door-to-balloon time)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy#H69239847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p>Both primary percutaneous coronary intervention and fibrinolysis can restore blood flow in an acutely occluded coronary artery in a much shorter time than can coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and these procedures are preferred to CABG in most cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Selecting a reperfusion strategy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will address the indications, optimal timing, technical considerations, and outcomes of urgent or emergent CABG in patients with acute STEMI. The role of CABG in patients with non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-angiography-and-revascularization-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary angiography and revascularization for unstable angina or non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all studies of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolysis, outcomes improve as the time from symptom onset to reperfusion decreases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Determinants of outcome&quot;, section on 'Time from hospital arrival (door-to-balloon time)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy#H69239847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p>In most cases, PCI or fibrinolysis can usually restore flow to the ischemic myocardium more quickly than coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), largely attributable to delays in getting the patient to the operating room and the time it takes to complete the bypass surgical procedure. Thus, CABG is uncommonly used as the reperfusion strategy of choice in ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); it is estimated that CABG is performed in 5 percent or less of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. CABG may be considered for the following subgroups of patients with STEMI. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">After unsuccessful or complicated PCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most acute STEMI cases, the site of occlusion responsible for the MI can be identified and successfully opened with PCI and stenting. When successful, this leads to an improvement in clinical and electrocardiographic signs of ischemia. In a small minority of cases, either the culprit lesion cannot be identified or reperfusion cannot be reestablished. In such cases, patients with ongoing ischemia may benefit from <span class=\"nowrap\">urgent/emergent</span> CABG in an effort to minimize myocardial damage and decrease in-hospital morbidity and mortality. </p><p>Increased interventional experience and advances in technology have led to a decline in the incidence of acute complications of PCI (irrespective of whether it is in the setting of STEMI or not) to the range of 2 to 4 percent. Examples of complications for which urgent CABG might be indicated include failed stent deployment, extensive coronary artery dissection, perforation of a coronary artery leading to pericardial tamponade, or recurrent acute closure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Emergency CABG for failed PCI'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with either unsuccessful or complicated PCI who have ongoing ischemia and anatomy suitable for CABG should be referred for consideration of CABG as opposed to a strategy of medical therapy only. The rationale includes: older studies demonstrating acceptable surgical mortality after CABG in patients with failed balloon angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]; small observational studies that have shown benefit from CABG after PCI in patients with cardiogenic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; and evidence from all studies of patients who are reperfused with either fibrinolytic therapy or primary PCI in which outcomes are uniformly better than with medical therapy alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Determinants of outcome&quot;, section on 'Time from hospital arrival (door-to-balloon time)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy#H69239847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p>The risks and benefits should be discussed among members of a multidisciplinary team and with the patient and family. Factors favoring emergent CABG include a large amount of ischemic myocardium, good general health, bypassable vessels, and the ability to perform surgery within six hours of the PCI. The presence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia should also drive the decision for emergent CABG. (See <a href=\"#H358599859\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical complications of acute MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical complications of acute MI include rupture of the left ventricular free wall or interventricular septum and acute mitral regurgitation. Medical treatment alone results in close to 100 percent mortality in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Most of these patients will require emergency cardiac surgical repair of the mechanical defect; CABG will be performed at that time. The approach to these patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We prefer immediate CABG as opposed to PCI of the infarct related artery followed by CABG and repair of the mechanical defect since termination of the ischemia often does not lessen the adverse hemodynamic impact of the mechanical defect, which may cause death. However, in some patients, it may be appropriate to initially reperfuse the patient with PCI and then have the patient undergo cardiac surgery. For example, a patient with an acutely occluded (culprit) lesion in the circumflex coronary artery, significant mitral regurgitation, and severe disease in the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries (LAD and RCA) might benefit from acute PCI of the circumflex and then CABG to the LAD and RCA with repair of the mitral valve. </p><p>In all cases in which a mechanical defect has been identified, we recommend immediate consultation between the interventional cardiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon. Other members of a multidisciplinary team should be involved as necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">As the primary reperfusion strategy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with acute STEMI should receive either PCI or fibrinolysis as the primary reperfusion strategy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) Studies of patients treated with either fibrinolysis or PCI have demonstrated that outcomes improve as the time to reperfusion decreases. </p><p>Approximately 50 percent of patients with STEMI have multivessel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In stable patients with left main or severe three vessel coronary artery disease, CABG is often preferred to PCI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61364\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61364 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-left-main-coronary-artery-disease#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of left main coronary artery disease&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials or large, well-conducted observational studies that have compared PCI to CABG in patients with left main or severe multivessel disease in the setting of an acute MI. Our experience is that PCI can be performed successfully and without major complication in the majority of cases. The decision of whether to perform PCI or CABG as the primary reperfusion strategy in patients with left main coronary artery disease or severe multivessel disease who are unstable or who have ongoing ischemia is complex and should be individualized. Management should involve cardiothoracic surgeons and interventional cardiologists on a multidisciplinary team. The discussion should include deciding on the primary reperfusion strategy and subsequent steps after &ldquo;culprit lesion&rdquo; intervention if PCI is performed, as well as what will be done if initial catheter based therapy fails. The role of non-culprit PCI in STEMI patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions#H625058030\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Non-culprit lesions&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p>We believe it is reasonable to perform PCI of a culprit unprotected left main coronary artery if distal flow is abnormal and PCI can be performed more rapidly and safely than CABG. This recommendation is consistent with that made in the 2011 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/Society</span> of Cardiovascular angiography and Intervention PCI guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Patients who might benefit from CABG as the primary reperfusion strategy include those who are no longer showing signs of acute ischemia (patients who have stabilized) and have coronary anatomy at the time of coronary angiography that suggests a benefit from CABG as opposed to PCI. Patients with left main or severe multivessel coronary disease, particularly with depressed left ventricular systolic function or those with diabetes are examples. If the patient is stable without signs or symptoms of ongoing ischemia either clinically or by electrocardiogram, CABG should be strongly considered as the primary reperfusion strategy in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259318985\"><span class=\"h2\">Late presentation or recurrent ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with STEMI present late (after 12 hours) and are asymptomatic at the time of presentation; thus, urgent intervention is not necessary. Subsequently, some of these individuals develop recurrent or inducible angina or have reinfarction and require revascularization with either PCI or CABG. We suggest using recommendations made for patients with stable coronary artery disease as a guide for who should be referred for CABG and who for PCI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.) </p><p>A few patients with STEMI who have received successful primary PCI develop recurrent angina due to ischemia in a territory not reperfused at the time of PCI. Many of these patients should be referred for repeat revascularization with either PCI or CABG. For patients with multivessel disease who fall into this category within the first 48 hours after STEMI, we agree with the 2011 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association CABG guideline that states that urgent CABG is reasonable compared to a delayed strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2860987\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiogenic shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiogenic shock occurs in 6 to 7 percent of patients with acute MI (excluding patients with mechanical complications). This complication signifies loss of at least 40 percent of the left ventricular contractile mass. Mortality with medical treatment of cardiogenic shock in acute MI approaches 80 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiogenic shock in acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiogenic shock occurs most often in patients with left main or severe three vessel coronary artery disease, but can occur in patients with one- or two-vessel disease. Although the limited evidence suggests similar outcomes, we prefer PCI to CABG, irrespective of the extent of disease, if it can be performed in a timely manner by a skilled team and if a mechanical complication of STEMI is not present. The full discussion of the use of CABG in such patients is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction#H36\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and treatment of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Coronary artery bypass surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2860937\"><span class=\"h2\">After failed fibrinolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CABG is employed infrequently for revascularization after failed fibrinolysis. PCI is preferred in this setting because of increased risks of perioperative mortality and major hemorrhage with CABG, especially if the interval between administration of the fibrinolytic agent and surgery is short. In an analysis from the TIMI II study, 390 patients underwent CABG after fibrinolytic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients undergoing surgery within 24 hours of study, compared to those undergoing later surgery, had higher rates of perioperative mortality (17 versus 4 percent) and major hemorrhage (74 versus 51 percent).

They are associated with worse in-hospital mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials or important observational studies that evaluated the optimal management strategy in these patients. Small series have included patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia in the setting of acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These studies suggest that operative and long-term mortality (approximately 7 and 15 percent, respectively) are reasonable with urgent CABG and that the incidence of sudden death is reduced compared to no CABG.</p><p>As life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias often represent ongoing ischemia in the setting of STEMI, our approach to revascularization is similar to the broad population of patients with STEMI for whom we prefer PCI to CABG. We agree with recommendations made in the 2011 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association CABG guideline, which states that urgent CABG is a reasonable approach for patients with ongoing ischemia who will not undergo emergent revascularization with PCI and who have left main stenosis greater than or equal to 50 percent and or three-vessel coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those patients in whom coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) will be performed, the optimal timing depends on the indication.

Thus, patients who are continuously ischemic, hemodynamically unstable, or having recurrent life-threatening arrhythmias should be stabilized and transferred rapidly to the operating room. Resuscitation should continue en-route to surgery, and unnecessary delays should be avoided. Aggressive use of pharmacologic agents and the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) is essential to achieve stabilization. Percutaneous bypass may be used in some patients as part of resuscitation in the catheterization laboratory.

Under most circumstances, this can be accomplished more quickly with either primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolysis than with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Therefore, in patients with coronary anatomy suitable for surgery, the role of CABG after acute MI is probably limited to those with cardiogenic shock, unsuccessful or complicated primary PCI, mechanical complications, or those with a late presentation (after 12 hours) or early recurrent ischemia. STEMI patients who are not candidates for fibrinolysis or primary PCI should also be considered for CABG. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those patients in whom CABG will be performed, the optimal timing depends on the indication. Ongoing ischemia, cardiogenic shock, PCI failure, and mechanical complications are indications for emergency operation. The optimal timing in more stable patients with indications for CABG is unclear; the decision on timing should be made by a multidisciplinary team. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Patients who present later than six hours after onset of symptoms when myocardial necrosis has reached its peak should probably be delayed for three to four days to decrease mortality and morbidity, including bleeding complications. <br/><br/>For patients with recurrent or inducible ischemia or reinfarction, particularly those with multivessel disease, CABG within 48 hours is a reasonable strategy compared to more delayed revascularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias occurring in the setting of acute STEMI are associated with a significant increase in in-hospital mortality. Their presence does not alter any of our recommendations below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following are our recommendations for the use of CABG (or PCI) in patients with acute STEMI:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with STEMI, outcomes improve as the time from symptom onset to reperfusion decreases. In most cases, reperfusion can be achieved more quickly with fibrinolysis or PCI than with CABG. Thus, for most patients, fibrinolysis or PCI is preferred to CABG. This preference for PCI includes patients with one- or two-vessel disease who have cardiogenic shock, but are without mechanical complications, as the restoration of myocardial blood flow with PCI of the infarct related artery may take only minutes after diagnostic coronary angiography has been performed. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with left main (as the culprit lesion) or three vessel coronary artery disease, with or without cardiogenic shock, who do not have mechanical complications (such as acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of either the ventricular septal or free walls), we suggest immediate PCI rather than CABG (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). CABG is a reasonable alternative to PCI when it can be performed more rapidly than PCI. (See <a href=\"#H2860987\" class=\"local\">'Cardiogenic shock'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'As the primary reperfusion strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with unsuccessful or complicated PCI with evidence of ongoing ischemia and in whom the coronary anatomy is suitable for CABG, we recommend emergency CABG rather than medical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'After unsuccessful or complicated PCI'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients with hemodynamically significant mechanical complications, we recommended immediate CABG and attempt at repair of the mechanical defect rather than a strategy of PCI followed by cardiac surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical complications of acute MI'</a> above.)<br/><br/>For some patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation, primary PCI with hemodynamic support may reasonably preferred to CABG. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-in-patients-with-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gu YL, van der Horst IC, Douglas YL, et al.
