The interaction between the host and this important pathogen will be reviewed here. The wide variety of GAS infections are discussed separately. (See related topics.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>S. pyogenes</em> is a facultative, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains. It causes an array of infections involving the respiratory tract and soft tissues ranging in severity from mild to severe. The only known reservoirs are the skin and mucous membranes of the human host. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying these infections are poorly understood, largely because each is the culmination of highly complex interactions between the human host defense mechanisms and specific virulence factors of the organism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Group A <em>Streptococcus</em> (GAS) requires complex media containing blood products. It grows best in an environment of 10 percent carbon dioxide and produces pinpoint colonies on blood agar plates; these are surrounded by a zone of complete (beta) hemolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6629596\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification schemes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Lancefield classification divides streptococci into types A through O based upon acid-extractable carbohydrate antigens of cell-wall material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. GAS has also been subdivided based upon the surface expression of M and T antigens. Subtyping strains of GAS has proven invaluable for epidemiologic studies. High-resolution genotyping provides more specific determination of relatedness among strains isolated in outbreaks of GAS infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Finally, rapid sequencing of the gene-encoding M protein provides a rapid, definitive comparison of M-typeable and M-nontypeable strains. (See <a href=\"#H2172983\" class=\"local\">'M proteins'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6634754\"><span class=\"h1\">VIRULENCE FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different constituents and products of group A <em>Streptococcus</em> (GAS) have been identified as virulence factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F96487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96487 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2172983\"><span class=\"h2\">M proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>M proteins are important for understanding virulence and human immunity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2172989\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The M protein is encoded by the <em>emm</em> gene, a coiled-coil consisting of four regions of repeating amino acids (A to D), a <span class=\"nowrap\">proline/glycine&ndash;rich</span> region (which intercalates the protein into the bacterial cell wall), and a hydrophobic region (which acts as a membrane anchor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Region A, near the N-terminus, is highly variable; antibodies to this region confer type-specific protection. Within regions B, C, and D lies an area that binds one of the complement regulatory proteins, factor H; this causes steric inhibition of binding between antibody and opsonin (derived from complement), which effectively protects the organism from humoral immune surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>M protein also protects the organism against phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], although this can be overcome by type-specific antisera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/1,3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Anti-phagocytic properties'</a> below.)</p><p>More than 80 different M protein types of GAS have been described, and new M types are constantly emerging. Nontypeable strains of GAS may express minute amounts of M protein, express a totally new M type that is not reflected in the current typing protocols, or may lack M protein altogether. As an example, 60 nontypeable strains isolated from the upper respiratory tract demonstrated resistance to phagocytosis in normal serum or plasma, suggesting that these strains do in fact produce M protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This could result from mutations within the <em>emm </em>gene, leading to production of novel M proteins that no do not cross-react with standard polyvalent typing sera.</p><p>Heterogeneity within the <em>emm </em>gene has been demonstrated among M-1 strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one study, approximately half of randomly collected human sera samples opsonized all seven M-1 strains tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The remaining samples opsonized only some M-1 strains, suggesting that opsonic antibody may be strain specific rather than M protein&ndash;type specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>These limitations of serologic typing for surface M proteins with available polyclonal sera have demonstrated a need for an alternate means of M-type identification. In one study, investigators designed primer pairs that allowed amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the <em>emm</em> genes of all available M type reference strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sequence analysis of specific PCR products was used to accurately deduce <em>emm</em> genes corresponding with the majority of the known M serotypes. This was possible because the highly variable N-terminus of the M protein correlates with a variable 5' region of the <em>emm</em> gene that confers distinguishable M serotypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2172995\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaccine implications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typing of <em>emm</em> genes has important implications for GAS virulence and vaccine development. In one report of 5400 cases of invasive GAS infection, <em>emm</em> types 1, 3, and 12 were independent risk factors associated with mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The <em>emm</em> serotypes in a proposed 26-valent vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] accounted for 79 percent of isolates, for 85 and 88 percent of isolates implicated in necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, respectively, and for 79 percent of deaths. The authors calculated that the proposed vaccine could prevent up to 50 and 63 percent of invasive GAS infections among older adults and children, respectively. However, the distribution of these M types may not be uniform in all regions, and serotypes may shift over time, as has been observed with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. </p><p>A study demonstrated that convalescent sera from patients with skin and soft tissue infection provided opsonic antibody against not only the M-type of the causative strain but also to a cluster of genetically related M-types of group A streptococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This finding suggests that fewer peptides of M-protein may be required to provide protective antibodies in vaccine preparations.</p><p>The epidemiologic observation that pharyngitis is less frequent in adults compared with children suggests that immunity to GAS does occur; it is unclear whether an immune response is mounted against specific M proteins or also to other antigens produced by GAS strains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2173895\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytolysins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytolysins consist of streptococcal enzymes released by the bacteria. They include streptolysins, hyaluronidase, streptokinase, nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotidase, and deoxyribonucleases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2173901\"><span class=\"h3\">Streptolysin O</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Streptolysin O belongs to a family of oxygen-labile, thiol-activated cytolysins. There is substantial amino acid homology between streptolysin O and thiol-activated cytolysins from other gram-positive bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Cytolysins produce the broad zone of beta-hemolysis surrounding colonies of <em>S. pyogenes</em> on blood agar plates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68908\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68908 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The zone of hemolysis may be enhanced by stabbing the inoculum into the bottom of the culture media.</p><p>Thiol-activated cytolysins bind to cholesterol on eukaryotic cell membranes, creating toxin-cholesterol aggregates that contribute to cell lysis via a colloid-osmotic mechanism. Cholesterol inhibits both toxicity in isolated myocytes and hemolysis of red blood cells in vitro. In situations where serum cholesterol is high (such as nephrotic syndrome), falsely elevated anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers may occur because both cholesterol and anti-ASO antibody in serum neutralize streptolysin O (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>).</p><p>ASO titers vary with age, season, and geography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Healthy elementary school children frequently have titers of 200 to 300 Todd units per mL, while asymptomatic pharyngeal carriers tend to have very low titers, just above detectable. Following streptococcal pharyngitis, the antibody response peaks at about four to five weeks. Nonsuppurative complications such as rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis generally develop during the second or third week of illness. Therefore, it may be useful to perform one titer when a nonsuppurative complication is first suspected and subsequently repeat the titer approximately two weeks later. Antibody titers fall off rapidly in the next several months and, after six months, have a slower decline.</p><p>About 80 percent of patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis demonstrate a rise in antistreptolysin titer; however, this assay cannot be used as a measure of severity of glomerular destruction. In patients with suspected glomerulonephritis but with an undetectable ASO titer, prompt testing for other antistreptococcal antibodies such as anti-DNase B (detectable for six to nine months following infection), streptokinase, and antihyaluronidase should be performed. About 90 percent of patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis have a positive result if two antigens are evaluated; about 95 percent have a positive result if three antigens are evaluated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2174527\"><span class=\"h3\">Other enzymes that are virulence factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyaluronidase &ndash; Hyaluronidase is an extracellular enzyme that hydrolyzes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> in deeper tissues and may facilitate the spread of infection along fascial planes. Anti-hyaluronidase titers rise following <em>S. pyogenes</em> infections, especially those involving the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Streptokinase &ndash; Streptokinase is produced by all strains of GAS and is located in the extracellular milieu. Plasminogen-binding sites are found on the surface of GAS strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Once plasminogen is bound, streptokinase proteolytically converts bound plasminogen to active plasmin. Plasmin then cleaves fibrin into fibrin-degradation products. Bound plasmin cannot be inhibited by endogenous antiproteases. The role of streptokinase in GAS infections is unclear, although it may play a role in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotidase &ndash; Nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotidase (NADase) is an extracellular enzyme (also called NAD glycohydrolase) that is produced by many strains of GAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Its role in the pathogenesis of GAS infection is unknown. NADase has been shown to be expressed in M-1 and M-3 strains, but it does not appear to be expressed in GAS noninvasive strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There is excellent temporal correlation between NADase production by strains of GAS and the emergence of invasive infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This has been supported by an analysis of over 5000 strains of M-1 and the demonstration that mutation in a promoter of both NADase and streptolysin O correlated with emergence of invasive cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deoxyribonucleases A, B, C, and D &ndash; Expression of deoxyribonuclease (DNase) in vivo, especially DNase B, elicits production of anti-DNase antibody following either pharyngeal or skin infection.</p><p/><p>Streptolysin S is a cytolysin on the surface of group A streptococcus that hemolyzes red blood cells and likely other eukaryotic cells; its role in pathogenesis is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2175728\"><span class=\"h2\">Pyrogenic exotoxins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (type A, B, and C) induce lymphocyte blastogenesis, potentiate endotoxin-induced shock, induce fever, suppress antibody synthesis, and act as superantigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Alternate names include scarlatina toxins and erythrogenic toxins. The identification of these three types of pyrogenic exotoxins may partially explain why some individuals have repeat attacks of scarlet fever. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Cytokine induction'</a> below.)</p><p>The genes for streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and C (<em>speA</em> and <em>speC</em>) are transmitted by bacteriophage; stable production depends upon lysogenic conversion, and control of production is not fully understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The mechanism for control of exotoxin production is likely to be important, since it is well established that strain production of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A has varied over time. In addition, point mutations in the <em>speA</em> gene have been correlated with dramatic changes in the potency of SpeA toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Strains capable of producing SpeA and SpeB have been associated with severe cases of scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Although all strains of GAS are endowed with the gene for <em>speB</em>, not all strains produce the SpeB protein toxin. In addition, the quantity of toxin produced among SpeB-producing strains varies greatly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/26,28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,30,31</a>]. <em>speC</em> is also transmitted by bacteriophage, and expression is likewise highly variable. Mild cases of scarlet fever in England and the United States have been associated with <em>speC</em>-positive strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The mere presence of virulence factors may be less important than the dynamics of their production in vivo. For example, it has been demonstrated that approximately 40 and 75 percent of strains from patients with necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) produced SpeA or SpeB , respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The quantity of SpeA was higher for strains from patients with streptococcal TSS than for strains from patients with noninvasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Two new superantigens, mitogenic factor (MF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>] and streptococcal superantigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], have been described, but their roles in pathogenesis are not fully understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. It has been observed that disruption of the gene that encodes MF leads to failure to produce DNase B, with comparable virulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Excess production of M protein may also impart a mucoid colony morphology; this has been associated most commonly with M-18 strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>M-18 GAS strains producing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> capsule have been shown to resist phagocytosis and are virulent in mice, whereas the hyaluronic acid&ndash;deficient strains appear to be nonvirulent and readily killed by phagocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The strains lacking hyaluronic acid production can adhere to macrophages with greater avidity than the mucoid strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This suggests that hyaluronic acid capsule, like M protein, confers resistance to phagocytosis but that such capsules also interfere with adherence to eukaryotic cells.</p><p>Streptococci possessing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> capsule adhere to keratinocytes through specific receptors (CD44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell wall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cell wall is comprised of a peptidoglycan backbone with integral lipoteichoic acid components. The main function of these components is structural stability, although the exact function of lipoteichoic acid is unknown. Lipoteichoic acid may play a role in pathogenesis by facilitating the adherence of GAS to pharyngeal epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Peptidoglycan is capable of activating the alternative complement pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>Necrotizing fasciitis caused by GAS is characterized by a lack of neutrophils at the site of infection. Interleukin (IL)-8 is important for neutrophil transmigration and activation and can be degraded by <em>S. pyogenes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. IL-8&ndash;cleaving activity corresponds with the presence of <em>S. pyogenes</em> cell envelope proteinase. Cleavage of IL-8 prevents neutrophil recruitment and represents a novel mechanism of immune evasion by <em>S. pyogenes</em>.</p><p>SilCR is a pheromone peptide released by two GAS strains isolated from patients with necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis; it may represent a new GAS virulence factor. These strains degraded IL-8 in vitro and induced fatal necrotizing soft tissue infection in mice, characterized by decreased neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In vitro, M-14 strains grown in the presence of SilCR had decreased IL-8 proteolytic activity.

Unlike M protein, these molecules do not inhibit phagocytosis in the absence of type-specific antibody. Nonetheless, these molecules may play a role in pathogenesis by interfering with complement activation.</p><p>One study supported this hypothesis by demonstrating that IgG-binding protein from GAS selectively bound C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a protein that is intimately involved in the regulation of complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcus-virulence-factors-and-pathogenic-mechanisms/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The pathogenic mechanisms underlying these infections are poorly understood, largely because each is the culmination of highly complex interactions between the human host defense mechanisms and specific virulence factors of the organism. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Lancefield classification divides streptococci into types A through O based upon acid-extractable carbohydrate antigens of cell wall material. Rapid sequencing of the gene encoding M protein provides a rapid, definitive comparison of M-typeable and M-nontypeable strains. (See <a href=\"#H6629596\" class=\"local\">'Classification schemes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The M protein is encoded by the <em>emm</em> gene. M protein protects the organism against humoral immune surveillance and against phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. More than 80 different M protein types of GAS have been described; nontypeable strains of GAS may express minute amounts of M protein, express a totally new M type that is not reflected in the current typing protocols, or may lack M protein altogether. Typing of <em>emm </em>genes has important implications for GAS virulence and vaccine development. (See <a href=\"#H2172983\" class=\"local\">'M proteins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Streptolysin O is a cytolysin released by the bacteria; the host mounts antibody against this antigen that can be used as a diagnostic tool. Nonsuppurative complications such as rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis generally develop during the second or third week of illness. Therefore, it may be useful to perform one titer when a nonsuppurative complication is first suspected and subsequently repeat the titer approximately two weeks later. (See <a href=\"#H2173901\" class=\"local\">'Streptolysin O'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins are virulence factors with capacity to induce lymphocyte blastogenesis, potentiate endotoxin-induced shock, induce fever, suppress antibody synthesis, and act as superantigens. The genes are transmitted by bacteriophage.
