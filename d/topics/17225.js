Thus, most centers, including our own, do not perform thymectomy for patients age 60 and older.

In the absence of better evidence, there is no consensus as to whether a sternal-splitting approach is better than less invasive techniques, such as extended-transcervical or video-assisted ones, and the issue awaits an appropriately designed, prospective trial.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sternum-splitting approach (eg, an extended transsternal thymectomy or combined transcervical-transsternal thymectomy) is preferred by many thoracic surgeons and neurologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/15,16,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,23-25</a>]. It allows full exploration of the mediastinum into the neck to completely remove all thymic tissue and associated fat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Others advocate an &quot;extended-cervical thymectomy,&quot; which minimizes the impact of postoperative pain on ventilatory reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This requires only brief hospitalization, often one day, and a relatively small scar. This approach uses a special manubrial retractor for improved exposure and resection in the mediastinum, often with the associated use of mediastinoscopy. Some argue that this approach may not adequately expose the entire thymus, thereby increasing the risk of residual thymus being left behind. However, clinical improvement similar to transsternal thymectomy has been reported in several series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/17,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27-29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A simple transcervical procedure does not provide adequate surgical exposure of the thymus, results in significant residual thymus in many patients, and appears to have a lesser outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/15,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,30</a>]. It is rarely performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thymectomy using minimally invasive procedures, such as video-assisted thoracoscopy or robotic-assisted approaches, has been associated with low morbidity and mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/15,31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,31-36</a>]. A retrospective study that compared video-assisted thymectomy with the extended transsternal approach found no significant difference in MG remission rates or favorable outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. While technically feasible, the effectiveness of minimally invasive procedures compared with &quot;complete&quot; transsternal thymectomy awaits confirmation by additional clinical studies.</p><p/><p>Patients with myasthenia are generally at high risk for surgical intervention due to compromised respiratory function, but operative mortality of less than 1 percent can be obtained using current techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the patient with myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although there is controversy about which surgical technique is more effective in MG, there is no doubt that the less invasive approaches have a lower morbidity and shorter length of hospitalization than the more invasive ones. As an example, one series of 95 patients with MG found that the mean length of hospital stay was significantly shorter with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) than with a transsternal approach (1.9 versus 4.6 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymectomy-for-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

It is probably also helpful to taper the glucocorticoids as low as the clinical status allows in order to reduce postoperative infections and problems with wound healing.</p><p>Some have suggested that the response to thymectomy is better if thymectomy is performed early in the course of the disease. This is based on remission rates that are greater if performed early after the onset of disease than if performed later. However, the rate that patients go into remission is higher early in disease.

However, it is probably best to have the MG under reasonable control if possible, with minimal bulbar and respiratory symptoms, to avoid perioperative problems. (See <a href=\"#H1942868008\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our recommendations for thymectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109723\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109723 \">algorithm 1</a>) are as follows (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Patient age and severity of disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7669757\" class=\"local\">'Seronegative myasthenia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7669765\" class=\"local\">'MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thymectomy is indicated in all patients <strong>with thymoma</strong> if resection is feasible, regardless of the status of MG (eg, generalized, bulbar, ocular). Treatment of a thymoma consists of complete excision or, if this is not possible, radiation for both relief of myasthenic symptoms and prevention of local invasion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and management of thymoma and thymic carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients age &lt;60 years with nonthymomatous, generalized acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-associated MG, we recommend thymectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients age &lt;60 years with nonthymomatous, generalized seronegative MG (ie, no detectable AChR or MuSK antibodies), we suggest thymectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with nonthymomatous, generalized MuSK antibody-associated MG, and for most patients who are &ge;60 years of age, we suggest <strong>not</strong> performing thymectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of thymectomy in ocular MG is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Thymectomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treatment with one of the rapid immunotherapies (ie, plasmapheresis or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>) for patients with preoperative respiratory or bulbar symptoms prior to any surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The perioperative care of a patient with MG undergoing thymectomy should be managed by the surgeon in close collaboration with a neurologist or practitioner with expertise in MG. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative considerations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Rapid immunotherapies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several different surgical approaches are available in the absence of obvious thymoma. The goal of thymectomy is to safely remove as much thymic tissue as possible. This includes the thymus itself, as well as any potential extracapsular thymic tissue in the anterior mediastinal adipose tissue. There is no consensus as to whether a sternal-splitting approach is better than less invasive techniques, such as an extended-transcervical or video-assisted approaches.
