AKI is an important contributing factor to the morbidity and mortality of critically ill neonates.</p><p>The pathogenesis, etiology, presentation, and diagnosis of neonatal AKI is presented in this topic review. The diagnostic evaluation, management, and prognosis of neonatal AKI in children are presented separately.

Clinically, neonatal AKI has been most commonly defined as an SCr greater than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or an increase of at least 0.2 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (17 to 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> per day from a previous lower value. Of note, the SCr value at birth reflects the maternal SCr and normally decreases over time. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Normal neonatal renal function'</a> below.)</p><p>However, these definitions most likely underestimate the prevalence of neonatal AKI because of the range of GFR due to the effects of gestational age (GA) and postnatal age. Efforts have been made to reach a more accurate consensus definition based on normative data; however, it has been challenging to obtain this information, especially in very preterm infants (GA &lt;32 weeks).</p><p>Despite these limitations, definitions of neonatal AKI used in research studies have been published that rely on SCr, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modified Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) for newborns classifies the severity of AKI into stages based on changes in SCr [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-pathogenesis-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage 0 &ndash; No significant change in SCr</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage 1 &ndash; Increase in SCr by &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&ge;26.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> within 48 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage 2 &ndash; Increase in SCr by 150 to &lt;200 percent from previous trough level</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage 3 &ndash; Increase in SCr by 200 to &lt;300 percent from previous trough level or SCr &ge;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For preterm infants, AKI is based on exceeding critical SCr [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-pathogenesis-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GA 24 to 27 weeks &ndash; &gt;1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GA 28 to 29 weeks &ndash; &gt;1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GA 30 to 32 weeks &ndash; &gt;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p/><p>In our center, we continue to use the more practical clinical definition of an SCr greater than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or an increase of at least 0.2 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (17 to 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL NEONATAL RENAL FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neonate is more vulnerable to AKI than older individuals due to functional and developmental immaturity of the neonatal kidney that affects glomerular filtration and tubular function (eg, concentrating ability), hemodynamic changes that occur at delivery, and risk of hypovolemia due to large insensible water losses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201172303\"><span class=\"h2\">Glomerular filtration rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is challenging to ascertain normal neonatal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to variability based on gestational age (GA) and postnatal physiological changes and the difficulty of performing accurate clearance measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-pathogenesis-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Similar to GFR, SCr normally varies with gestational and postnatal age. SCr at birth is equal to the concentration in the mother (approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span>. In term infants, SCr declines rapidly in the first or two weeks of life to nadir values (SCr 0.2 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [18 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> which remain stable through the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-pathogenesis-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], whereas in preterm infants, the decline is slower and nadir values are reached over the first one to two months. In VPT infants (GA &lt;32 weeks), SCr may increase after birth, most likely due to low GFR and tubular reabsorption of creatinine, followed by a slower decline over two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-pathogenesis-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. SCr values for VPT over the first months of life are inversely related to decreasing GA. As a result, SCr levels remain higher in VPT compared with term infants in the first months of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111831\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111831 \">table 1</a>).

The reasons for poor urine concentrating ability in infants include low corticomedullary solute gradient, decreased formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a short loop of Henle, and interference by prostaglandins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-pathogenesis-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2366010890\"><span class=\"h3\">Sodium reabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to GFR, tubular reabsorption is lower in neonates compared with older individuals and is affected by gestational and postnatal age.
