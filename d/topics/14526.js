Most individuals with the mutation are heterozygous, although homozygosity for the mutation has been reported in a small percentage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Transmission is considered to be autosomal dominant and the risk of thrombosis in heterozygotes is increased approximately three- to fourfold over controls. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1483273536\" class=\"local\">'Risk of VTE'</a> below.)</p><p>The location of the base change is in the terminal nucleotide of the 3&rsquo; untranslated region of the gene, corresponding to the messenger RNA sequence responsible for polyadenylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

This may be due to effects on the rate of mRNA processing, the site of 3&rsquo; <span class=\"nowrap\">cleavage/polyadenylation,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the stability of the mRNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. </p><p>Heterozygotes for the G20210A mutation have approximately 30 percent higher plasma prothrombin levels than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Homozygotes have even higher levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, prothrombin levels cannot be used to make the diagnosis, because there is overlap with the normal range and the coefficient of variation in coagulation assays is relatively large. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The mechanism by which the prothrombin G20210A mutation increases the risk of thrombosis is incompletely understood but is thought primarily to involve an increased concentration of prothrombin in the circulation, possibly by increased efficiency of prothrombin mRNA 3&rsquo;-end formation and increased prothrombin biosynthesis without affecting the rate of transcription; increased glycosylation that promotes protein stability may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2484653702\"><span class=\"h2\">Other prothrombin gene variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other mutations or polymorphisms of the prothrombin gene other than G20210A have been described. In some cases these are prothrombotic and in others they are associated with increased risk of bleeding; the phenotype depends on whether they ultimately decrease or increase prothrombin activation. We do not routinely test for these in patients with suspected prothrombin G20210A mutation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prothrombin Yukuhashi</strong> &ndash; The Yukuhashi mutation was identified in an 11-year-old Japanese girl with venous thromboembolism (VTE); there was a strong family history of thrombosis during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Prothrombin Yukuhashi is a missense mutation (G1787T) that leads to a substitution of arginine for leucine at amino acid 596 of the protein. Thrombin generated from the abnormal protein was severely impaired in its ability to complex with antithrombin. Its procoagulant activity was impaired, but its reduced binding to antithrombin appeared to be dominant, resulting in prolonged procoagulant activity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C20209T</strong> &ndash; The C20209T polymorphism is adjacent to the G20210A mutation in the 3&rsquo; untranslated region of the prothrombin gene.

The carrier frequency of this variant is estimated to be approximately 0.4 percent, and it is predominantly found in African individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Subsequent analysis of additional C20209T heterozygotes confirmed a possible association with VTE, although small case-control studies have failed to show an increase in VTE, suggesting that if there is an association it may be very weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A19911G</strong> &ndash; The A19911G polymorphism is located in an intron in the prothrombin gene that has been proposed to modulate the G202010A mutation. In a case-control study involving 204 consecutive individuals with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 204 matched controls, all of whom had the G202010A mutation, the co-occurrence of A19911G led to an additional slight increase in VTE risk (odds ratio [OR] increased from 3.3 with the G202010A mutation alone to 5.9 with both G20210A and A19911G) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another case-control study found that A19911G increased the risk of VTE in individuals with the factor V Leiden (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.3-3.4) mutation but not those with prothrombin G20210A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>Defects in the prothrombin gene that reduce prothrombin levels (ie, that cause inherited prothrombin deficiency) are associated with an increased risk of bleeding rather than thrombosis.

As an example, in a series of 281 consecutive patients with VTE compared with 850 controls, the mutation was found in approximately 8 percent of cases and 2 percent of controls (adjusted odds [OR] ratio for thrombosis, 3.1; 95% CI 1.9-5.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other case-control series have reported adjusted ORs in the range of 2.8 to 3.8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/2,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19-22</a>]. </p><p>The risk of VTE is likely to be higher in individuals who are homozygous for the mutation than in heterozygotes, although there are insufficient data to provide a good estimate of the absolute risk. Even among homozygotes, however, not all patients will develop VTE. In a series of 36 individuals who were homozygous for the mutation, 12 (33 percent) developed VTE in the setting of an acquired prothrombotic risk factor such as pregnancy or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>It is not uncommon for an individual to have both the prothrombin G20210A mutation and the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation and for the combination to further increase VTE risk. In a pooled analysis of eight case-control studies involving 2310 individuals with VTE and 3204 controls, 51 of the cases (2 percent) were doubly heterozygous for both mutations (none of the controls were doubly heterozygous) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In the pooled analysis mentioned above, the use of oral contraceptives increased the odds of VTE with the prothrombin G20210A mutation from 3.8 to 7.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a case-control study of 42 women with VTE during pregnancy or postpartum and 213 controls without VTE, 31 percent of the women with VTE had the prothrombin G20201A mutation compared with 4.2 percent of controls (OR of 10.2; 95% CI 4.0-25.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This supports our practice of avoiding oral contraceptives in individuals with the mutation and having a lower threshold for thromboprophylaxis in certain other high-risk settings.

In a 2009 systematic review that included 18 articles addressing VTE recurrence risk, heterozygosity for the mutation did not confer increased risk of recurrent VTE (OR 1.45; 95% CI 0.96-2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
