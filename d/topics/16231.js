This topic will review the microbiology, clinical evaluation, and management of soft tissue infections due to human bites. Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites and animal and human bites in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-dog-and-cat-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and initial management of animal and human bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human bite wound pathogens consist of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including streptococci, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Eikenella</em>, <em>Fusobacterium</em>, <em>Peptostreptococcus</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, and <em>Porphyromonas </em>spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In a study of 50 patients with infected human bites, the median number of isolates per wound culture was four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Both aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54 percent of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44 percent, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2 percent.</p><p>Viral pathogens, including hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, and herpes simplex virus, are transmissible by human bites; clinical descriptions are limited to case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. Human bite transmission of syphilis has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human bite wounds can occur as a result of incidental or purposeful injury. Incidental injury may include self-inflicted wounds (such as paronychia due to nail biting or thumb sucking) or &quot;love nips&quot; to the face, breasts, or genital areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paronychia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paronychia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Purposeful injury to one individual by another may result in occlusional bites or clenched-fist injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Occlusional bites are frank bites by human teeth, most often to the fingers, hands, or arms. Involvement of the hand portends high risk for osteomyelitis and septic arthritis.</p><p>Clenched-fist injuries are the most serious of human bite wounds; they present as traumatic lacerations that occur when the clenched fist of one person strikes the teeth of another. The lacerations typically occur over the third and fourth metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal joints of the dominant hand. Although they are usually quite small (up to 15 mm), they are highly prone to infection given the proximity of the skin over the knuckles to the joint capsule. Relaxation of the fist may carry organisms into the deep compartments and the deep tendon spaces of the hand. Thus, patients with such injuries are at risk for deep soft tissue infection, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Many patients ignore these wounds until the onset of pain, swelling, or purulent discharge; as a result, these injuries are often complicated by established infection at the time patients seek medical attention.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of bite-wound infections may include tenderness, erythema, swelling, purulent drainage, lymphangitis, and fever. Pain near a bone or joint that is out of proportion to injury severity should suggest periosteal penetration with risk for osteomyelitis.</p><p>Cultures should be obtained at surgical debridement as discussed in the next section. In addition, radiographic imaging should be performed if the bite injury is in close proximity to a bone to evaluate for osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, tendonitis, or fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of human bites includes wound care, antibiotic therapy, and vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues related to wound care are discussed separately.

Antibiotic agents should be selected based on their activity against potential flora including <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>E. corrodens</em>, <em>H. influenzae</em>, and beta-lactamase&ndash;producing oral anaerobic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Agents lacking activity against <em>Eikenella corrodens</em> should be avoided; these include first-generation cephalosporins (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a>), penicillinase-resistant penicillins (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dicloxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dicloxacillin</a>), macrolides (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, and aminoglycosides. However, clindamycin may be used for anaerobic coverage if it is administered in conjunction with an additional agent that is active against <em>E. corrodens</em>.</p><p>When available, culture and susceptibility results should subsequently be used to tailor antibiotic therapy. With the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA), including community-acquired strains, consideration of this organism may be important for patients with appropriate risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53504 \">table 1</a>). The approach to the treatment of MRSA is discussed in detail separately.

Prophylactic oral antibiotics should be administered for three to five days, with close follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. On follow-up evaluation, signs of infection should prompt further evaluation (with radiographic imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical consultation, if needed) and an extension of the antibiotic course.</p><p>Routine HIV testing following human bites is not necessary. However, in special bite-injury circumstances (such as intentional bites of law enforcement personnel), rapid HIV testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> empiric postexposure prophylaxis pending results of testing may be warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of healthcare personnel exposed to HIV&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals whose wounds are clinically infected at initial evaluation should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and intravenous antimicrobial therapy.

Patients with complicated infections require prolonged therapy tailored to individual circumstances. For example, tenosynovitis should be treated for up to four weeks, and osteomyelitis usually requires at least six weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of such complications, the duration of antibiotic therapy should be tailored to clinical improvement. In the setting of bacteremia, 14 days of parenteral therapy should be administered. Otherwise, cellulitis and skin abscess usually respond to 5 to 10 days of therapy. Intravenous therapy may be switched to outpatient oral therapy with evidence of clinical improvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69328\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69328 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tetanus immune globulin</a> and tetanus toxoid should be administered to patients who have had two or fewer primary immunizations.
