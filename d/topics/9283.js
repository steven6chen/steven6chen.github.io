Internationally adopted children are at increased risk for common infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, intestinal parasites, skin infections, and infestations because they come from resource-poor countries where these conditions are common. Assuring that these children are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases often can be challenging. Many internationally adopted children have poor documentation of immunizations from their birth country or may not have had the opportunity to have received the vaccines routinely given in the United States.</p><p>Immunization of internationally adopted children and their close contacts will be discussed here.

However, documented immunity to diphtheria and tetanus (ie, &gt;0.1 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL)</span> can be used as a surrogate marker for immunity to pertussis because diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis usually are administered in combination (eg, as diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine or diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis vaccine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-immunization-considerations/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>]. However, the child's age and antibody level must be taken into consideration. As an example, acellular pertussis-containing immunization may be warranted in a two-year old who has protective but low antibody concentrations to diphtheria and tetanus (eg, &lt;0.4 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> because their immunity to pertussis is likely to wane before the four-year booster dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Poliovirus </strong>&ndash; Serologic testing for poliovirus is no longer recommended.
