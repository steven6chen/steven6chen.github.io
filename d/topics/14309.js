Encephalocele is one of the three most common neural tube defects (NTDs). The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of encephaloceles are discussed in this topic review.</p><p>The other main types of NTDs are anencephaly and myelomeningocele, which are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anencephaly, which is an open NTD as the affected region of the cranial neural tube is exposed to the body surface. It is a severe defect, and is not compatible with survival.

Some authors use the more general term &quot;cephalocele,&quot; and reserve the term &quot;encephalocele&quot; for lesions that include brain and &quot;meningocele&quot; for those that include only meninges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Classification of encephalocele is based on the cause and anatomical location of the skull defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13326758\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary encephalocele</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary encephaloceles are congenital and present at birth.

The lateral edges of the neural plate become elevated to form the neural folds and fuse to form the neural tube; the fusion begins in the cervical region and proceeds in both the rostral and caudal directions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81711 \">figure 1</a>). The rostral neuropore closes on the 25th day after conception, and the caudal neuropore closes two days later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Neural tube defects (NTDs) result from failure of the neural tube closure between 25 and 27 days after conception. The embryology of the neural tube is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types#H19221419\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closed spinal dysraphism: Pathogenesis and types&quot;, section on 'Normal cord development in humans'</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism causing primary (congenital) encephalocele is uncertain, although it involves defective closure of the anterior neural tube. Onset of the most severe lesions likely occurs prior to 26 days after conception; less severe lesions that primarily involve skull or meninges may occur later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Nasofrontal lesions are thought to result from defective separation of neural and surface ectoderm at the site of final closure of the rostral neuropore [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Anterior encephaloceles (sincipital and basal) probably result from defective development of the prosencephalic neural crest tissue. This mechanism is suggested by the patency of the midline foramina which are open only transiently during normal craniofacial development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>By contrast, the embryology of occipital encephaloceles suggests defective segmentation of the bones of the posterior cranium (supraoccipital, exoccipital, and basioccipital, and the posterior part of the parietal bones). These bones are not of neural crest origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459373\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Encephalocele is less common than other neural tube defects. Its prevalence has been estimated at 0.8 to 5 per 10,000 live births. In a report from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, 115 cases were identified from 701,458 live births during 1979 to 1998, a prevalence of 1.64 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These cases included 91 liveborn infants, 18 stillbirths, and 6 elective terminations (likely an underestimate). Males and females were equally affected.</p><p>Occipital encephaloceles are the most frequent type in North America and Western Europe, where approximately 85 percent of encephaloceles take this form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Their incidence ranges between 1 in 3000 to 1 in 10,000 live births. On the other hand, in Southeast Asia, parts of Russia, and central Africa, anterior encephaloceles are more frequent (1 in 3500 to 1 in 5000) than the occipital type. The true incidence of secondary encephaloceles is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459380\"><span class=\"h1\">INHERITANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated encephaloceles (ie, those that are not associated with other congenital anomalies) have generally not been shown to be familial. One exception is an autosomal dominant form of occipital encephalocele with incomplete penetrance that was reported in a Vietnamese family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Most of the affected individuals in this family were developmentally normal and had normal neurologic exams except for skin-covered occipital bulges. Therefore there was no evidence for any of the known genetic syndromes associated with encephaloceles in this family.</p><p>Encephaloceles may be part of specific genetic syndromes if there are associated anomalies. The inheritance pattern for these syndromes is usually autosomal recessive, in which case the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is substantial. As an example, the risk of recurrence for an encephalocele with Meckel Gruber syndrome is 25 percent. (See <a href=\"#H3459422\" class=\"local\">'Associated anomalies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459415\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of encephalocele are variable depending upon the type (location) and severity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sincipital (fronto-ethmoidal) encephaloceles may be occult lesions that are not noticeable or may present with marked craniofacial deformities (hypertelorism, telecanthus, orbital dystopia, or unilateral <span class=\"nowrap\">micro/anophthalmos)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basal encephaloceles may or may not be apparent on external inspection, but there may be a broadened nasal bridge, hypertelorism, or other midfacial anomalies. Affected patients may present as a nasal or epipharyngeal mass, difficulty breathing, recurrent upper tract infections, nasal discharges, recurrent meningitis, or CSF leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occipital encephaloceles usually are obvious at the time of birth and many are diagnosed prenatally by ultrasonography. The neural tissue usually is covered by skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69847\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69847 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114348 \">picture 2</a>). Those of relatively large size may be associated with cranial nerve deficits, poor sucking and feeding, spasticity, blindness, seizures, or developmental delay. Neurologic deficits may progress after birth if hydrocephalus develops. Occipital encephalocele also may be associated with hind-brain anomaly (Chiari III malformation) in which herniating <span class=\"nowrap\">occipital/cerebellar</span> tissues distort the posterior fossa structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74322\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74322 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chiari-malformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chiari malformations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The protruding tissue of an encephalocele may consist of normal brain or fibrous atrophic gliotic tissue which has little or no function. In a nasofrontal encephalocele, most of the herniating mass consists of nonfunctional gliotic neural tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. On the other hand, occipital encephaloceles may include a variety of tissues. In a series of occipital encephaloceles, 32 percent contained cerebral tissue, 21 percent included cerebral and cerebellar tissue, 5 percent had cerebellar tissue, and 37 percent had glial nodules or dysplastic neural tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459422\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED ANOMALIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with encephalocele frequently have other malformations that may be part of recognized syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/11,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17,18</a>]. In a series from Atlanta, at least one other major structural congenital defect was present in 17 of 83 (20 percent) of affected liveborn infants with encephalocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is a smaller proportion than in other series, due to exclusion of infants with chromosomal abnormalities, other major CNS lesions, and amniotic bands.</p><p>The most common of the associated syndromes is Meckel Gruber syndrome (Meckel syndrome, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/249000&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootvp3ssM86wOnxIOFqyKtC9MOPupBKAyoCZEeQj232mIh&amp;TOPIC_ID=6171\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #249000</a>), which includes occipital encephalocele, microcephaly, microphthalmia, polycystic kidneys, ambiguous genitalia, polydactyly, cleft lip and palate, and other malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

These include deformities of the tentorium, complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, and myelomeningocele. Individuals with occipital encephaloceles frequently have hydrocephalus (30 to 50 percent), corpus callosal abnormalities (18 percent), and cerebral dysgenesis (13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459429\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is apparent at birth in most of the occipital encephaloceles. Basal encephaloceles may present as a midline mass in the nose or may not be visible. An encephalocele may be mistaken for a nasal polyp if it is located within the nose or for a soft tissue tumor if it is covered with skin and anterior to the nose. These basal encephaloceles, either ethmoidal or sphenoidal, tend to present with meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3662326\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging should be performed to evaluate the intracranial components of the malformation and identify any associated brain or vascular anomalies. Computerized tomography (CT) scans are effective for detection of the extent of cranial defects. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is effective for detection of the extent of neural herniation. It is especially useful for basal encephaloceles. Neuroimaging will also detect hydrocephalus, if present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5208824\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis is accomplished by maternal screening of serum AFP levels and ultrasonography (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Prenatal screening and diagnosis'</a>).</p><p>With ultrasonography, encephaloceles appear as a defect in the calvarium containing a cystic or solid mass with a gyral pattern that is contiguous with the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Prenatal ultrasonography detects approximately 80 percent of encephaloceles. Fetal MRI has higher sensitivity for neural tube defects (NTDs), and can be used in cases where ultrasound results are not optimal or the diagnosis is uncertain, or to evaluate high-risk cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management#H1902864778\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Follow-up of screen positive MSAFP results'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3662296\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions which can appear similar to an encephalocele include neoplasms, congenital cysts, vascular malformations, and inflammatory lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68011 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The considerations vary depending on the location of the encephalocele. In general, encephaloceles are more likely to vary with respiration or crying. Imaging usually distinguishes the encephalocele by demonstrating the skull defect and communication with the intracranial space.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459436\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When diagnosed prenatally, vaginal delivery may be safe if the lesion is relatively small. Large encephaloceles require cesarean section.</p><p>Surgical treatment is appropriate in most cases unless the encephalocele is massive and there is severe microcephaly or other lethal anomalies. The procedure basically consists of removing the overlying sac and closing the defect including the dural defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In patients with basal encephaloceles or CSF leakage, prompt closure is important to reduce the risk of infection. Patients with hydrocephalus usually undergo ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement prior to encephalocele repair to prevent postoperative CSF leaks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459443\"><span class=\"h2\">Sincipital encephaloceles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unless there is CSF leakage, sincipital encephaloceles can be treated electively, ideally early in infancy to avoid deleterious effect of an enlarging encephalocele on craniofacial structures.

Ideally, a craniofacial team usually consisting of neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons perform the repair. Reconstruction of the skull and dural defect is important to prevent meningitis. In the case of sphenoidal encephalocele, particular caution must be used during the repair because the third ventricle, hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and optic pathway may be present in the encephalocele sac.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459457\"><span class=\"h2\">Occipital encephaloceles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical management of patients with occipital encephalocele depends on the type of neural tissue that is protruding beyond the skull, as assessed by inspection during surgery. If the herniating mass consists of gliotic tissue, the mass is transected flush with the skull.</p><p>If the mass contains normal brain, attempts should be made to preserve it. Several techniques have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expansion cranioplasties have been used to accommodate large amounts of herniated neural tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. One technique of expansion cranioplasty uses tantalum mesh to create an extracranial space for herniating tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular volume reduction is a two-stage technique in which the ventricles are artificially expanded, followed by intracranial transposition of the neural tissue. In the first stage, the dural sac is closed; this increases ventricular pressure to produce ventriculomegaly. After hydrocephalus develops, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is placed, and then herniated brain is transpositioned into the new intracranial space as the ventricle contracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To preserve herniated occipital and cerebellar parenchyma, the tentorium is incised, creating infratentorial space, and the cerebral cortex retracted into this space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459464\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For sincipital encephaloceles, craniofacial operations can usually be performed without intraoperative mortality or major complications. Most patients with nasofrontal encephaloceles have normal or near-normal intelligence and ultimately do well following the repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The prognosis for patients with occipital encephalocele depends on the extent of herniated neural tissue in the sac and on the presence of associated anomalies. In one series, 17 percent of all patients with occipital encephaloceles had normal mental and physical development, and 83 percent were mentally <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physically impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The subset with few anomalies and a small amount of neural herniation had a 53 percent chance of being physically and mentally normal, 28 percent chance of normal intelligence but physical impairment, and 19 percent chance of intellectual disability (mental retardation). In a separate series of 30 patients with occipital encephalocele, the mortality rate was 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Factors related to prognosis include the size of the sac, the contents of the neural tissue, hydrocephalus, infection, and pathologies that accompany the condition.</p><p>One series from a single center suggests that hydrocephalus and other intracranial abnormalities predict neurodevelopmental outcome, but the location (type) of the cephalocele does not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a retrospective analysis of 85 cases of cephaloceles (68 encephaloceles and 17 meningoceles) 40 were frontal, 33 occipital, and 12 parietal. The most common associated intracranial abnormalities included hydrocephalus (27 percent), seizure disorder (20 percent), corpus callosal abnormalities (18 percent), and cerebral dysgenesis (13 percent). Cognitive development was normal in 48 percent of patients, and mildly, moderately, or severely delayed in 11, 16, and 25 percent of patients, respectively. On multivariate analysis, only hydrocephalus and the presence of intracranial abnormalities were significant predictors of developmental delay.</p><p>Seizure disorders are present in approximately 20 percent of patients with congenital encephalocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

In a literature review of 18 cases of encephaloceles with seizure, six (33 percent) were extra-temporal and 12 (67 percent) were temporal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-congenital-encephalocele/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. For the purpose of seizure control, all extra-temporal encephaloceles were managed with resection of the encephalocele. Among patients with temporal lobe encephaloceles, eight (67 percent) were treated with encephalocele resection and extended lobectomy, and four (33 percent) were treated only with resection of the encephalocele.

Those with associated anomalies may be part of specific genetic syndromes such as Meckel Gruber syndrome, in which case the recurrence risk may be substantial. (See <a href=\"#H3459380\" class=\"local\">'Inheritance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3459422\" class=\"local\">'Associated anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary encephaloceles are divided into sincipital, basal, and occipital types; the management and the prognosis vary among these types. (See <a href=\"#H13326731\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sincipital encephaloceles range from occult lesions that are not noticeable to those with marked craniofacial deformities (hypertelorism, telecanthus, orbital dystopia, or unilateral <span class=\"nowrap\">micro/anophthalmos)</span>. Unless there is CSF leakage, sincipital encephaloceles can be treated electively, ideally early in infancy. (See <a href=\"#H3459443\" class=\"local\">'Sincipital encephaloceles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basal encephaloceles may be trans-sphenoidal, spheno-ethmoidal, trans-ethmoidal, and spheno-orbital (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60761\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60761 \">image 1</a>), and may or may not be apparent on external inspection. They may present as a nasal or epipharyngeal mass, difficulty breathing, recurrent upper tract infections, nasal discharges, recurrent meningitis, or CSF leaks. They require prompt surgical repair because of high prevalence of meningitis. (See <a href=\"#H3459450\" class=\"local\">'Basal encephaloceles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occipital encephaloceles usually are obvious at the time of birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69847\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69847 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114348 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74322\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74322 \">image 2</a>). Many are diagnosed prenatally by ultrasonography. Those of relatively large size may be associated with cranial nerve deficits, poor sucking and feeding, spasticity, blindness, seizures, or developmental delay. Surgical management of patients with occipital encephaloceles depends on the type of neural tissue that is protruding beyond the skull. (See <a href=\"#H3459457\" class=\"local\">'Occipital encephaloceles'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Towgifhi J.
