For patients with four or fewer isolated hepatic lesions, five-year relapse-free survival rates after resection range from 24 to 58 percent, averaging 30 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74509 \">table 1</a>). Many of these patients are potentially cured (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases&quot;</a>). However, the majority are not surgical candidates because of tumor size, location, multifocality, or inadequate hepatic reserve.</p><p>There are several nonsurgical treatment options for patients with liver-isolated CRC metastases who are not candidates for potentially curative resection. These include systemic chemotherapy, regional chemotherapy via the hepatic artery, selective internal radiation using yttrium-labeled glass or resin microspheres, and regional tumor ablation (hyperthermic or radiofrequency coagulation, intratumoral injection of ethanol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a>, and cryotherapy).</p><p>Local or regional treatment approaches may be considered after the cancer has progressed on systemic therapies but remains isolated to the liver or as a means of delaying the need for systemic chemotherapy in patients who have liver-isolated metastatic disease. Whether this rationale is valid or not is unclear. Although these methods (particularly radiofrequency ablation, RFA) can provide local control in a high number of patients, whether there are any long-term survivors (ie, cures) remains uncertain. Moreover, it is unclear whether the sequential use of regional treatments followed by systemic chemotherapy at the time of progression provides better long-term benefit in terms of duration of symptom control or survival than systemic chemotherapy alone.</p><p>This topic review will focus on nonsurgical methods for local tumor ablation, regional chemotherapy into the hepatic artery, and radiotherapy. Resection and the use of pre-resection (induction) chemotherapy, as well as systemic treatment strategies for metastatic CRC, are addressed elsewhere.

However, whether all patients need biopsy confirmation of suspected metastatic disease is debated. Many oncologists feel it is important to provide tissue documentation of the first site of noncurable disease, while others consider that biopsy is not necessary in a patient with a history of CRC in the preceding five years who has a new elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and new unresectable liver lesions on imaging that are clinically suspicious.</p><p>The risk of tract seeding from percutaneous fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy appears small (only a handful of case reports are described in journals listed in MEDLINE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]), although this complication was described in 5 of 51 cases of biopsy-proven hepatic colorectal metastases in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TUMOR ABLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with isolated liver metastases from CRC who are not amenable to potentially curative resection because of tumor size, location, multifocality, or inadequate hepatic reserve, local methods of tumor ablation provide an alternative to systemic chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-completed-clinical-trials\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: Completed clinical trials&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be administered as an outpatient procedure and is the preferred procedure. The best results with RFA are in patients with three or fewer lesions that are each 3 cm or less in diameter and are not located near major vascular structures. These are the same patients for whom surgical resection is often considered, and an important unresolved issue is whether long-term outcomes with RFA are as favorable as with resection. At present, resection is the preferred approach, if feasible. Another approach that can be considered for selected patients with initially unresectable disease is systemic chemotherapy followed by reevaluation for resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefit of RFA for regional treatment of liver metastases in patients with extrahepatic disease who are undergoing systemic chemotherapy remains uncertain, and this approach should not be considered standard at present. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Radiofrequency ablation'</a> below.)</p><p>Local tumor ablation can be accomplished in many ways. The direct intratumoral instillation of alcohol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a> or hyperthermic ablation (using radiofrequency waves or microwaves) has largely replaced cryotherapy as the methods of choice. In general, lesions that are amenable to surgical resection also lend themselves to ablative treatments (one or a few metastases, none greater than 5 cm in diameter). Thus, local ablative methods may be considered a less morbid alternative to surgical resection in patients who are at high risk for or otherwise not candidates for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing clinical benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard methods to assess treatment response (eg, unidimensional RECIST criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74693 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], bidimensional perpendicular measurement using WHO criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) involve measurement of tumor dimensions before and after treatment. Methods such as these disregard the extent of necrosis, which is the end result of locoregional ablative therapies.</p><p>Among patients treated for primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC), the efficacy of percutaneous ablation therapy is assessed by dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) one month after therapy. The absence of contrast uptake within the tumor is thought to reflect tumor necrosis, while the persistence of contrast uptake indicates persistent disease. Recurrence of tumor in the treated area (or elsewhere) is signaled by the reappearance of vascular enhancement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-radiofrequency-ablation-percutaneous-ethanol-injection-thermal-ablation-and-cryoablation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical therapies for localized hepatocellular carcinoma: Radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, thermal ablation, and cryoablation&quot;, section on 'Assessing response to locoregional therapies'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with liver metastases, contrast enhancement is typically absent, and there is no consensus on appropriate endpoints to define clinical benefit from locoregional therapies. Treated tumors characteristically show low density on posttreatment CT scans. These regions, which are often interpreted as tumor necrosis, are often larger than the area of the original tumor. However, this appearance is nonspecific and should not be considered to represent an objective response.</p><p>A reduction in serum levels of tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) may not be accompanied by objective tumor shrinkage. However, at least some data suggest a correlation between the magnitude of CEA decline and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In view of these issues, probably the most important factor in determining benefit is the time to progression for the individual lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperthermic coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperthermic coagulative necrosis can be accomplished by radiofrequency waves or by lasers or microwaves (mainly outside of the United States). As with percutaneous intratumoral injections and cryotherapy, hyperthermic coagulation is limited by the difficulty in determining the true lesion margin, which often extends beyond the leading edge, and the lack of specificity of tissue damage. In contrast to cryosurgery which requires operative intervention, these procedures can be performed percutaneously.

It is a potential option for patients with potentially resectable isolated liver metastases &lt;5 cm who are not surgical candidates.</p><p>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely applied to patients with primary hepatocellular cancer and metastatic liver tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-radiofrequency-ablation-percutaneous-ethanol-injection-thermal-ablation-and-cryoablation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical therapies for localized hepatocellular carcinoma: Radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, thermal ablation, and cryoablation&quot;, section on 'Radiofrequency ablation'</a>.)</p><p>RFA can be performed with open, laparoscopic, or percutaneous approaches. Some studies have reported that the approach by which RFA is performed has an impact on tumor recurrence rates, with the fewest local recurrences after open RFA, followed by laparoscopy, and finally percutaneous RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. However, local tumor recurrence rates overlap broadly with each technique, and physician experience (as well as the type of RFA equipment) is also inversely related to local recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. An expert panel convened by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to review the evidence on RFA for CRC liver metastases concluded that there is insufficient evidence to resolve the issue of optimal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The highest ablation success rates are achieved in patients with a solitary metastasis or a few metastases that are all less than 3 cm in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. The relationship between size and local recurrence rate is likely related to the size of the thermal injury that can be created by modern RFA devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Because the objective of thermal ablation is to induce coagulative necrosis of the targeted tumor as well as a rim of normal hepatic parenchyma (5 to 10 mm), the best results are obtained when the tumor is smaller than the size of the coagulative necrosis produced by a single ablation probe (currently about 4 cm). Local failure rates increase dramatically when tumor size increases, especially beyond 5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>The location of the tumors within the liver also impacts on the success of RFA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions that are located near large (&ge;1 cm) blood vessels may be inadequately treated because of the heat sink effect of rapid blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous RFA may sometimes be avoided for treatment of lesions that are located in the dome or along the inferior liver edge for fear of diaphragmatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] or intestinal perforation. However, with attention to technique (such as insulating adjacent bowel from the thermal process, an approach that can be accomplished using a laparoscopic or open laparotomy approach), these lesions can be successfully treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Tumors at the inferior edge of the liver should not be treated percutaneously (and instead by a laparoscopic or open approach) if the stomach, duodenum, or transverse colon lies in close proximity to the tumor.</p><p/><p>The vast majority of published data on efficacy of RFA for CRC liver metastases come from retrospective series, many of which have limited follow-up (20 months or less); there are few published randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/12,31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,31-36</a>]. A systematic review of the literature on RFA for CRC liver metastases reported a wide range of five-year survival (14 to 55 percent) and local recurrence rates (3.6 to 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, both the retrospective series and limited number of prospective trials consist of a variable mix of patients with potentially resectable liver-isolated disease and unresectable liver metastases with or without extrahepatic disease involvement. </p><p>Among appropriately selected patients with potentially resectable liver metastases, whether the results with RFA are as good as can be achieved with surgical resection with or without postresection chemotherapy remains an open question. There are no randomized trials. Many retrospective comparative series suggest lower local recurrence rates and better progression-free survival, and in some cases better overall survival, after resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/37-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42</a>]. However, retrospective comparisons such as these cannot be used to ascertain the superiority of resection over RFA because patients treated with resection alone versus RFA differ across several important clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Definitive conclusions cannot be made in the absence of randomized trials directly comparing both approaches.</p><p>Nevertheless, given the evidence from retrospective reports that resection improves overall survival, particularly in the absence of extrahepatic disease, a systematic review of the literature by an expert panel from ASCO concluded that there is not enough evidence to support the use of RFA over resection in patients with potentially resectable CRC liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A similar conclusion was reached in a 2012 Cochrane review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>RFA is sometimes applied intraoperatively following incomplete resection in patients with isolated liver metastases from CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/38,45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,45-48</a>] and in those with extrahepatic disease involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, the benefits of RFA in these settings (as compared with systemic chemotherapy alone) remain unproven. In particular, there is no evidence to support a survival or quality of life benefit to ablating liver metastases in the presence of extrahepatic disease. One team of investigators reported their 10-year experience in 234 consecutive patients with CRC liver metastases who were not candidates for resection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failed chemotherapy, and underwent laparoscopic RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Fifty-five (24 percent) had extrahepatic disease at the time of RFA, which was not specifically treated. The median survival for all patients after RFA was 24 months, and the actual three- and five-year survival rates were 20 and 18 percent, respectively. Survival was not worse among patients with extrahepatic disease involvement. However, this appears to be the only published report that notes no difference in survival for patients with versus without extrahepatic disease involvement. Although data on the use of post-RFA chemotherapy were not provided, it is likely that at least some of the prolonged survival was attributable to salvage chemotherapy since the median progression-free survival for the patients undergoing RFA who had no overt extrahepatic disease was only six months. </p><p>The ASCO expert panel concluded that there is not enough evidence to justify the use of RFA in patients with viable extrahepatic disease and those with unresectable liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617936754\"><span class=\"h4\">RFA in patients undergoing chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few series provide data on the use of RFA combined with chemotherapy. Some reports focus on tumor outcomes while others report per-patient outcomes. End points have not always been reported in the same way, and survival or recurrence was sometimes reported from diagnosis of metastatic CRC or from the first or subsequent RFA procedure. All of these issues compromise the assessment of long-term outcomes when RFA is combined with chemotherapy.</p><p>In the only trial to prospectively investigate the benefit of adding RFA to systemic therapy to systemic chemotherapy, 119 patients with non-resectable isolated CRC liver metastases (85 percent previously untreated) were randomly assigned to chemotherapy (6 months of FOLFOX with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>) with or without RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. RFA was used as a sole local treatment in 53 percent, and the remainder underwent combined RFA and resection. The trial was initially planned as a phase III trial, but was transitioned to a phase II trial because of slow accrual. In the initial report, patients who received combined therapy had a significantly higher three-year progression-free survival (28 versus 11 percent), but overall survival, the primary endpoint, was not significantly better (30 month survival 62 versus 58 percent). However, in a later analysis of 10-year overall survival results, patients randomly assigned to RFA in conjunction with chemotherapy had a significantly longer median survival (45.6 versus 40.5 months), and eight-year overall survival (36 versus 9 percent; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33-0.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Patients receiving RFA in conjunction with systemic therapy had fewer liver recurrences (65 versus 82 percent), and a higher extrahepatic recurrence rate (35 versus 14 percent). At the RFA sites only 11 of 170 lesions recurred (6.5 percent) in 9 patients (15 percent of the total). Although posttreatment salvage chemotherapy details were not provided, the cause of death was progressive disease in significantly fewer patients who underwent local ablative treatment (57 versus 81 percent).</p><p>While this study is suggestive of long-term benefit from the addition of RFA in patients with liver-dominant metastatic CRC who are undergoing systemic chemotherapy, additional experience in a larger number of patients is needed before this can be considered a standard approach. In our view, this approach should be reserved for clinical trials or for highly selected patients who are not surgically resectable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617937446\"><span class=\"h4\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RFA is a relatively well-tolerated technique; however, severe and potentially fatal complications can arise. In the ASCO systematic review, the reported mortality rate was 0 to 2 percent, and the major complication rate was between 6 and 9 percent in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>One of the largest series to address complications included 312 patients with hepatic tumors (predominantly colorectal metastases) who underwent 350 procedures (226 percutaneous and the remainder intraoperative) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Five deaths were attributed to treatment (one each from liver failure and colon perforation, three from portal vein thrombosis). Portal vein thrombosis was significantly more common in cirrhotic (two of five) compared with noncirrhotic livers (0 of 54) after intraoperative RFA performed during a Pringle maneuver.

Although the one, two, three, and five-year survival rates for patients receiving SIR-Spheres (72, 39, 17, and 4 percent, respectively) did not differ significantly from those of patients in the control arm (68, 29, 7, and 0 percent, respectively), Cox regression analysis suggested a survival benefit for patients who lived longer than 15 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171137934\"><span class=\"h3\">SIRT plus systemic chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend against the addition of SIRT to modern oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy for treatment of patients with chemotherapy-na&iuml;ve metastatic CRC.

The efficacy and potential for additive toxicity of combined therapy with SIR-Spheres plus modern oxaliplatin-containing conventional chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone was directly addressed in three parallel multinational phase III trials (SIRFLOX, FOXFIRE, and FOXFIRE-Global) in which chemotherapy-na&iuml;ve patients with CRC liver metastases not amenable to potentially curative resection or ablation were randomly assigned to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (with or without an investigator-chosen biologic agent) alone or with a single treatment of SIRT concurrent with cycle 1 or 2 of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/118-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">118-120</a>].

Furthermore, combined treatment was associated with significantly more grade 3 or 4 adverse events (especially hematologic toxicity). Of the 11 treatment-related deaths on study, eight were in the chemotherapy plus SIRT group, three of which were attributed to radiation-induced liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H1807899113\" class=\"local\">'Survival benefit relative to systemic chemotherapy alone'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171137940\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy-refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These findings do not negate the data suggesting that patients who have failed multiple systemic chemotherapy regimens may benefit from radioembolization with SIR-Spheres [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/122-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">122-129</a>]. A year 2014 systematic review of 20 studies comprising 979 patients found that rates of complete radiologic response, partial response, and stable disease were 0 (range 0 to 6), 31 (range 0 to 73), and 40.5 (range 17 to 78) percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. Approximately 57 percent had a serologic response (reduction in serum carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]). The median time to intrahepatic disease progression was 9 months, median time to disease progression overall was 4.9 months, and the median overall survival was 12 months. Overall, acute toxicity developed in 11 to 100 percent (median 41 percent), most of which was mild (grade 1 or 2). However, the wide range of delivered radioactivity, different treatment volume (ie, lobar versus whole liver) and <span class=\"nowrap\">method/timing</span> of posttreatment evaluation, and variable percentages of patients with extrahepatic disease and concurrent use of chemotherapy in some studies compromise the ability to interpret the results.</p><p>There are only limited data on the hepatic parenchymal response to radioembolization. Among the changes that are described are transient transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, ipsilateral hepatic lobar volume decrease with contralateral lobar hypertrophy (a phenomenon that has been termed &ldquo;radiation lobectomy&rdquo;), induction of liver fibrosis, and portal hypertension. The frequency and risk factors for development of these adverse effects and their influence on liver insufficiency are not well characterized. Complications of radioembolization are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

A consensus panel from the Radioembolization Brachytherapy Oncology Consortium suggested that radioembolization be limited to patients who meet the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unresectable metastatic hepatic disease with liver-dominant tumor burden, and a life expectancy &gt;3 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An absolute contraindication to 90Y microsphere treatment is a pretreatment 99mTc macroaggregated albumin scan that demonstrates the potential for &ge;30 Gy radiation exposure to the lung or flow to the gastrointestinal tract that cannot be corrected by catheter techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative contraindications include limited hepatic reserve, irreversibly elevated serum bilirubin levels, compromised portal vein (unless selective or superselective radioembolization can be performed), and prior radiotherapy involving the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1807899113\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVIVAL BENEFIT RELATIVE TO SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY ALONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While local tumor ablation is often used for unresectable CRC liver metastases, it has not been clear whether local therapy contributes to better survival, and few, if any, studies have utilized modern systemic combination chemotherapy as the control arm. (See <a href=\"#H25787231\" class=\"local\">'HIA plus systemic chemotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H171137934\" class=\"local\">'SIRT plus systemic chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p>This issue was directly addressed in a randomized phase II trial in which 119 patients with initially unresectable CRC liver metastases and no extrahepatic disease were randomly assigned to systemic treatment alone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> and short-term infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>) or with aggressive local treatment by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with or without resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Eligibility was limited to patients with fewer than 10 lesions that could all be treated with RFA alone or with combined treatment, which included resection of resectable lesions and RFA of nonresectable lesions. At a median follow-up of 9.7 years, there was a significant difference in overall survival that favored combined treatment (hazard ratio [HR] for survival 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.88); three-, five-, and eight-year overall survival rates were 57, 43, and 36 percent in the combined therapy arm versus 55, 30, and 9 percent in the chemotherapy-alone arm. While this randomized study suggests that combining local ablative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical resection with systemic chemotherapy improves survival in patients with liver-limited metastatic CRC, one must interpret the results cautiously. The study was closed early due to poor accrual and was conducted in the early 2000s when many of the new therapeutic options were not yet available. Nonetheless, the overall survival exceeded 40 months in both arms, suggesting extremely unusual patient selection leading to a group of patients with remarkable prognoses. While it is quite possible that the findings reflect the truth, this study should be applied carefully to patients who fit the exact criteria defined in the study. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4188918817\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
