The changes in laboratory values during pregnancy are illustrated by one study, which compared liver function tests in 103 pregnant women with matched controls who were not taking oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An understanding of these changes may be important in the assessment of liver disease in pregnancy. Compared with matched, nonpregnant controls:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum albumin was significantly lower in all trimesters due to hemodilution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations were significantly higher (up to two to four times normal) in the third trimester. This is primarily due to placental alkaline phosphatase. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels are reduced, and 5'-nucleotidase levels are slightly increased, indicating that the excess alkaline phosphatase is not derived from the liver. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enzymatic measures of cholestasis (eg, alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were slightly higher in the second trimester, but the values were within the normal ranges. There were no differences in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total and free bilirubin concentrations were lower in all three trimesters, while conjugated bilirubin was lower during the second and third trimester. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total bile acid concentrations were not significantly different.</p><p/><p>These findings suggest that in normal pregnancy, most liver biochemical tests remain within the normal range, even if slightly increased or decreased from baseline levels. Thus, serum aminotransferase, bilirubin, or fasting total bile acid concentrations above the normal range during pregnancy may be pathologic and should prompt further evaluation. On the other hand, hypoalbuminemia and an elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase may be a normal component of pregnancy and, if within the above ranges, do not usually indicate the presence of liver disease. The prothrombin time is unchanged during pregnancy, and serum fibrinogen increases in late pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706197294\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF HEPATOBILIARY DISEASE IN PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospital discharge data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest all-payer hospital inpatient care database in the United States, showed the following types and frequencies of pregnancy-related liver disease from 2002 to 2010; the denominator is 1000 pregnancy hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute fatty liver of pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, icterus gravis pregnancy, necrosis of liver of pregnancy, and hepatorenal syndrome following delivery: 7.18 </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallbladder <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/cholelithiasis:</span> 4.65 </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis C: 1.70 </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary tract disease: 1.67 </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B: 0.96 </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome: 0.95 </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic and alcohol-related liver disease: 0.30 </p><p/><p>In a prospective study from Wales, selective testing at clinician discretion detected 142 pregnant women with abnormal liver tests, which represented 3 percent of the deliveries during the 15-month study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of cases were attributed to pregnancy-specific disorders (eg, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, obstetric cholestasis, hyperemesis gravidarum, acute fatty liver of pregnancy); the remainder of cases was attributed to other conditions (eg, sepsis, drug-related, bile duct stones, hepatitis) or of uncertain etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in the nonpregnant patient, a practical approach for evaluating suspected hepatobiliary disease involves a systematic search for patterns that are characteristic of a particular disease, and judicious diagnostic testing to exclude other causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50080 \">table 3</a>).Timing of the biochemical and clinical manifestations of liver abnormalities may be critical in determining the etiology and treatment plan.</p><p>When evaluating a pregnant patient with suspected hepatobiliary disease, it is important to ask specific questions about the past medical history, including prior pregnancies. Patients with abnormalities in liver biochemical tests may recall that these were present prior to the pregnancy. Similarly, a history of injection drug use or transfusion provides a risk factor for chronic viral hepatitis.</p><p>The cardinal features of hepatobiliary disease can include jaundice, pruritus, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a variety of liver biochemical test abnormalities. Most are not unique to pregnancy. However, specific patterns that occur during a particular trimester may lead to easy recognition of the underlying disease. As an example, hyperemesis gravidarum, characterized by nausea, vomiting and mild to moderate elevations in serum aminotransferases and bilirubin, typically has its onset in the first trimester and usually abates by 20 weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a>.) Diseases such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy are most common in the third trimester. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p>Nevertheless, careful evaluation for other disorders that can produce similar symptoms and laboratory abnormalities is prudent. Patients with viral hepatitis, for example, may present with nausea, vomiting, and liver biochemical abnormalities. Furthermore, while specific diseases are typically confined to a particular trimester, exceptions occur. As an example, acute fatty liver of pregnancy usually occurs in the latter part of the third trimester, but has been reported at 26 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, some diseases that occur during the late second or the third trimester can also present postpartum, especially preeclampsia or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF A LIVER BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A liver biopsy is rarely necessary for the diagnosis of the liver diseases that are specific to pregnancy, such as hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy (see appropriate topic reviews). Because it is invasive, a liver biopsy should be performed only when the diagnosis is in doubt and the results could influence treatment or the timing of delivery. One example is a patient who has an atypical presentation of acute fatty liver of pregnancy early in the third trimester. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A percutaneous liver biopsy with ultrasound guidance can be performed safely during pregnancy in patients who otherwise do not have contraindications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If coagulation disorders are present, a transjugular liver biopsy can be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-liver-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to liver biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transjugular-liver-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transjugular liver biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical scenarios</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following clinical examples demonstrate the approach to diagnosing specific disorders in pregnant women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">A patient with elevated aminotransferases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 26-year-old woman gravida 3 para 2 currently in her 14th week with a singleton gestation is hospitalized with intractable nausea, vomiting, and dehydration. During her two prior pregnancies, she also had severe nausea and vomiting, which resolved early in the second trimester. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She has not traveled in the past year, and does not take any medications (including over-the-counter agents and herbal compounds) other than prenatal vitamins and folate. Her physical examination is notable for dry mucus membranes, and a gravid uterus. She has no abdominal pain, and does not have a palpable liver or spleen.</p><p>Her initial laboratory examination reveals elevations in serum aminotransferases ALT (175 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L),</span> AST (122 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L),</span> serum total bilirubin (2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Amylase and lipase are normal. The albumin is slightly decreased from normal values, but consistent with pregnancy. Liver biochemical tests prior to pregnancy are not available. A right upper quadrant ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis shows elevated ketones. Serology for hepatitis A, B, and C is negative, antinuclear antibodies are absent, and serum protein electrophoresis is normal (making autoimmune hepatitis unlikely). Thyroid-stimulating hormone is normal. Obstetrical ultrasound examination demonstrates a normal singleton gestation.</p><p>The patient is treated with antiemetics and intravenous fluids and improves clinically. Over the next few weeks, her symptoms continue to be present, but remain tolerable and do not require hospitalization. Her serum aminotransferases decline to the low 100s, and serum bilirubin normalizes. At 20 weeks of gestation, her symptoms completely abate, and her liver biochemical tests return to normal.</p><p>This patient's clinical course and occurrence of symptoms early during pregnancy are consistent with hyperemesis gravidarum. Exclusion of viral or autoimmune hepatitis helps assure that these conditions are not causing or contributing to the liver disease. Elevations in the serum aminotransferases are typically less than 200 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> often with the serum ALT being greater than the serum AST. A right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated normal appearing hepatic parenchyma without biliary duct dilation. The patient's history helps to exclude drug toxicity, which may give rise to similar liver biochemical abnormalities. The normal obstetrical ultrasound excludes hydatidiform mole and multiple gestation as causes of her symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">A patient with intractable itching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 23-year-old woman gravida 2 para 1 at 35 weeks with a singleton gestation is referred from a dermatologist for intractable itching. The itching is primarily on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet. It is present day and night, and keeps her from sleeping. The patient also had itching during her first pregnancy in which the fetus died in utero in the third trimester. She states no explanation was given for the fetal demise and the pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated. Autopsy and karyotype of the fetus were normal. She has no known prior history of liver disease or risk factors for viral hepatitis. Her physical examination is notable for numerous skin excoriations related to scratching and a gravid uterus. She has no abdominal pain and a nonpalpable liver or spleen.</p><p>Laboratory evaluation is notable for elevations of serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin (ALT 1201 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> AST 910 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> total bilirubin 3.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> alkaline phosphatase 400 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L)</span>. The gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) is normal, but total serum bile acid concentrations are 10 times normal. Viral hepatitis serologies are negative. A right upper quadrant ultrasound is normal.</p><p>This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). Serologic testing excluded viral hepatitis, and the high level of aminotransferases with normal GGTP makes primary biliary cholangitis unlikely. The absence of abdominal pain, fever, or biliary duct dilation helped exclude choledocholithiasis and cholangitis. The patient's prior history of itching during pregnancy is helpful, since intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy tends to recur (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies'</a> below). High serum bile acid concentrations are associated with higher risk of fetal demise. Intrauterine demise during her prior pregnancy may reflect the adverse fetal outcomes associated with this condition and should prompt her clinician to advise increased fetal monitoring with consideration of early delivery. We suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> in patients with ICP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">A patient with elevated aminotransferases and hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 23-year-old woman gravida 1 para 0 currently with twin gestation at 30 weeks is hospitalized with hypertension, for which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a> had been prescribed at 28 weeks of gestation. Despite treatment, she continues to be mildly hypertensive and is developing a progressive rise in serum aminotransferases, which are over 85 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span>. Hepatitis serology and markers for autoimmune hepatitis are negative. Her platelet count, peripheral blood smear, and right upper quadrant ultrasound are normal. Urinalysis is normal except for 1+ proteinuria.</p><p>The differential diagnosis in this case includes severe preeclampsia, toxicity due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a>, and early acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Considering the above differential diagnosis and the preterm gestation, a reasonable approach would be to discontinue the methyldopa, place her on bed rest, control her hypertension with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, and administer a course of corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity in case preterm delivery becomes necessary. The patient and fetus should be closely monitored in the hospital. Progressive reductions in aminotransferase concentrations would suggest that she either had toxicity due to methyldopa or temporary improvement in preeclampsia, which sometimes occurs after hospitalization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Expectant management of preeclampsia with severe features&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Within 36 hours, the patient develops progressive thrombocytopenia, worsening hypertension, and a headache; and her serum aminotransferase concentrations continue to rise, suggesting severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome. This constellation of findings warrants delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26373073\"><span class=\"h3\">A patient with nausea and vomiting in the third trimester</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 32 year-old woman gravida 1 para 0 with a singleton gestation at 34 weeks of gestation is admitted to the hospital with a three-day history of nausea and vomiting, malaise, and jaundice.

White blood cell count and prothrombin time are elevated. She denies any recent travel. Hepatitis serologies were sent, but are unavailable.</p><p>The patient most likely has acute fatty liver of pregnancy. The differential diagnoses include HELLP syndrome and atypical preeclampsia, but acute fatty liver is more likely because of the coagulopathy, jaundice, and minimal changes in blood pressure and urine protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57913\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57913 \">figure 1</a>).

Most are not unique to pregnancy. However, specific patterns that occur during a particular trimester may lead to easy recognition of the underlying disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Approach to differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperemesis gravidarum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abnormal liver tests presenting in the first trimester. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy should be considered in patients with pruritus and abnormal liver tests, especially in late pregnancy. Affected pregnancies are at increased risk for prematurity and stillbirth. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> and early delivery should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute fatty liver of pregnancy, preeclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome should be considered in late pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. Patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy can develop liver failure. Delivery is the primary treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral or drug-induced hepatitis should be considered in any of the trimesters of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Approach to differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A practical approach for evaluating suspected hepatobiliary disease involves a systematic search for patterns that are characteristic of a particular disease and judicious diagnostic testing to exclude other causes. Common clinical scenarios are presented above. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical scenarios'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When evaluating a pregnant patient with suspected hepatobiliary disease, it is important to ask specific questions about the past medical history, including prior pregnancies. Patients with abnormalities in liver biochemical tests may recall that these were present prior to the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Approach to differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver biopsy is rarely necessary for the diagnosis of liver diseases occurring during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Role of a liver biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of recurrence during subsequent pregnancies is variable. It may not be possible to accurately predict the risk in individual patients. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong> &mdash; The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Dr. Yannick Bacq for his past contributions as an author to prior versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Riely CA.
