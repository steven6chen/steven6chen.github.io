The vast majority of cases are ischemic, in which increased pressure compromises the vascular circulation (ie, a type of compartment syndrome). Over time, repeated episodes cause permanent damage and erectile dysfunction. Thus, priapism is considered a medical emergency in which timely diagnosis and appropriate management are vital to preserving normal function. This is a challenging management area because there are few experts dedicated to managing priapism in SCD and few large trials on which to base practice, and management often involves multiple specialties including urology, emergency medicine, pediatrics, and hematology.</p><p>This topic review discusses our approach to the evaluation and treatment of priapism and erectile dysfunction in boys and men with SCD.</p><p>Related subjects, including the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> and regular blood transfusion, as well as overviews of the other clinical findings and routine management of SCD, are presented separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyurea</a> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical features &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine management (child) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine comprehensive care for children with sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine management (adult) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1426467961\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Priapism is defined as persistent penile erection that is not related to sexual interest or desire. It can be categorized as low flow (ischemic) or high flow (nonischemic). Low-flow priapism accounts for the vast majority of cases of priapism in individuals with SCD.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low-flow priapism</strong> &ndash; Low-flow priapism (also called ischemic or veno-occlusive priapism) is responsible for over 95 percent of priapism presentations in SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is associated with decreased or absent blood flow in the penile arteries caused by high pressure in the venous sinuses in the corpora cavernosa, which leads to tense rigidity and pain, similar to compartment syndromes in other parts of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Major episodes</strong> &ndash; While ischemic priapism can last for any duration of time, the longer the duration of the erection, the greater the potential for permanent damage to penile tissue. Episodes lasting &ge;4 hours (sometimes referred to as major episodes) are especially concerning because ischemia for this length of time is associated with a greater risk of permanent tissue damage. Beyond 24 hours, there may be tissue necrosis and scarring, leading to erectile dysfunction (ED).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Stuttering priapism</strong> &ndash; Stuttering priapism (also called recurrent ischemic priapism [RIP]) is a variant of ischemic priapism characterized by brief, recurrent episodes of transient, self-limited priapism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Each episode typically lasts for a few minutes to up to three hours. Like other forms of ischemic priapism, the episodes are painful and unrelated to sexual interest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High-flow priapism</strong> &ndash; High-flow priapism (also called nonischemic or arterial priapism) is a rare form of priapism in which the arterial blood supply to the cavernous tissue is disrupted. This typically occurs in the setting of penile trauma, penile arterial aneurysm, or iatrogenic causes (eg, needle injury). Fistula formation between the cavernous artery and the lacunar spaces results in unregulated penile engorgement. This form of priapism is typically not painful and may resolve spontaneously with minimal complications; emergency interventions often are not needed.</p><p/><p>ED is generally defined as the inability to achieve or sustain an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. ED is a common complication of priapism in SCD; it results from repeated episodes of ischemia-induced tissue damage that interfere with the normal vascular changes that lead to erection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3720449970\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of priapism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basal, flaccid state of the penis is maintained by inputs from the sympathetic nervous system that produce high vascular and smooth muscle tone. Penile erection normally occurs in response to inputs from the parasympathetic nervous system (eg, from genital stimulation or psychosexual excitement). These parasympathetic inputs increase arterial blood flow to the penis via the cavernous and helicine arteries, filling the sinusoids and leading to distension of the trabecular cavernosal tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66964\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66964 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Distension of the cavernosal tissue in turn reduces venous outflow and permits sustained engorgement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Reflex erections are physiologic erections not due to sexual excitement (eg, during rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They can occur in any age (even neonates and young children).</p><p>Low-flow priapism occurs when the venous outflow from the penis is impaired; there is increased pressure in the penile compartment that prevents normal blood circulation, leading to hypoxia, acidosis, and tissue ischemia. High-flow priapism occurs when the arterial inflow into the penis is increased, often due to trauma or injury to the cavernosal artery that creates a fistula between the artery and lacunar spaces. Tissue ischemia is not a major component of high-flow priapism because venous outflow remains intact. As a result, high-flow priapism typically is not painful and often resolves spontaneously.</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) signaling is one of the principal mediators of erection; it causes smooth muscle relaxation in response to parasympathetic inputs. NO is produced in neuronal and endothelial cells by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), using arginine and oxygen as precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. NO readily diffuses into smooth muscle cells in the cavernosal artery and the sinusoidal space, where it activates guanylate cyclase, leading to increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP-dependent protein kinases produce signals that ultimately reduce intracellular calcium, leading to smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation, and increased blood flow into the penis.</p><p>The erectile response is terminated when phosphodiesterases (PDEs; especially PDE-5, the target of erectile dysfunction drugs) hydrolyze and inactivate cGMP, leading to smooth muscle contraction. This mechanism does not appear to function normally in some individuals with SCD. This may be because NO signaling also regulates PDE-5 protein expression; when NO is chronically depleted (as in individuals with SCD), PDE-5 levels are lower and the setpoint for termination of the erection is altered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. An increased risk of priapism in the setting of a low NO state is counterintuitive since penile erection requires the presence of high levels of NO. It is thought that in cases of chronically low NO and low PDE-5, the penile vasculature may become hypersensitive to other sources of cGMP and may lack a corresponding mechanism to hydrolyze cGMP and terminate an erection.</p><p>Many episodes of SCD-associated priapism occur upon awaking from sleep, as REM-sleep erections are common and occur by the same mechanisms. Sleep-related erections are also highly androgen-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; this explains why anti-androgens may be helpful in some individuals who have frequent priapism episodes upon awaking from sleep. (See <a href=\"#H1421062183\" class=\"local\">'Hormonal therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>Evidence linking NO depletion with priapism in SCD includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mouse models of reduced NO synthesis (double NOS knockout [dNOS<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">-/-</sup>])</span> have priapism and pronounced erectile responses and reduced PDE-5 signaling; a similar phenotype is seen in mouse models of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In both the dNOS<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">-/-</sup></span> and the SCD mice, treatment with a compound derived from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> that acts as an NO donor was able to reverse the priapism phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with SCD have decreased circulating NO levels. This is due to chronic hemolysis, which releases free hemoglobin into the plasma, where it acts as a potent NO scavenger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Hemolysis also releases the enzyme arginase into the circulation; arginase depletes NO by metabolizing the NO precursor arginine into ornithine. NO may also be decreased by excess superoxide anion, a byproduct of oxidative stress. In a case-control study that evaluated data from participants in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), individuals who had a history of priapism had evidence of more clinically severe SCD, including higher rates of stroke, acute chest syndrome, and acute painful episodes, as well as increased laboratory markers of hemolysis such as lower hemoglobin level, higher reticulocyte count, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and higher bilirubin level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Reduced NO bioavailability has also been proposed to contribute to pulmonary hypertension in SCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease#H879456971\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary hypertension associated with sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In mouse models of priapism and individuals with SCD-associated priapism, levels of PDE-5 are low, which may lead to an altered set-point for PDE-5 function in affected individuals. We have hypothesized that treatment with a PDE-5 inhibitor leads to increased NO synthesis, which in turn restores PDE-5 to normal levels; this may explain the paradoxical effect of chronic administration of a PDE-5 inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> in reducing priapism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H583812064\" class=\"local\">'PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The physiology of ischemic priapism in individuals with SCD remains an area of active investigation. As an example, adenosine also mediates vasodilation and NO synthesis, and mouse models have also suggested a role for elevated levels of adenosine in priapism, although it is not known whether a similar effect occurs in people with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,14</a>]. Mechanical sludging of red blood cells (RBCs) in the penile vasculature, previously thought to be responsible for priapism in SCD, is considered less likely to play a major role. Additional discussions of the general mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in SCD are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516437559\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of ED</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ED results when the normal response to sympathetic inputs is blunted, preventing normal erections. There are many factors that contribute, as discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of male sexual dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In SCD, a major mechanism of ED is prior episodes of ischemic priapism. Over time, ischemia leads to cell injury and inflammation, culminating in irreversible cell injury and fibrosis in the corpora cavernosa. More prolonged ischemia (eg, episodes lasting longer than 12 hours) and more frequent episodes of ischemia are likely to increase the risk of ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. The age at which the episodes occur may also contribute; some series have reported that priapism during childhood is less likely to result in ED than priapism in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The irreversibility of ED may also be in question, as at least one case report has described ED in a teenager that resolved after 18 months of therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In addition to ED, individuals with priapism may fear sexual intercourse because of the risk of precipitating a priapism event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of priapism in SCD is high. Some series estimate that approximately 35 to 45 percent of men with SCD are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15-17,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17,20,21</a>]. The actual prevalence may be higher as some individuals may be reluctant to discuss this symptom with their providers or to report it in surveys. In a survey of 104 boys and men from Jamaica who were &quot;not reticent to discuss it,&quot; at least one episode of priapism was reported by 44 individuals (42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Priapism can affect individuals with any of the SCD syndromes (eg, sickle cell anemia, sickle-beta thalassemia, hemoglobin SC disease).</p><p>Priapism in SCD may occur at any age, but typically it becomes a more significant clinical problem after puberty. The median age of onset is in the teenage years (approximate age, 12 to 15 years), with the first episode occurring before age 20 in 75 to 90 percent of affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15,16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,21</a>]. In a series from a pediatric urology clinic that included 155 boys with SCD, priapism occurred in 10 (6.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Individuals with priapism commonly have stuttering priapism (72 percent of the individuals with priapism in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The vast majority of patients with SCD and priapism are homozygous for hemoglobin S. However, priapism has been described in patients with hemoglobin SC disease, sickle cell beta thalassemia, as well as in those with sickle cell trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23,24</a>].</p><p>Rarely, individuals without prior knowledge of their SCD status may present with priapism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a review of the underlying conditions associated with priapism in children and adolescents, SCD accounted for 65 percent of cases; the remainder were related to trauma, leukemia, or medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) following episodes of priapism is very common in individuals with SCD, with various series reporting prevalences of 20 to 30 percent of individuals with SCD who have had prior episodes of priapism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Priapism is a clinical diagnosis made when an unwanted erection is present. Most individuals do not have a history of trauma; a history of trauma or surgery on the penis may suggest damage to the cavernosal artery and high-flow, nonischemic priapism. However, as noted above, the majority (&gt;95 percent) of priapism cases in SCD are low-flow, ischemic priapism. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p>Ischemic priapism is painful. Often the erection is present upon awaking from sleep. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,26</a>]. It typically occurs in an otherwise well individual (ie, it does not typically occur in the setting of another acute vaso-occlusive illness such as stroke or acute chest syndrome). However, other sites of pain may be present, and there may be a history of an acute illness with fever or dehydration. (See <a href=\"#H2812734528\" class=\"local\">'Precipitating factors'</a> below.)</p><p>The duration of the erection is not relevant to diagnosis, but it has implications for the likelihood of long-term complications and thus has an impact on the urgency and type of interventions needed. Typical episodes last for one to two hours, but many individuals have shorter, more frequent episodes (stuttering priapism) or major episodes (lasting longer than four to six hours) (see <a href=\"#H1426467961\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above). Stuttering episodes often occur in clusters, approximately two to three times per week for several weeks prior to the abating of symptoms. In other cases, stuttering priapism is a precursor to a major priapism episode. In a review of 39 patients with priapism who presented for medical care, the mean duration of symptoms was 22 hours (range 6 to 70 hours), with four presenting to the hospital more than 36 hours after the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a series from Jamaica, 23 patients had experienced prolonged major episodes of priapism lasting more than 24 hours; of these, 14 (61 percent) were preceded by multiple episodes of stuttering priapism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. An erection lasting longer than four to six hours due to low-flow, ischemic priapism is a urologic emergency. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Ischemic priapism: Acute management'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency of episodes is also variable. Some individuals have only a single episode, while others have as many as 52 episodes per year (equivalent to approximately once per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a series from Jamaica, approximately one-third of individuals with priapism had one or two events, and two-thirds reported 10 or more episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2812734528\"><span class=\"h2\">Precipitating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Priapism appears to be more frequent in individuals with other vaso-occlusive complications of SCD, especially pulmonary hypertension and leg ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27</a>]. However, vaso-occlusion in other sites does not appear to trigger an episode of priapism.</p><p>In one series, the most common precipitating factors for an episode of priapism in an individual with SCD were sexual activity, fever, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In another series, 54 of 104 individuals reported priapism in association with going to sleep, sleeping (45 individuals), or waking up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another 10 individuals in this series had episodes immediately after sexual intercourse.</p><p>While urination may make the affected individual more comfortable, there is no evidence that a full bladder plays a role in priapism. The association of a full bladder with stuttering priapism is likely due to common occurrence of stuttering priapism upon waking, when the bladder also happens to be full. (See <a href=\"#H3720449970\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of priapism'</a> above.)</p><p>We have also seen episodes of priapism related to the use of illicit or psychotropic drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In some cases, men may inject illicit drugs such as cocaine directly into the penis, which may contribute to the event. Management is similar regardless of these practices.</p><p>In contrast, some medications thought to precipitate priapism may not actually do so.

In such cases of prolonged priapism refractory to surgical and pharmacologic interventions, we will use exchange transfusion, with a target hemoglobin S reduction to &lt;30 percent and a total hemoglobin level typically no greater than 10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.

The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) considers the role of exchange transfusion for priapism as &quot;not established&quot; (category III), and the 2014 National Institutes of Health (NIH) SCD guidelines do not recommend transfusion for acute cases of priapism based on low-quality evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. However, our collective experience indicates that RBC apheresis is a strategy that may be effective and is worth considering when all other treatments have not been successful. All transfusions carry risks of transfusion reactions, alloimmunization, and infection, as well as other complications related to hyperviscosity.

The goal of this treatment is to cause detumescence and in turn allow oxygenated blood to re-enter the cavernosa.

Alpha-adrenergic agonists induce smooth muscle contraction in the penile helicine arteries, causing blood to flow out of the corpora cavernosa. Typically, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> diluted to 100 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and injected in a volume of 0.5 to 1 mL every five minutes for a total of three injections.

Alternatively, the remaining phenylephrine is diluted in saline to a final concentration of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> and the corporal bodies are irrigated with the diluted <span class=\"nowrap\">phenylephrine/saline</span> mixture. Failure of this therapy to produce detumescence may indicate the need for a surgical shunt procedure. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>We avoid the use of beta-adrenergic agonists and mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha-/beta-adrenergic</span> agents (eg, etilefrine; not available in the United States) in the irrigation solution because beta-adrenergic stimulation can cause smooth muscle relaxation, which increases arterial blood flow into the corpora cavernosa, worsening the priapism. Additionally, beta-adrenergic agents may cause cardiac complications including arrhythmias <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute coronary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of aspiration and irrigation with an alpha-adrenergic agonist has been demonstrated in small case series. As an example, a prospective study evaluated outcomes in 15 individuals with SCD who presented to the emergency department with priapism that lasted for &ge;4 hours and did not respond to hydration and analgesics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. There were 39 episodes of priapism among these individuals; one individual had 15 episodes. Aspiration of blood and irrigation with dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> produced immediate detumescence on 37 occasions (95 percent). There were no major short- or long-term adverse events, and none of the individuals required hospitalization.</p><p>Irrigation may be less successful in cases of prolonged priapism (eg, episodes lasting &gt;72 hours). This may be because the erectile tissue is unable to contract in the setting of severe or prolonged acidosis and hypoxia. Higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> have been used in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; however, it is preferable to intervene earlier in the course of the episode.</p><p>If the aspiration and irrigation do not result in detumescence within a reasonable period of time, a surgical shunt may be required.

In our reported series of 10 patients with priapism due to other causes (ie, not SCD) who were treated with this approach after initial aspiration and irrigation did not produce detumescence, the shunt was effective in eight; the remaining two required a penile prosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Other options include regular use of alpha-adrenergic agonists, for which the individual usually learns how to perform self-injections into the penis, the use of a penile prosthesis, regular blood transfusions, or a hormonal therapy. These approaches are very different in their associated burdens and risks, and the decision is highly patient-dependent.

It can be categorized as low-flow (ischemic, vaso-occlusive) or high-flow (nonischemic). While priapism can last for any duration of time, ischemic episodes lasting &ge;4 hours (sometimes referred to as major episodes) are especially concerning due to the greater risk of permanent tissue damage from what is essentially a compartment syndrome of the penis. Stuttering priapism (also called recurrent ischemic priapism [RIP]) is characterized by brief, recurrent episodes of transient, self-limited priapism. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-flow priapism accounts for the vast majority (&gt;95 percent) of cases of priapism in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Some series estimate that approximately 35 to 45 percent of men with SCD are affected. The median age of onset is approximately 12 to 15 years. Twenty to over 30 percent of individuals with SCD-associated priapism ultimately develop erectile dysfunction (ED). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Priapism is a clinical diagnosis made when an unwanted erection is present. Ischemic priapism is painful. Often the erection is present upon awaking from sleep. Other common precipitating factors may include sexual activity, fever, dehydration, alcohol, or illicit drugs such as cocaine. We do not believe that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> or testosterone replacement triggers an episode of priapism. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Typical presentations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2812734528\" class=\"local\">'Precipitating factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history should be used to determine the duration of the episode, circumstances associated with its onset, hydration status, medications, and recreational drugs. The general examination should focus on any possible medical conditions that could be present along with priapism, especially infections or causes of dehydration. Examination of the penis should determine the degree of tumescence and any signs of trauma. In ischemic priapism, the penis is rigid and painful with a soft glans. Blood gas analysis on blood aspirated from the corpus cavernosum is used to diagnose ischemic priapism (typical values: pH &lt;7.25, pO<sub>2</sub> &lt;30 mmHg, pCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;60 mmHg) and distinguish it from nonischemic priapism (typical values: pH 7.40, pO<sub>2</sub> &gt;90 mmHg, pCO<sub>2</sub> &lt;40 mmHg). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'History, examination, and cavernosal blood gas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete blood count (CBC) and reticulocyte count should be obtained and compared with the individual's baseline values. Individuals with fever or a white blood cell (WBC) count above their baseline should have blood cultures obtained. In selected cases (eg, confusing results from corporal blood gas, trauma), imaging of penile blood flow using color duplex ultrasonography may be helpful. Doppler ultrasonography in ischemic priapism shows absent or severely reduced blood flow in the cavernosal arteries. In nonischemic priapism, the flow velocity in cavernosal arteries is typically high, and a fistula or pseudoaneurysm may be present. (See <a href=\"#H2629506081\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing and imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For stuttering priapism or episodes lasting &lt;4 hours, patients should be advised to maintain hydration and use oral analgesics, along with other maneuvers that have been helpful in previous episodes. If the erection persists &gt;4 hours, patients should seek medical attention. Those presenting to the hospital should receive adequate analgesia, hydration, and urgent urologic evaluation. There is no evidence to support routine red blood cell (RBC) transfusion to treat acute priapism, but RBC transfusion should not be withheld if indicated for other reasons. (See <a href=\"#H358553978\" class=\"local\">'Management in the emergency department and hospital'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with an episode of priapism lasting &gt;4 hours that does not respond to conservative management, we suggest aspiration of blood from the corpus cavernosum, with or without saline irrigation, followed by injection of an alpha-adrenergic agonist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is done using a penile ring block, with or without conscious sedation. Typically, we aspirate the clot, if possible, and inject <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> (concentration, 100 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> in a volume of 0.5 to 1 mL) every five minutes for a total of three injections, consistent with American Urological Association guidelines. If the aspiration and irrigation do not result in detumescence within a reasonable period of time, a surgical shunt may be required. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Aspiration and irrigation of the corpus cavernosum'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education and discussions about priapism should be included in the routine health evaluations of boys and men with SCD. For individuals with frequent major episodes of priapism or other concerning features (eg, escalating stuttering priapism), we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is based on observational studies suggesting that hydroxyurea may reduce the likelihood of priapism in patients with SCD, similar to its role in reducing other vaso-occlusive complications. Other options may include regular RBC transfusions, a phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>, an alpha-adrenergic agonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a>), or a hormonal therapy. The available evidence on these agents for secondary prevention of priapism in SCD patients is very limited. These approaches differ considerably in their associated burdens and risks, the decision among them is highly patient-dependent, and their use should be re-evaluated over time. (See <a href=\"#H289397306\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine comprehensive care for children with sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best way to prevent ED in SCD is to rapidly treat episodes of priapism and reduce their frequency. For individuals who develop ED, management is mostly similar to those without SCD. We are especially careful with vasogenic agents, although these may be effective for some individuals. Men who have had repeated episodes of priapism may have such scar tissue that surgical treatment with a penile prosthesis is the best option.
