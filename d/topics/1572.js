AIHA is generally categorized as &quot;warm&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; based on the thermal reactivity of the autoantibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55710 \">table 1</a>) and is classified as primary (idiopathic) or secondary based on whether or not an underlying disease process is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57399 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of AIHA in children are reviewed here.

Optimal treatment of a child with AIHA depends initially upon the severity and chronicity of the anemia, the signs and symptoms, and the characteristics of the autoantibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55710 \">table 1</a>). Children with AIHA can be managed in the ambulatory setting if the anemia is not severe and there are no signs of cardiovascular compromise. At the time of initial disease presentation, however, hospitalization may be warranted to expedite the diagnostic evaluation, closely monitor the patient, and begin therapy before the anemia worsens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2811052291\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe or life-threatening anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus regarding the threshold for transfusion in AIHA; the decision to transfuse depends upon the degree and onset of anemia. Rarely, the anemia in a child with AIHA is severe and causes cardiovascular compromise (eg, when the hemoglobin is &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span>. In such cases, urgent treatment is required and includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (following urgent discussion with blood bank personnel regarding blood compatibility), <strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacotherapy (eg, glucocorticoids in patients with warm AIHA, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a> in patients with cold AIHA) (see <a href=\"#H1732425502\" class=\"local\">'Warm AIHA'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1451594257\" class=\"local\">'Cold AIHA'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Although transfusion can lead to additional hemolysis in patients with AIHA, it must be emphasized that despite the risks, <strong>transfusion therapy should not be withheld from a patient with life-threatening anemia</strong>. For patients who require urgent or emergency transfusion, joint decision making by the clinician and transfusion medicine specialist should occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-incompatible-crossmatch#H20773199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The incompatible crossmatch&quot;, section on 'Immediate management'</a>.)</p><p>Identification of compatible RBCs to transfuse into a child with AIHA can be difficult. Discussions with blood bank personnel should be initiated as early as possible in order to minimize delays in providing blood, and to avoid misunderstandings concerning the degree to which available blood units are compatible with the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-incompatible-crossmatch#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The incompatible crossmatch&quot;, section on 'AIHA and concurrent alloantibodies'</a>.)</p><p>Acute symptomatic transfusion reactions are uncommon in children with AIHA who require RBC transfusions, even when transfusing &quot;least incompatible&quot; units of blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Because transfused donor cells survive in patients with AIHA similar to the patient's own erythrocytes, transfusion is generally helpful to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of anemia, even if the transfused erythrocytes last in the circulation for only a short period of time.</p><p>Severe hemolytic transfusion reaction is more likely in patients with cold-reactive autoantibodies that fix complement and cause intravascular hemolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55710 \">table 1</a>). In such patients, strategies to reduce the likelihood of a hemolytic transfusion reaction include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warming the blood to 37&deg;C before and during the infusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beginning the transfusion at a slow rate and checking both plasma and urine samples periodically for the presence of free hemoglobin</p><p/><p>On the rare occasion when a transfusion results in more severe hemolysis, with substantial hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria, vigorous hydration should be provided to help prevent renal dysfunction. </p><p>Transfusions are required at some point in approximately 65 percent of children with AIHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]; however, in some cases, particularly those with active reticulocytosis, transfusion is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2305337498\"><span class=\"h2\">Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with paroxysmal cold hemoglobinemia (PCH) usually have an abrupt but self-limited hemolytic process. Keeping the patient warm and avoiding exposure to cold fluids are the mainstays of management. Transfusion may be required at presentation, particularly in patients with severe anemia. Treatment of PCH is discussed in greater detail separately.

The anemia tends to be mild and pharmacologic therapy is not necessary in most cases. As with PCH, management involves keeping the patient warm and avoiding exposure to cold fluids. Treatment of the underlying cause (eg, antibiotics in the case of <em>Mycoplasma</em> infection) is also an important aspect of management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Pharmacologic therapy is warranted in patients with severe symptomatic anemia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Rituximab</a> is the agent used most commonly (this is an off-label use of this drug).

For this reason, we suggest initial pharmacotherapy for children with warm-reactive AIHA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H332109890\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are the first-line therapy for warm-reactive AIHA. Glucocorticoids are preferred over other therapies because the response is generally more rapid, short-term side effects are usually manageable, and because there is greater experience with glucocorticoids in children with AIHA.</p><p>This initial dose is dependent on the severity of anemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who present with severe and symptomatic anemia (eg, hemoglobin &lt;6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> requiring hospitalization are initially treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose every six to eight hours for the first 24 to 72 hours (after which they are transitioned to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> at the dose provided below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with moderate anemia (eg, hemoglobin &ge;7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and appropriate reticulocytosis can be initially treated with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in two or three divided doses.</p><p/><p>The initial treatment response is a stabilization of the hemoglobin concentration, followed by a slow increase in the hemoglobin level.</p><p>Once an adequate response has been achieved (ie, hemoglobin &gt;9 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> which typically occurs within two to four weeks, the steroid dose can be tapered to a single daily dose as tolerated over two to four months, based on serial evaluation of the hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and direct antiglobulin test (DAT) results. Glucocorticoids should then be slowly tapered but not stopped until there is normalization of the hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and <span class=\"nowrap\">LDH/haptoglobin,</span> although the DAT may weakly remain positive. (See <a href=\"#H1294789302\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Response rates to glucocorticoid therapy in children with warm AIHA range from 50 to 80 percent, although many will relapse when the medication is tapered too quickly or discontinued abruptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Glucocorticoids have a rapid effect, within 24 to 48 hours, likely due to inhibition of the Fc receptor-mediated clearance of sensitized erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. They also diminish the production of autoantibodies, but this effect requires several weeks.</p><p>Long-term use of glucocorticoids in children is associated with complications, including weight gain, growth impairment, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms, hypertension, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, and cataracts.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1294789302\"><span class=\"h4\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring of patients with AIHA consists of regular clinical assessments and laboratory testing, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin level</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reticulocyte count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDH</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DAT (previously called the Coombs test)</p><p/><p>The frequency of monitoring depends on disease severity and treatment. Laboratory studies are typically monitored once weekly, initially, particularly to guide the early tapering of glucocorticoids. The interval between testing can be gradually increased as the clinical picture stabilizes, but monitoring should continue until the hemoglobin level and reticulocyte count have returned to normal (ie, hemoglobin &ge;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> reticulocyte count &le;100 x 10<sup>3</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/microL)</span> and the patient is stable on low-dose glucocorticoids. LDH and DAT can be tested periodically, especially after the initial therapeutic response. We typically continue monitoring patients for one year after remission has been achieved as the risk of relapse is greatest during this time. The DAT may remain weakly positive, even after complete remission has been attained. A persistent positive DAT suggests ongoing autoimmune disease and warrants further exploration for secondary etiologies such as Evans syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Long-term remission is achieved in approximately 90 percent of patients, though a substantial proportion require ongoing therapy to maintain remission. Factors associated with poor prognosis include family or personal history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease, concurrent thrombocytopenia or lymphocytopenia, and a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT, previously called Coombs test) for both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement component 3 (C3). Abrupt onset of symptoms and documented infection at the time of diagnosis are associated with a good prognosis.
